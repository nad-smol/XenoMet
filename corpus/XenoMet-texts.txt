10022212	Toxicological findings in a fatal ingestion of methamphetamine. This paper presents the case history of a fatality caused by the complications brought about by the presence of methamphetamine and ethanol. Drug concentrations are reported from samples obtained approximately 15 min after the subject was last observed to be chewing what was then believed to be gum, 3 h after the initial toxic symptoms were displayed, 6, 11, and 22 h later. The subjects conditions deteriorated over the course of this time, and he was declared dead 33 h after the initial display of toxic symptoms. The toxicological findings and concentration levels of the reported biological specimens concurred with the expected findings in a case of methamphetamine toxicity.
10024724	Methodological issues in biomonitoring of low level exposure to benzene. Data from a pilot study on unmetabolized benzene and trans,trans muconic acid (t,t-MA) excretion in filling station attendants and unexposed controls were used to afford methodological issues in the biomonitoring of low benzene exposures (around 0.1 ppm). Urinary concentrations of benzene and t,t-MA were measured by dynamic head-space capillary GC/FID and HPLC, respectively. The accuracy of the HPLC determination of t,t-MA was assessed in terms of inter- and intra-method reliability. The adequacy of urinary t,t-MA and benzene as biological markers of low benzene exposure was evaluated by analysing the relationship between personal exposure to benzene and biomarker excretion. Filling station attendants excreted significantly higher amounts of benzene, but not of t,t-MA, than controls. Adjusting for occupational benzene exposure, smokers excreted significantly higher amounts of t,t-MA, but not of unmetabolized benzene, than nonsmokers. A comparative analysis of the present and previously published biomonitoring surveys showed a good inter-study agreement regarding the amount of t,t-MA and unmetabolized benzene excreted (about 0.1-0.2 mg/l and 1-2 micrograms/l, respectively) per unit of exposure (0.1 ppm). For each biomarker, based on the distribution of parameters observed in the pilot study, we calculated the minimum sample size required to estimate the population mean with given confidence and precision.
10025747	EMLA cream as a topical anesthetic for the repeated mechanical debridement of venous leg ulcers: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A granulating surface is important for skin grafting and healing of leg ulcers. Mechanical debridement to remove necrotic tissue often must be stopped before completion because of pain. Our purpose was to assess the effect of EMLA cream on the number of debridements required to obtain a clean ulcer and on pain during debridement and to determine its safety after repeated doses. In this randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 69 patients with venous leg ulcers received cream before debridement until a clean ulcer was obtained (or a maximum of 15 debridements). EMLA decreased the median number of debridements required for a clean ulcer (EMLA 11.5, placebo >15; P = .019) and decreased pain by 50% (P = .003). Plasma levels of lidocaine, prilocaine, and their main metabolites were low without any apparent accumulation. EMLA produces effective pain relief for the debridement of leg ulcers and shortens the time to a clean ulcer.
10027632	Highly sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic assay for coumarin 7-hydroxylation and 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylation by human liver cytochrome P450 enzymes. A highly sensitive method for the determination of coumarin 7-hydroxylation and 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylation by human cytochrome P450 (P450 or CYP) enzymes was developed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The newly developed HPLC method was found to be about 100-fold more sensitive than the previous spectrofluorimetric method in detecting the metabolite 7-hydroxycoumarin (umbelliferone). With this high sensitivity, the kinetics of coumarin 7-hydroxylation and 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylation catalyzed by human liver microsomal and recombinant P450 enzymes were determined more precisely. With 36 different substrate concentrations in these two reactions, coumarin 7-hydroxylation was found to be catalyzed mainly by a single enzyme CYP2A6 and 7-ethoxycoumarin was oxidized by at least two enzymes CYP2E1 and CYP1A2 in human liver microsomes.
10027642	Direct assay of nonopioid analgesics and their metabolites in human urine by capillary electrophoresis and capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) was used for the analysis of nonopioid analgesics and their metabolites directly in urine samples. A simple, reliable screening method was developed that allows identification of the drug and/or its metabolites in urine after oral application of paracetamol, acetylsalicylic acid, antipyrine, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen and propyphenazone by their migration in CE and by their UV spectra recorded with a diode-array detector in a common CE-UV system with 50 mM borax pH 9.4 as separation buffer. For the CE-electrospray (ESI)-MS coupling a volatile 50 mM ammonium acetate buffer at pH 9.8 was used. In order to analyze the metabolic pattern in more detail different methods were developed for each drug. The separation of the metabolites of acetylsalicylic acid could be improved by injection of the urine sample at the cathodic side of the capillary. In order to identify antipyrine as neutral compound as well as its neutral metabolites-a micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) method was developed.
10027661	Opposite effects of lornoxicam co-administration on phenprocoumon pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. To investigate the effect of co-administration of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) lornoxicam on the pharmacokinetics of (R)- and (S)-phenprocoumon and their effect on factor II and VII activities. Six healthy male volunteers completed an open crossover study. Plasma concentrations of (R)- and (S)-phenprocoumon and activities of coagulation factors II and VII were measured after a single oral dose of 9 mg phenprocoumon racemate. In the second session, lornoxicam administration was started 3 days before phenprocoumon administration and continued twice daily until the last blood sample was drawn. Lornoxicam co-administration resulted in a statistically significant increase of the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of the more potent (S)-isomer of phenprocoumon from a median value of 100 (range 68-146) mg x h x 1(-1) to 124 (92-239) mg x h x 1(-1). For the (R)-isomer, the AUC increase from 96 (70-142) mg x h x 1(-1) in the absence to 108 (75-155) mg x h x 1(-1) in the presence of lornoxicam was not statistically significant. In a model-based analysis, an increase of (S)-phenprocoumon and (R)-phenprocoumon bioavailability of 14% [95% CI (9%, 19%)] and 6% (2%, 10%) and a decrease of their clearances by 15% (8%, 21%) and 6% (0%, 13%) was obtained. Lornoxicam co-administration did not influence the free fractions of (R)- or (S)-phenprocoumon. Contrary to what was expected from the changes in pharmacokinetics, a statistically significant decrease in the effect of phenprocoumon on factor II and VII activity was observed for the sessions with lornoxicam co-administration. For factor VII, lornoxicam was found to increase the concentration causing half-maximal effect (C50) of phenprocoumon by 70% [95% CI (38%, 111%)]. Co-administration of lornoxicam at the upper limit of recommended doses mainly altered the pharmacokinetics of the more potent (S)-isomer and to a lesser degree those of (R)-phenprocoumon. Despite these changes in pharmacokinetics, a decrease of the effect on factor II and VII activity was observed. These results suggest that in the case of lornoxicam co-administration in a patient treated with phenprocoumon the prothrombin time should be monitored closely.
10051064	LC/ESI-MS allows simultaneous and specific quantification of SDZ RAD and cyclosporine, including groups of their metabolites in human blood. An analytic technique using liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with electrospray-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) has been developed for the simultaneous determination of the new immunosuppressant SDZ RAD (40-O-[2-hydroxy)ethylrapamycin) and cyclosporine (Cs), including their metabolites in blood. With the time-sparing, automated on-line extraction technique, the recovery of SDZ RAD averaged 95% and that of Cs, 94%. The calibration lines were linear from 0.5 to 100 microg/L (r2 = 0.99) for SDZ RAD and from 10 to 1,000 microg/L (r2 = 0.99) for Cs. The method has been tested on blood samples from renal transplant recipients taken between 1 and 5 hours after oral SDZ RAD and Cs administration. In blood, we found the following metabolites: Hydroxy-SDZ RAD, dihydroxy-SDZ RAD, demethyl-SDZ RAD, and the ring-opened form of SDZ RAD. The main metabolite of SDZ RAD in blood was hydroxy-SDZ RAD. This novel LC/ESI-MS technique provided an excellent method for simultaneous quantitative monitoring of SDZ RAD and Cs, including their relevant groups of metabolites in patients treated simultaneously with these immunosuppressants.
1006719	Isolation and identification of a sulfur-containing metabolite of spironolactone from human urine. In the urine of normal subjects who were given an oral dose of 500 mg spironolactone (3-(3-oxo-7alpha-acetylthio-17beta-hydroxy-4-androsten-17alpha-yl)-propionic acid gamma-lactone; Aldactone) together with 100uCi H-20, 21 spironolactone, a so far unknown major metabolite has been detected by thin layer chromatography. The metabolite then could be isolated by means of counter-current-distribution. According to masspectral and magnetic resonance data, the metabolite has been assigned the structure of 3-(3-oxo-7alpha-methyl sulfonyl-6beta, 17beta-dihydroxy-4-androsten-17alpha-yl)-propionic acid gamma-lactone. By oxidation of the corresponding methylsulfinyl compound - another already known metabolite of spironolactone - with m-chloroperbenzoic acid, a compound has been isolated which proved to be identical with the new metabolite according to TLC, MS and NMR.
10068153	Interactions of buspirone with itraconazole and rifampicin: effects on the pharmacokinetics of the active 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)-piperazine metabolite of buspirone. The effects of inhibition and induction of the metabolism of buspirone on the plasma concentrations of 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)-piperazine (a piperazine metabolite), the principal active metabolite of buspirone, were investigated. Two separate randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over studies with two phases were carried out in healthy volunteers. In Study I, six subjects took itraconazole 200 mg daily or matched placebo orally for 4 days. On day 4, 10 mg buspirone was administered orally. In study II, six subjects took rifampicin 600 mg daily or matched placebo orally for 5 days. On day 6, 30 mg buspirone was administered orally. Buspirone and piperazine metabolite concentrations in plasma were determined by gas chromatography. Itraconazole decreased the mean AUC of the piperazine metabolite by 50% (P<0.05) and the Cmax by 57% (P<0.05) compared with placebo, whereas the mean AUC and Cmax of unchanged buspirone were increased 14.5-fold (P<0.05) and 10.5-fold (P<0.05), respectively, by itraconazole. Rifampicin had no significant effect on the AUC of the piperazine metabolite, but it increased the mean Cmax of the piperazine metabolite by 35% (P=0.08). The mean AUC and Cmax of parent buspirone were reduced by 91% (P<0.05) and 85% (P<0.05), respectively, by rifampicin. The mean ratio of the AUC of the piperazine metabolite to that of buspirone was decreased 34-fold (P<0.05) by itraconazole and increased 7.6-fold (P<0.05) by rifampicin. In conclusion, itraconazole and rifampicin caused only relatively minor changes in the plasma concentrations of the active piperazine metabolite of buspirone, although they had drastic effects on the concentrations of parent buspirone.
10075405	Ethyl glucuronide--a marker of alcohol consumption and a relapse marker with clinical and forensic implications. Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) is a non-volatile, water-soluble, direct metabolite of ethanol that can be detected in body fluids and hair. We investigated urine and serum samples from three patient groups: (1) 33 in-patients in acute alcohol withdrawal; (2) 30 detoxified in-patients (treated for at least 4 weeks) from a 'motivation station'; and (3) 43 neuro-rehabilitation patients (non-alcoholics; most of them suffering from stroke, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson's disease etc.) using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) with deuterium-labelled EtG as the internal standard and additionally in the second group of patients using liquid chromatography (LC/MS-MS). We found no correlation between the concentration of EtG in urine at hospitalization and the blood-ethanol concentration (r = 0.17), the time frame of detection (r = 0.5) or the total amount of clomethiazole required for the treatment of withdrawal symptoms (r = 0.28). In four out of 30 in-patients from the 'motivation station'--where neither clinical impression nor routine laboratory findings gave indications of relapse--concentrations of EtG in urine ranged between 4.2 and 196.6 mg/l. EtG concentrations in urine of between 2.89 and 23.49 mg/l were found in seven out of 43 neuro-rehabilitation patients using GC/MS. The GC/MS and the LC/MS-MS results showed a correlation of 0.98 with Pearson's correlation test and 1.0 with Spearman's correlation test. We suggest that EtG is a marker of alcohol consumption that can be detected for an extended time period after the complete elimination of alcohol from the body. When used as a relapse marker with a specific time frame of detection intermediate between short- and long-term markers, EtG fills a clinically as well as forensically important gap. Its specificity and sensitivity exceed those of all other known ethanol markers.
10077437	Prodrug for bioreductive activation-independent delivery of menahydroquinone-4: human liver enzymatic activation and its action in warfarin-poisoned human liver. The N,N-dimethylglycine esters of menahydroquinone-4 (1-mono, 1; 4-mono, 2; 1,4-bis, 3) were established in previous reports as prodrugs that could achieve the systemic bioreductive activation-independent delivery of menahydroquinone-4 (MKH), the active form of menaquinone-4 (MK-4), in rat. The present study was undertaken to investigate if the prodrugs could undergo cleavage to parent drug (MKH) by a human tissues enzyme catalyzed hydrolytic pathway, the mechanism of the prodrugs for vitamin K-dependent carboxylation in human liver and their action in the warfarin poisoned human liver. The hydrolysis of the esters was shown to be catalyzed by esterases located in human liver but not in human plasma. The susceptibility of the esters to undergo human liver esterase hydrolysis was affected by the esterified position: 1>2>3. By using a human liver microsomal test system, the stimulation of vitamin K-dependent carboxylation with the prodrugs was determined. The prodrug could stimulate the carboxylation activity in the absence of dithiothreitol, an artificial activator of the reductive activation pathway of MK-4. The carboxylation activity of the prodrug was strongly inhibited in the presence of eserine, an esterase inhibitor. The prodrug could also stimulate the carboxylase under warfarin-poisoned conditions, where the vitamin K cycle was strongly inhibited. The results confirmed that the prodrug could generate MKH in human liver (active site), and that the resultant MKH could act as a cofactor for the carboxylase without reductive activation processes of MK-4 to MKH. Such bioreductive activation-independent vitamin K-dependent carboxylation characteristic of the prodrug leads to enhanced pharmacological efficacy in the treatment of hypoprothrombinaemia induced in patients with coumarin and cephalosporin therapies.
10078836	Species differences in the hepatic and intestinal metabolism of cyclosporine. 1. Cyclosporin A (cyclosporine, CSA) is an immunosuppressive drug with a narrow therapeutic index. In the present study the metabolism of CSA was investigated in the liver and small intestinal microsomes obtained from rat, hamster, rabbit, dog, baboon and man by measuring the disappearance of CSA and the formation of the principal metabolites of CSA, namely hydroxylated and N-demethylated CSA. 2. CSA was metabolized at a very slow rate (2-8% metabolism in 30 min) in rat liver microsomes whereas microsomes from dog livers were very efficient (70-100% metabolism in 30 min) in metabolizing CSA. Hydroxylation and N-demethylation accounted for most of the CSA metabolized in all the species tested. 3. Microsomes from the small intestine produced qualitatively a similar metabolic profile as compared with the microsomes from the liver, but at a slower rate in all the species tested. The relative importance of the different metabolic pathways, however, differed between species. 4. This study points to the importance of recognizing the similarities and the differences in the metabolism of CSA in different species when data from animal studies are extrapolated to man.
10078842	A comparison of 1H8- and 2H8-toluene toxicokinetics in men. 1. To examine the bioequivalence of an isotope-labelled tracer to study toxicant disposition, we conducted 33 controlled human exposures to a mixture of 50 ppm 1H8-toluene and 50 ppm 2H8-toluene for 2 h, and measured concentrations in blood and breath, and metabolite levels in urine for 100 h post-exposure. 2. A physiologically based kinetic (PBK) model found that compared with 1H8-toluene, 2H8-toluene had a 6.4+/-13% (mean+/-SD) lower AUC, a 6.5+/-13% higher systemic clearance (1.46+/-0.27 versus 1.38+/-0.25 l/h-kg), a 17+/-22% larger terminal volume of distribution (66.4+/-14 versus 57.2+/-10 l/kg) and a 9.7+/-26% longer terminal half-life (38+/-12 versus 34+/-10 h) (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). 3. The higher 2H8-toluene clearance may have been due to an increased rate of ring oxidation, consistent with the 17% higher observed fraction of 2H5- versus 1H5-cresol metabolites in urine. 4. The larger terminal volume and half-lives for 2H8-toluene suggested a higher adipose tissue/blood partition coefficient. 5. Observed isotope differences were small compared with interindividual differences in 1H8-toluene kinetics from previous studies. 6. The PBK model allowed us to ascribe observed isotope differences in solvent toxicokinetics to underlying physiologic mechanisms.
10079307	In vivo evaluation in mice and metabolism in blood of human volunteers of [123I]iodo-PK11195: a possible single-photon emission tomography tracer for visualization of inflammation. We report the in vivo evaluation (biodistribution, displacement and metabolization in blood, brain and heart) in mice and the metabolism in blood of human volunteers of iodine-123 labelled 1-(2-iodophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methyl-propyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide ([123I]iodo-PK11195), a potential radioligand for visualization of inflammation in humans by single-photon emission tomography. In three series of 18 white mice (NMRI, 20-25 g), the concentration of radioactivity was measured during 48 h. Blood samples were taken, organs and intestines were excised, excretion was collected and all tissues were weighed and counted for radioactivity. The tissue uptake of radioactivity was measured as % of the injected activity/g of tissue. The excretion was expressed as % of the injected activity. Selective tissue uptake was investigated by pretreatment of another three series of 18 mice with cold PK11195 (1 mg/kg body weight). There was an inflow of [123I]iodo-PK11195 in the brain and among peripheral organs, heart (42.3%), lungs (133.5%) and kidneys (18.4%) had the highest uptake. After pretreatment with cold PK11195, there was a decrease in accumulation in the latter three organs, especially in heart (ca. 55%) and lungs (ca. 80%). Metabolite analysis was performed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). First, the extraction yield of [123I]iodo-PK11195 from blood and tissue was assessed, and found to be >90%. From blank blood samples and organs spiked with [123I]iodo-PK11195 it was concluded that no metabolization took place during the extraction procedure. Analysis of plasma, brain and heart of mice showed that 10 min p.i. [123I]iodo-PK11195 was the only significant (ca. 95%) radioactive compound in brain and heart where-as in plasma other radioactive products (>60%) appeared. Analysis of plasma samples of the three human volunteers at 7, 20, 37 and 50 min p.i. showed that [123I]iodo-PK11195 rapidly decomposes into two polar metabolites, which at these time points accounted for, respectively 31%, 62%, 75% and 77% of the total activity.
10080644	Analytical methodology for enantiomers of salbutamol in human urine for application in doping control. Liquid chromatographic procedure with fluorimetric detection for chiral separation and quantification of salbutamol enantiomers in urine samples has been developed. The extraction of free salbutamol from urine has been considered using liquid-liquid and solid-phase procedures. The effect of pH, salting-out effect and organic solvent has been studied in liquid-liquid extraction from aqueous and urine samples. For solid-phase extraction, different mechanisms (polar, non-polar, cation-exchange and interactions with a polymeric phase) have been tested and the effect of the urine matrix on the extraction recoveries has been considered. Bond-Elut Certify extraction cartridges provided the best specificity and good recoveries for salbutamol in urine. The sample is acidified, applied to the preconditioned cartridges and, after a washing step, salbutamol enantiomers are eluted with a mixture of chloroform and 2-propanol (80:20, v/v) containing 2% ammonia. Atenolol is used as external standard. Enantioselective separation is accomplished with a Chirex 3022 stationary phase (urea type silica-bonded chiral phase) using a mobile phase containing hexane-dichloromethane-methanol-trifluoroacetic acid (250:218:31:1, v/v) and fluorimetric detection with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 230 and 309 nm, respectively. The method proposed is rapid, selective and sensitive, and seems to be useful to differentiate between an authorized and a prohibited use of the drug in doping control.
10094790	Femtomole quantitation of 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecine (SN-38) in plasma samples by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. 7-Ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecine (SN-38) is the active metabolite of the topoisomerase I inhibitor and antineoplastic agent, irinotecan (CPT-11). Here, we present a new and sensitive reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the determination of SN-38 in human plasma samples. Sample pretreatment involves a protein precipitation of 1-mL samples with 2 mL of acetonitrile, followed by a one-step solvent extraction with 5 mL of chloroform, with camptothecine used as internal standard. Chromatographic separation was achieved on an analytical column packed with Hypersil ODS material (100 x 4.6 mm i.d., 5 microm P.S.), and isocratic elution with a mixture of acetonitrile:0.1 M ammonium acetate containing 10 mM tetrabutylammonium sulfate (23:77, v/v), pH 5.3 (hydrochloric acid). The column effluent was monitored at excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 556 nm, respectively. The limit of quantitation of the method presented was at the low femtomole level ( approximately 8.4 fmol; equivalent to 5 pg/mL), with the standard curves being linear over nearly three orders of magnitude. Intraassay precision was <9%, while interassay variations were between 2 and 5%. The extraction efficiency was concentration independent and averaged 88.0 +/- 14.3% (mean +/- standard deviation; n = 59). The described method will be used in future studies to assess the extent of enterohepatic recirculation of SN-38 in cancer patients following intravenous CPT-11 treatment.
10096261	Effects of the CYP2D6*10 allele on the steady-state plasma concentrations of haloperidol and reduced haloperidol in Japanese patients with schizophrenia. The CYP2D6*10 (*10) allele that causes decreased CYP2D6 activity is present in Asians with a high frequency of about 50%. In this study we studied the effects of the *10 allele on the steady-state plasma concentrations (Css) of haloperidol and reduced haloperidol. The subjects were 67 Japanese inpatients with schizophrenia who had only the wild-type or *10 alleles. Thirty-four patients were homozygous for the wild-type allele, and 26 were heterozygous and 7 were homozygous for the *10 allele. All patients had been receiving 12 mg/day haloperidol for at least 2 weeks. Plasma concentrations of haloperidol and reduced haloperidol were measured by HPLC. The mean +/- SD values of haloperidol Css in the patients with 0, 1, and 2 *10 alleles were 22.8+/-11.0, 30.1+/-10.6, and 31.2+/-21.2 nmol/L, respectively, and those values for reduced haloperidol were 6.1+/-2.9, 9.5+/-3.7, and 9.9+/-6.2 nmol/L, respectively. The mean haloperidol Css was significantly (P < .05) higher in the patients with 1 *10 allele than in those with no *10 alleles. The mean Css of reduced haloperidol was significantly (P < .05) higher in the patients with 1 and 2 *10 alleles than in those with no *10 alleles. This study suggests that the *10 allele plays an important role in controlling the Css of both haloperidol and reduced haloperidol, especially in Asian subjects.
10117	Saturable metabolic pathways for ethotoin in man. 1. The urinary excretion pattern of ethotoin and five metabolites were examined in three patients receiving continuous treatment with ethotoin at two dose levels, in order to investigate the mechanism behind the dose-dependent kinetics of this anticonvulsant drug. 2. The results suggest a partial saturation in the dealkylation process at high dose levels in three patients. 3. A rough approximation of the Michaelis-Menten constants for different enzymatic processes was attempted. On the basis of the results obtained, the p-hydroxylation may be a saturable process. 4. The dose-dependent kinetics of ethotoin in man seem to be explicable by the existence of partly saturable enzymatic pathways.
1012347	Pharmacokinetics of spironolactone in man. Five healthy male volunteers received 500 mg Aldactone orally together 100 muCi 3H-20-21-spironolactone; one elderly patient received 1 mCi 3H-spironolactone without additional 'cold' drug. For 6 days the disposition kinetics of the drug were studied in plasma, urine and feces. The tritium concentrations in plasma reached a peak between 25-40 min after administration amounting to 2-3% of the dose/1. Up to the 12th h, they fell rapidly and showed a monoexponential decline (t 1/2: 2.57 +/- 0.27 days) between the 36th and 96th h. Later, a striking increase in the speed of elimination of radioactivity from plasma (t 1/2: 1.66 +/- 0.21 days) was observed. The biological half-life of labeled material in plasma was longer than that of fluorigenic compounds. 47-57% of the dose were excreted in urine and the remaining amount could be detected in feces (total recovery 90%). The half-life of the urinary excretion rate was distinctly shorter (t 1/2: 0.9 +/- 0.11 days) than that of total radioactivity in plasma. This, together with an observed increase of the polar fraction in urine from 35 up to 85%, which was accompanied by a decrease in plasma from 55 to 35%, suggests either tubular reabsorption or enterohepatic recirculation of lipophilic compounds. TLC-separation of the lipophilic fraction in urine revealed two previously unknown compounds of which the main congener was identified as 3-(3-oxo-7 alpha-methylsulfonyl-6 beta, 17 beta-dihydroxy-4-androsten-17 alpha-yl) propionic acid gamma-lactone, as well as canrenone and the metabolites which have already been described (Karim and Brown, 1972; Karim et al., 1975). This metabolite represents the main lipophilic degradation product in urine within the first hours, whereas the 6 beta-OH-7 alpha-methylsulfinyl-spirolactone leveled off and seemed to be and endexcretion product. For further characterisation, the polar fraction was subjected to acidic hydrolysis. The known metabolic pathways of spironolactone degradation are discussed.
10192416	Accuracy of five on-site immunoassay drugs-of-abuse testing devices. Many current "on-site" urine drug-testing products claim performance equivalent to laboratory testing. Five commercially available products (PharmScreen, Roche TestCup, Accusign DOA 2, Status DS, and American Bio Medica-Rapid Drug Screen) were challenged with quality-control specimens of known drug metabolite concentrations, 25% above and 25% below the SAMHSA cutoffs, and with known positive and negative donor specimens previously analyzed by immunoassay and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results indicate discrepancies between claims and performance for all products, particularly with amphetamines. The implications for employer-based drug testing are discussed.
10192756	Inhibition of CYP2C9 by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: in vitro studies with tolbutamide and (S)-warfarin using human liver microsomes. To investigate the in vitro potential of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to inhibit two CYP2C9-catalysed reactions, tolbutamide 4-methylhydroxylation and (S)-warfarin 7-hydroxylation. The formation of 4-hydroxytolbutamide from tolbutamide and that of 7-hydroxywarfarin from (S)-warfarin as a function of different concentrations of SSRIs and some of their metabolites was studied in microsomes from three human livers. Both tolbutamide 4-methylhydroxylation and (S)-warfarin 7-hydroxylation followed one enzyme Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Kinetic analysis of 4-hydroxytolbutamide formation yielded a mean apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) of 133 microM and a mean apparent maximal velocity (Vmax) of 248 pmol x min(-1) x mg(-1); formation of 7-hydroxywarfarin yielded a mean Km of 3.7 microM and a mean Vmax of 10.5 pmol x min(-1) x mg(-1). Amongst the SSRIs and some of their metabolites tested, only fluvoxamine markedly inhibited both reactions. The average computed inhibition constant (Ki) values and ranges of fluvoxamine when tolbutamide and (S)-warfarin were used as substrate, were 13.3 (6.4-17.3) microM and 13.0 (8.4-18.7) microM, respectively. The average Ki value of fluoxetine for (S)-warfarin 7-hydroxylation was 87.0 (57.0-125) microM. Amongst the SSRIs tested, fluvoxamine was shown to be the most potent inhibitor of both tolbutamide 4-methylhydroxylation and (S)-warfarin 7-hydroxylation. Fluoxetine, norfluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, desmethylsertraline, citalopram, desmethylcitalopram had little or no effect on CYP2C9 activity in vitro. This is consistent with in vivo data indicating that amongst the SSRIs, fluvoxamine has the greatest potential for inhibiting CYP2C9-mediated drug metabolism.
10193676	Effect of erythromycin and itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics of oral lignocaine. Lignocaine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme (CYP3A4), and has a moderate to high extraction ratio resulting in oral bioavailability of 30%. We have studied the possible effect of two inhibitors of CYP3A4, erythromycin and itraconazole, on the pharmacokinetics of oral lignocaine in nine volunteers using a cross-over study design. The subjects were given erythromycin orally (500 mg three times a day), itraconazole (200 mg once a day) or placebo for four days. On day 4, each subject ingested a single dose of 1 mg/kg of oral lignocaine. Plasma samples were collected until 10 hr and concentrations of lignocaine and its major metabolite, monoethylglycinexylidide were measured by gas chromatography. Both erythromycin and itraconazole increased the area under the lignocaine plasma concentration-time curve [AUC(0-infinity)] and lignocaine peak concentrations by 40-70% (P<0.05). Compared to placebo and itraconazole, erythromycin increased monoethylglycinexylidide peak concentrations by approximately 40% (P<0.01) and AUC(0-infinity) by 60% (P<0.01). The clinical implication of this study is that erythromycin and itraconazole may significantly increase the plasma concentrations and toxicity of oral lignocaine. The extent of the interaction of lignocaine with these CYP3A4 inhibitors was, however, less than that of, e.g. midazolam or buspirone, and it did not correlate with the CYP3A4 inhibiting potency of erythromycin and itraconazole.
10197418	Identification of urinary metabolites of clemastine after oral administration to man. The metabolism of clemastine, 2-[2-[1-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-phenylethoxylethyl])-1-methylpyrrolidin e, has been studied in three adult male volunteers after a single oral dose of 20 mg as the fumarate. After enzymatic hydrolysis solvent extracts of urine were derivatized with N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide-ammonium iodide and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The structures of metabolites were determined on the basis of electron impact and chemical ionization mass spectra and the identities of some (e.g. carbinol, 4-chlorobenzophenone and 4-chlorophenylstyrene) were confirmed by use of authentic standards. The principal route of metabolism of clemastine in man involves direct oxidation, O-dealkylation (fission of the ether bond), aromatic hydroxylation, aliphatic oxidation, alcoholic dehydration, and then enzymatic hydrolysis. Of the total amount of metabolites excreted in the urine 35% was carbinol (metabolite M3, major metabolite), 15% was M1, 17% was M2, 11% was M4, 9% was M5, 8% was M6 and 5% was M7.
10197480	Possible preferential metabolism of xylene isomers following occupational exposure to mixed xylenes. Solvent exposures commonly involve mixtures of substances or mixtures of isomers of a single solvent. These may be metabolised through common pathways, resulting in the potential for metabolic interactions. These may then lead to accumulation of solvent or metabolic intermediates, some of which may be toxic. This paper describes a pilot study conducted to determine the correlation between airborne xylene isomers and the appearance of methylhippuric acid (MHA) isomers in urine of workers exposed mainly to xylene. The project also aimed to determine whether there is preferential metabolism of any isomer by comparison of the ratios of airborne isomers with the ratios of metabolite isomers appearing in urine. A total of 12 workers (11 male, 1 female) were recruited into this study, with 2 of the participants providing samples on more than one occasion. Workers included flooring contractors (5), printers (2), chemical manufacturers (2), histology technicians (2) and one householder using a xylene-based varnish. Subjects were aged between 24 and 48 years (37.6+/-2.0 years; mean +/- SEM). After giving informed consent, workers provided a prework and postwork urine sample on a midweek work day. Samples were stored frozen prior to analysis. Breathing-zone air samples were collected using personal air samplers at 50 ml/min. Solvents were trapped on activated-charcoal sampling tubes. Subjects wore pumps for 18-304 (178+/-24) min on the same day on which urine samples were collected. Xylene exposures ranged from 1.6 to over 7000 ppm. In all, 7 of 16 measurements exceeded the Australian TWA standard of 80 ppm. Two of the flooring contractors wore respiratory protective equipment (RPE) and the two histopathology technicians used workplace ventilation systems. Total urinary MHA output ranged from 10 to 8000 mmol/mol creatinine, with 6 of 16 samples exceeding the modified biological exposure index of 702 mmol/mol. Correlations between airborne concentrations of individual xylene isomers and their corresponding MHA isomers were poor but improved when workers using RPE were excluded from the analysis. Gradients of the regression lines (millimoles of MHA per mole of creatinine per parts per million of xylene) were 3.2 for o-isomers, 7.0 for p-isomers, and 14.4 for m-isomers. Comparisons of isomer ratios of xylene in air were made with the corresponding ratio of MHA isomers in urine. These revealed higher ratios of m-MHA to other MHA isomers than those of m-xylene to the other xylene isomers. The MHA isomer ratios were expected to be the same as the airborne xylene isomer ratios if there were no preferential elimination of any isomer. m-MHA appeared in urine in a greater proportion than would be predicted from the proportion of m-xylene detected in air. The time course of the appearance of MHA isomers in urine also suggests that interactions were taking place, with m-MHA appearing in high proportion in urine following several days of repeated heavy xylene exposure. On a single moderate exposure, m-MHA appeared initially in high proportion in the first few hours but was undetectable in urine after 18 h. p-MHA was detectable for up to 6 h after exposure, and o-MHA remained detectable after 18 h. This study suggests that excretion of m-MHA in urine is favoured over that of the other isomers following exposure to mixed xylenes. This is independent of airborne xylene isomer composition and suggests that the metabolism of m-xylene occurs preferentially to that of the other isomers. It is not clear at which step in the metabolism of xylene this preference occurs, although other work indicates that the initial oxidation of xylene to methylbenzyl alcohol by cytochrome P450 2E1 occurs at the same rate for each isomer. These findings suggest that there is potential for metabolic interactions between xylene isomers and that these may be the basis for xylene toxicity.
10201824	Synthesis of glucuronides of multidrug resistance reversing drug MS-209. We synthesized the glucuronides of MS-209 to identify the two main unknown metabolites in human urine. Reaction of MS-209 and glucuronyl trichloroacetimidate gave two beta-isomers, which were each glucuronate of (R)- and (S)-MS-209. These spectrum data were identical with the metabolites.
10202964	High-performance liquid chromatographic method for the determination of atracurium and laudanosine in human plasma. Application to pharmacokinetics. A high-performance liquid chromatographic method coupled with fluorimetric detection has been developed for the determination of atracurium and its major metabolite, laudanosine, in human plasma. The detection is performed at 240 nm for excitation and 320 nm for emission. Verapamil was used as the internal standard. The proposed technique, involving the direct precipitation of plasma proteins is reproducible, selective and sensitive. Linear detector responses were observed for the calibration curve standards in the range of 40 to 2000 ng/ml. Precision, expressed as C.V., was in the range 1 to 14%. The limit of quantification for both atracurium and laudanosine was 40 ng/ml. The method has been validated and stability tests under various conditions have been performed. This method has been used to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of atracurium and laudanosine in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.
10207612	Metabolism of benzene in human liver microsomes: individual variations in relation to CYP2E1 expression. In human liver microsomes the oxidations of benzene, chlorzoxazone, aniline, dimethylformamide, and 4-nitrophenol were significantly correlated with each other and with the level of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2E1 estimated by immunoblotting. Moreover, benzene oxidation to water-soluble metabolites was suppressed by 0.1 mM diethyldithiocarbamate, supposedly a specific inhibitor of CYP2E1 at this level. None of these metabolic rates correlated with immunochemically determined levels of CYP1A2, 2C9, and 3A4 nor oxidation of 7-ethoxyresorufin, tolbutamide, and nifedipine. Benzene oxidation to water-soluble metabolites was characterized by typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The different benzene K(m) values seen in individual human microsomal samples were not correlated with the level or activity of CYP1A2, 2C9, 2E1, and 3A4 but could be due to CYP2E1 microheterogeneity. The lowest K(m) for benzene oxidation could be related to C/D and/or c1/c2 polymorphism of CYP2E1 gene. Covalent binding of benzene reactive metabolites to microsomal proteins was also correlated with the CYP2E1 metabolic rates and immunochemical levels. At high concentrations of benzene covalent binding was inversely related to benzene concentrations (as well as to formation of water-soluble metabolites) in agreement with the view that secondary metabolites, mainly benzoquinone, are responsible for the covalent binding.
10216279	6alpha-hydroxylation of taurochenodeoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid by CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes. The aim of the present study was to identify the enzymes in human liver catalyzing hydroxylations of bile acids. Fourteen recombinant expressed cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, human liver microsomes from different donors, and selective cytochrome P450 inhibitors were used to study the hydroxylation of taurochenodeoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid. Recombinant expressed CYP3A4 was the only enzyme that was active towards these bile acids and the enzyme catalyzed an efficient 6alpha-hydroxylation of both taurochenodeoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid. The Vmax for 6alpha-hydroxylation of taurochenodeoxycholic acid by CYP3A4 was 18.2 nmol/nmol P450/min and the apparent Km was 90 microM. Cytochrome b5 was required for maximal activity. Human liver microsomes from 10 different donors, in which different P450 marker activities had been determined, were separately incubated with taurochenodeoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid. A strong correlation was found between 6alpha-hydroxylation of taurochenodeoxycholic acid, CYP3A levels (r2=0.97) and testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation (r2=0.9). There was also a strong correlation between 6alpha-hydroxylation of lithocholic acid, CYP3A levels and testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation (r2=0.7). Troleandomycin, a selective inhibitor of CYP3A enzymes, inhibited 6alpha-hydroxylation of taurochenodeoxycholic acid almost completely at a 10 microM concentration. Other inhibitors, such as alpha-naphthoflavone, sulfaphenazole and tranylcypromine had very little or no effect on the activity. The apparent Km for 6alpha-hydroxylation of taurochenodeoxycholic by human liver microsomes was high (716 microM). This might give an explanation for the limited formation of 6alpha-hydroxylated bile acids in healthy humans. From the present results, it can be concluded that CYP3A4 is active in the 6alpha-hydroxylation of both taurochenodeoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid in human liver.
10217337	Influence of oxcarbazepine and methsuximide on lamotrigine concentrations in epileptic patients with and without valproic acid comedication: results of a retrospective study. The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the influence of oxcarbazepine (OCBZ) and methsuximide (MSM) on lamotrigine (LTG) serum concentrations. The effect of OCBZ compared to carbamazepine (CBZ) and the effect of MSM on LTG serum concentrations were examined in patients with and without valproic acid (VPA) comedication. Altogether, 376 samples from 222 patients were analyzed in routine drug monitoring. Two or more serum samples from the same patient were considered only if the comedication had been changed. For statistical evaluation, regression analytical methods and an analysis of variance were performed. For the analysis of variance, the LTG serum concentration in relation to LTG dose/ body weight--level-to-dose ratio (LDR), in (microg/mL)/(mg/kg)--was calculated and compared for different drug combinations. The nonlinear regression analysis including the LTG dose per body weight, age, gender, and the different kinds of comedication revealed that these variables have a significant influence on LTG serum concentration (r2 = 0.724). The relationship between LTG dose/body weight and serum concentration deviates only slightly from linearity, the LTG concentration was about 18% lower in women than in men, and age had a significant influence. The data indicate that children have significantly lower LTG concentrations than adults on a comparable LTG dose per body weight and that children may be more prone to enzyme induction by comedicated drugs. Methsuximide has a strong inducing effect on the LTG metabolism and decreases the LTG concentrations markedly (about 70% compared to LTG monotherapy). Carbamazepine also reduces the LTG concentrations considerably (by 54%). The inducing effect of OCBZ (29%) was less pronounced but also significant. The inducing effect of MSM, CBZ, and OCBZ was also seen in combination with VPA: VPA alone increases the LTG concentration approximately 211%, whereas in addition to MSM (8%), CBZ (21%), or OCBZ (111%), the increase of LTG was significantly smaller. The analysis of variance confirmed the results of the regression analysis. The effect of MSM on the LTG concentration should be considered if MSM is added or withdrawn in patients treated with LTG. Oxcarbazepine had a less pronounced inducing effect on LTG metabolism compared to CBZ. If CBZ is replaced by OCBZ as comedication, an increase in LTG serum concentrations should be expected.
10219964	Effects of arachidonic acid, prostaglandins, retinol, retinoic acid and cholecalciferol on xenobiotic oxidations catalysed by human cytochrome P450 enzymes. 1. Effects of arachidonic acid, prostaglandins, retinol, retinoic acid and cholecalciferol on xenobiotic oxidations catalysed by 12 recombinant human cytochrome P450 (P450 or CYP) enzymes and by human liver microsomes have been investigated. 2. Arachidonic acid (50 microM) significantly inhibited CYP1A1- and 1A2-dependent 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylations, CYP2C8-dependent taxol 6alpha-hydroxylation and CYP2C19-dependent R-warfarin 7-hydroxylation. This chemical also inhibited slightly the xenobiotic oxidations catalysed by CYP1B1, 2B6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4 in recombinant enzyme systems. 3. Retinol, retinoic acid and cholecalciferol were strong inhibitors for xenobiotic oxidations catalysed by recombinant CYP1A1, 2C8 and 2C19. 4. Dixon plots of inhibitions of CYP1A1-, 1A2-, 2C8- and 2C19-dependent xenobiotic oxidations by arachidonic acid, of CYP1A1-, 2B6- and 2C19-dependent activities by retinol, and of CYP1A1- and 2C19-dependent activities by cholecalciferol indicated that these chemicals inhibit P450 activities mainly through a competitive mechanism. 5. In human liver microsomes, arachidonic acid inhibited CYP1A2-dependent theophylline hydroxylation, CYP2C8-dependent taxol 6alpha-hydroxylation and CYP2C19-dependent omeprazole 5-hydroxylation. Taxol 6alpha-hydroxylation was also inhibited by retinol and retinoic acid, and omeprazole 5-hydroxylation was inhibited by retinol in human liver microsomes. 6. These results suggest that xenobiotic oxidations by P450 enzymes are affected by endobiotic chemicals and that the endobiotic-xenobiotic interactions as well as drug-drug interactions may be of great importance when understanding the basis for pharmacological and toxicological actions of a number of xenobiotic chemicals.
10219970	Disposition of ropinirole in animals and man. 1. The disposition and metabolic fate of ropinirole, a novel compound indicated for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease, was studied in the mouse, rat, cynomolgus monkey and man, following oral and intravenous administration of ropinirole hydrochloride. 2. In all species, nearly all of the p.o. administered dose (94%) was rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract following administration of 14C-ropinirole hydrochloride. In rat and monkey, the compound distributed rapidly beyond total body water and was shown to cross the blood-brain barrier. Blood clearance of the compound was high, approximately equal to one-half the hepatic blood flow in the monkey and similar to the hepatic blood flow in rat. Terminal phase elimination half-lives for the compound were relatively short (0.5 and 1.3 h in rat and monkey respectively), although there was evidence of a second elimination phase in the monkey with an elimination half-life of approximately 5-11 h. Plasma concentrations of ropinirole after the intravenous dose were not determined in the mouse and were below the lower limit of quantification in man (0.08 ng/ml) at the doses used in the studies described in this paper. 3. In both animals and man, ropinirole was extensively metabolized. In the rat, the major metabolic pathway was via hydroxylation of the aromatic ring to form 7-hydroxy ropinirole. In mouse, monkey and man, the major pathway was via N-depropylation. The N-despropyl metabolite was metabolized further to form 7-hydroxy and carboxylic acid derivatives. Metabolites formed in all species were generally metabolized further by glucuronidation. 7-Hydroxy ropinirole is the only metabolite of ropinirole previously shown to possess significant dopamine agonist activity in vivo. In all species, the major route of excretion of ropinirole-related material after oral or intravenous administration of the compound was renal (60-90% of dose).
10223205	Determination of the urinary benzene metabolites S-phenylmercapturic acid and trans,trans-muconic acid by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. To investigate how various levels of exposure affect the metabolic activation pathways of benzene in humans and to examine the relationship between urinary metabolites and other biological markers, we have developed a sensitive and specific liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric assay for simultaneous quantitation of urinary S-phenylmercapturic acid (S-PMA) and trans,trans-muconic acid (t,t-MA). The assay involves spiking urine samples with [13C6]S-PMA and [13C6]t,t-MA as internal standards and clean up of samples by solid-phase extraction with subsequent analysis by liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray-tandem mass spectrometry-selected reaction monitoring (LC-ES-MS/MS-SRM) in the negative ionization mode. The efficacy of this assay was evaluated in human urine specimens from smokers and non-smokers as the benzene-exposed and non-exposed groups. The coefficient of variation of runs on different days (n = 8) for S-PMA was 7% for the sample containing 9.4 microg S-PMA/l urine, that for t,t-MA was 10% for samples containing 0.07 mg t,t-MA/l urine. The mean levels of urinary S-PMA and t,t-MA in smokers were 1.9-fold (P = 0.02) and 2.1-fold (P = 0.03) higher than those in non-smokers. The mean urinary concentration (+/-SE) was 9.1 +/- 1.7 microg S-PMA/g creatinine [median 5.8 microg/g, ranging from not detectable (1 out of 28) to 33.4 microg/g] among smokers. In non-smokers' urine the mean concentration was 4.8 +/- 1.1 microg S-PMA/g creatinine (median 3.6 microg/g, ranging from 1.0 to 19.6 microg/g). For t,t-MA in smokers' urine the mean (+/-SE) was 0.15 +/- 0.03 mg/g creatinine (median 0.11 mg/ g, ranging from 0.005 to 0.34 mg/g); the corresponding mean value for t,t-MA concentration in non-smokers' urine was 0.07 +/- 0.02 mg/g creatinine [median 0.03 mg/g, ranging from undetectable (1 out of 18) to 0.48 mg/g]. There was a correlation between S-PMA and t,t-MA after logarithmic transformation (r = 0.41, P = 0.005, n = 46).
10223723	Augmentation of melanoma-specific gene expression using a tandem melanocyte-specific enhancer results in increased cytotoxicity of the purine nucleoside phosphorylase gene in melanoma. The lineage-specific human tyrosinase promoter has been used to successfully target gene expression at the transcriptional level to melanoma cells. The tyrosinase promoter, alone and in combination with a single, or a dual, tandem melanocyte-specific enhancer, was used to regulate expression of the firefly luciferase reporter gene. Transient transfections of these tissue-specific luciferase constructs in human and murine melanoma (Pmel, B16mel) and colon carcinoma (WiDr, MC38) cell lines resulted in melanoma-specific luciferase expression that was amplified 5- and 500-fold with the addition of a single or double enhancer, respectively, to the tyrosinase promoter. When the double enhancer-promoter construct expressed the highly toxic Escherichia coli purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) gene, transfection of the same cell lines followed by administration of the prodrug 6-methyl purine deoxyriboside (6-MPDR) at a concentration of 50 microM caused melanoma-specific in vitro cell killing. Within 5 days after prodrug administration methylthiazol-tetrazolium (MTT) cytotoxicity assays showed that only 15 and 9% of Pmel and B16mel cells, respectively, remained viable compared with controls. This effect was highly specific, as 90 and 96% of WiDr and MC38 colon carcinoma cells remained viable 5 days after identical treatment. This effect was a direct result of increased tissue-specific conversion of 6-MPDR to the toxic metabolite 6-methylpurine (6-MP), as documented by HPLC analysis of culture supernatants. These results show that the dual tandem melanocyte-specific enhancer provides powerful amplification of the transcriptional targeting of gene expression afforded by use of the tyrosinase promoter. This amplification translates into increased, highly specific cytotoxicity to melanoma by the PNP/6-MPDR enzyme/prodrug system and, therefore, has potential efficacy in the use of gene therapy for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.
10231150	Administration and pharmacokinetics of high-dose cyclophosphamide with hemodialysis support for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in acute leukemia and end-stage renal disease. We report a patient with pre-existing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent successful matched related donor allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for AML in second complete remission (CR2) using conditioning with high-dose cyclophosphamide (CY, 60 mg/kg/day x 2) and TBI (165 cGy twice daily x 4 days). The timing of hemodialysis after high-dose CY was extrapolated from available data on the pharmacokinetics of high-dose CY and hemodialysis clearance of conventional dose CY and its metabolites. Pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that the elimination of high-dose CY and its alkylating metabolites is impaired in ESRD but is cleared with hemodialysis. The patient's early post-transplant course was uncomplicated, and WBC and platelet engraftment occurred by day +22. Bone marrow examination on day +25 showed trilineage engraftment with no AML; cytogenetics showed 100% donor karyotype. The patient remains in remission with 100% donor karyotype at 3 years post transplant. Clinical results indicate that the administration of high-dose CY is feasible with hemodialysis support for patients with ESRD.
10232828	Nitroxide metabolism in the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT. Metabolism of different nitroxides with piperidine structure used as spin labels in electron spin resonance (ESR) studies in vitro and in vivo was investigated in human keratinocytes of the cell line HaCaT by GC and GC-MS technique combined with S-band ESR. Besides the well known reduction of the nitroxyl radicals to the ESR silent hydroxylamines as primary products our results indicate the formation of the corresponding secondary amines. These reductions are inhibited by the thiol blocking agent N-ethylmaleimide and by the strong inhibitors of the thioredoxin reductase (TR) 2-chloro-2,4-nitrobenzene and 2,6-dichloroindophenol. The competitive inhibitor TR inhibitor azelaic acid and the cytochrome P-450 inhibitor metyrapone lack any effects. The rates of reduction to the hydroxylamines and secondary amines were dependent on the lipid solubility of the nitroxides. Therefore, it can be assumed that the nitroxides must enter the cells for their bioreduction. The mostly discussed intracellular nitroxide reducing substances ascorbic acid and glutathione were unable to form the secondary amines. In conclusion, our results suggest that the secondary amine represents one of the major metabolites of nitroxides besides the hydroxylamine inside keratinocytes formed via the flavoenzyme thioredoxin reductase most probably. Further metabolic conversions were detected with 4-oxo-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl and the benzoate of 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl as substrates.
103331	The disposition and metabolism of flurbiprofen in several species including man. Flurbiprofen was rapidly absorbed in all species studied. 2. Half-lives of elimination measured 0 to 12 h after a single dose were: mouse 3.4 h, rat 2.5 h, dog 10.1 h, baboon 3.1 h and man 3.9 h. A second phase of elimination was seen in the dog. Flurbiprofen accumulated in the circulation of the dog on repeated dosing. 3. After dosing with [14C]flurbiprofen, tissue levels of radioactivity in dog and baboon were similar to that in plasma. In the rat, levels were slightly elevated in liver, kidney, large intestine and thyroid after repeated dosing. 4. The dog excreted equal amounts of radioactivity in urine and faeces. In other species renal excretion was the more important route. 5. Six metabolites have been detected, the most important being: 2-(2-fluoro-4'-hydroxy-4-biphenylyl)propionic acid (metabolite 1), 2-(i-fluoro-3',4'-dihydroxy-4-biphenylyl)propionic acid (metabolite 2) and 2-(2-fluoro-3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy-4-biphenylyl)propionic acid (metabolite 3). The proportions of the metabolites and the extents of their conjugation varied among the species. 6. Metabolites were detected in the circulation of rat, mouse and baboon but not in dog and man. 7. Flurbiprofen did not affect the hepatic drug-metabolizing enzyme system of rat. 8. Flurbiprofen was extensively bound to serum protein of rat, dog, baboon and man.
10333318	Assessment of the exposure of children to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) by different methods. 1. In order to elucidate the role of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in various acute and chronic illnesses in children, it is important to assess the degree of exposure by suitable methods. For this purpose, we determined the exposure to ETS in 39 children (4-15 years) and 43 adults (16+ years) by questionnaires, personal diffusion samplers for nicotine, and cotinine measurements in saliva and urine. In addition, the influence of the smoking status and the location of the home (urban or suburban) on the benzene exposure of the children was investigated. 2. On average, the 24 children living in homes with at least one smoker were exposed to ETS for 3.1 h/d. This is significantly longer (P<0.001) than the daily exposure time of the 15 children from nonsmoking homes (0.3 h/d). The nicotine concentrations on the personal samplers worn over 7 days were 0.615 and 0.046 microg/m3 for children from smoking and nonsmoking homes, respectively (P<0.001). Average salivary cotinine levels were 1.95 ng/ml in children from smoking homes and 0.11 ng/ml in children from nonsmoking homes (P< 0.01). The corresponding urinary cotinine levels were 29.4 and 4.5 ng/mg creatinine (P< 0.001). There was no difference in the extent of ETS exposure between children and adults from smoking households. Adults from nonsmoking homes tended to have higher ETS exposure than children from nonsmoking homes. 3. Exposure to benzene, which was determined by means of personal samplers, measurements of benzene in exhaled air and of the urinary benzene metabolite trans, trans-muconic acid, was not significantly related to the smoking status of the home but primarily dependent on the location of the home.
10340724	The pineal and extra-pineal origins of 5-sulphatoxy N-acetyl-serotonin in humans. In humans 6-sulphatoxy melatonin (SaMT) is the principal metabolite of endogenous and exogenous melatonin. 5-sulphatoxy N-acetyl-serotonin (SNAS) is a minor metabolite of exogenous melatonin, but it has not been established whether the levels of endogenous SNAS in plasma derives principally from endogenous melatonin. We have developed the first radioimmunoassay (RIA) for SNAS and used it (together with RIAs for melatonin and SaMT) to determine whether endogenous SNAS derives from endogenous melatonin or from platelet serotonin. Our results show a) the values of endogenous SNAS, unlike endogenous SaMT, increased with blood collection procedures that increased the values of serotonin, b) the values of endogenous SNAS in urine or in platelet-poor plasma were approximately the same as those of endogenous SaMT, but, unlike SaMT, did not show a diurnal rhythm, and c) we confirmed that SNAS was a minor metabolite of orally ingested melatonin. Thus, our conclusion is that SNAS is a minor metabolite of exogenous melatonin, but is not a significant metabolite of endogenous melatonin. In all probability, endogenous SNAS is principally the metabolite of platelet serotonin.
10341740	Oral and dermal absorption of chlorpyrifos: a human volunteer study. To determine the kinetics of elimination of urinary dialkylphosphate metabolites after oral and dermally applied doses of the organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos to human volunteers and to determine whether these doses affected plasma and erythrocyte cholinesterase activity. Five volunteers ingested 1 mg (2852 nmol) of chlorpyrifos. Blood samples were taken over 24 hours and total void volumes of urine were collected over 100 hours. Four weeks later 28.59 mg (81567 nmol) of chlorpyrifos was administered dermally to each volunteer for 8 hours. Unabsorbed chlorpyrifos was washed from the skin and retained for subsequent measurement. The same blood and urine sampling regime was followed as for the oral administration. Plasma and erythrocyte cholinesterase concentrations were determined for each blood sample. The concentration of two urinary metabolites of chlorpyrifos--diethylphosphate and diethyl-thiophosphate--was determined for each urine sample. The apparent elimination half life of urinary dialkylphosphates after the oral dose was 15.5 hours and after the dermal dose it was 30 hours. Most of the oral dose (mean (range) 93% (55-115%)) and 1% of the applied dermal dose was recovered as urinary metabolites. About half (53%) of the dermal dose was recovered from the skin surface. The absorption rate through the skin, as measured by urinary metabolites was 456 ng/cm2/h. Blood plasma and erythrocyte cholinesterase activity did not fall significantly during either dosing regime. An oral dose of chlorpyrifos was readily absorbed through the skin and almost all of the dose was recovered as urinary dialkylphosphate metabolites. Excretion was delayed compared with the oral dose. Only a small proportion of the applied dose was recovered during the course of the experiment. The best time to collect urine samples for biological monitoring after dermal exposure is before the shift the next day. The amounts of chlorpyrifos used did not depress acetyl cholinesterase activity but could be readily detected as urinary dialkylphosphate metabolites indicating that the urinary assay is a more sensitive indicator of exposure.
10344638	Fate of the flavonoid quercetin in human cell lines: chemical instability and metabolism. Although cell cultures are increasingly being used as models for studying the biological actions of flavonoids, no information on the fate, such as uptake and metabolism, exists for these natural products in these models. This study examined the elimination of quercetin, one of the most abundant flavonoids, from the cultured human hepatocarcinoma cell line Hep G2 using [14C]-labelled compound with HPLC and LC/MS for structure characterization. These cells showed a 9.6-fold accumulation of quercetin and the formation of an O-methylated metabolite, isorhamnetin. However, a rapid elimination of quercetin, with no unchanged compound present beyond 8 h, was mainly due to oxidative degradation. The initial intermediate reaction appears to involve peroxidation, leading to a dioxetan, as evidenced by a 32-amu increase in the molecular ion by LC/MS. Subsequently, opening of the C-ring leads to the formation of carboxylic acids, the major one identified in this study as protocatechuic acid. A separate reaction results in a polymeric quercetin product which is highly retained on a reversed-phase C18 HPLC column. It is postulated that these degradative and metabolic changes contribute to the multiple biological actions reported for quercetin, using cell culture models. Interestingly, part of the degradative pathway could be inhibited by including nontoxic concentrations of EDTA in the cell culture medium.
10348176	Determination of ethyl glucuronide, a minor metabolite of ethanol, in human serum by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. A rapid and sensitive determination procedure using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) has been developed for the determination of ethyl glucuronide (EtG) in human serum. Samples were precipitated with methanol, centrifuged and the supernatant was evaporated to dryness followed by reconstitution with distilled water. As mobile phase 30 mM ammonium acetate-acetonitrile (30:70, v/v) was utilized. The base peak observed at m/z 221 was the [M-H]- ion of EtG, which was detectable in satisfactory sense. The detection limit was 0.03 microg/ml in the selected ion monitoring mode. A calibration graph constructed for EtG in serum gave good linearity over the range from 0.1 to 25 microg/ml. This paper also presents the application of this LC-ESI-MS procedure to the analysis of authentic serum samples.
10348180	Excretion study of the beta2-agonist reproterol in human urine. An excretion study of the beta2-agonist 7-[3-[(beta-3,5-trihydroxyphenethyl)amino]-propyl]theophylline (reproterol) in human urine, which is reportedly misused by athletes and horses as a doping agent, is presented. The study was performed after an oral administration of 20 mg of reproterol hydrochloride. The collected urine samples were prepared using the standard anabolic steroid extraction procedure and analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with quadrupole mass spectrometry and, also, with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). The main reproterol metabolite was found, whereas unchanged reproterol was not detected. The structure of the main metabolite was confirmed by an accurate HRMS measurement of diagnostic ions. Finally, an excretion urine profile of the main metabolite is presented. The mass spectrum of another possible unidentified reproterol metabolite is also reported.
10348185	Simultaneous determination of local anesthetics including ester-type anesthetics in human plasma and urine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with solid-phase extraction. The present study describes the simultaneous determination of seven different kinds of local anesthetics and one metabolite by GC-MS with solid-state extraction: Mepivacaine, propitocaine, lidocaine, procaine (an ester-type local anesthetics), cocaine, tetracaine (an ester-type local anesthetics), dibucaine (Dib) and monoethylglycinexylidide (a metabolite of lidocaine) were clearly separated from each other and simultaneously determined by GC-MS using a DB-1 open tubular column. Their recoveries ranged from 73-95% at the target concentrations of 1.00, 10.0 and 100 microg/ml in plasma, urine and water. Coefficients of variation of the recoveries ranged from 2.3-13.1% at these concentrations. The quantitation limits of the method were approximately 100 ng/ml for monoethylglycinexylidide, propitocaine, procaine, cocaine, tetracaine and dibucaine, and 50 ng/ml for lidocaine and mepivacaine. This method was applied to specimens of patients who had been treated with drip infusion of lidocaine, and revealed that simultaneous determination of lidocaine and monoethylglycinexylidide in the blood and urine was possible.
10354960	Nortriptyline E-10-hydroxylation in vitro is mediated by human CYP2D6 (high affinity) and CYP3A4 (low affinity): implications for interactions with enzyme-inducing drugs. The human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms mediating nortriptyline 10-hydroxylation have been identified using kinetic studies on heterologously expressed human CYPs and chemical inhibition studies on human liver microsomes. Nortriptyline was metabolized to E-10-hydroxynortriptyline by human lymphoblast-expressed CYPs 2D6 (Km 2.1 microM) and 3A4 (Km 37.4 microM) with high and low affinity, respectively, whereas CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, and 2E1 had no detectable activity. Human liver microsomal nortriptyline E-10-hydroxylation displayed biphasic kinetics. The high-affinity component (Km 1.3 +/- 0.4 microM, n = 11 livers) was selectively inhibited by the CYP 2D6 inhibitor quinidine, whereas the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole selectively inhibited the low-affinity component (K(m) 24.4 +/- 7 microM, n = 11 livers). Inhibition by ketoconazole increased with increasing substrate concentration, whereas the reverse was true for quinidine. The Vmax of the low-affinity component in human liver microsomes was significantly correlated (r2 = 0.84) with the relative activity factor for CYP3A4, a measure of the amount of catalytically active enzyme. A simulation of the relative contribution of CYPs 2D6 and 3A4 to net nortriptyline hydroxylation rate suggested that the relative contribution of CYP3A4 is only 20% even at the higher end of the therapeutic range. Induction of CYP3A4 will increase its importance and increase the net metabolic rate, whereas inhibition of CYP3A4 will be of little importance due to its minimal relative contribution under uninduced conditions. The identification of CYP3A4 as a low-affinity nortriptyline E-10-hydroxylase explains the ability of poor metabolizers of debrisoquin to hydroxylate nortriptyline, as well as the increased in vivo clearance via this pathway caused by CYP3A4-inducing drugs such as pentobarbital, carbamazepine, and rifampin.
10365640	No pharmacokinetic but pharmacodynamic interactions between cisapride and bromperidol or haloperidol. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between the gastrokinetic drug cisapride and the antipsychotic drugs bromperidol and haloperidol were studied in 29 schizophrenic inpatients. Fourteen patients were taking bromperidol (12-24 mg/d), and 15 were taking haloperidol (12-36 mg/d). Cisapride 10 mg/d was coadministered for 1 week, and blood sampling was performed before cisapride treatment, 1 week after starting cisapride treatment, and I week after stopping cisapride treatment. On the same days as the blood sampling, psychotic symptoms and side effects were evaluated using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Udvalg for Kliniske Undersøgelser (UKU) side effect rating scale (UKU), respectively. Plasma concentrations of bromperidol, haloperidol, and their reduced metabolites were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The mean BPRS scores after adding cisapride were significantly higher than those before cisapride (p<0.01) and after stopping cisapride (p<0.001) in the haloperidol group in this uncontrolled study. A similar tendency was observed in the bromperidol group, although it did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.08). Cisapride coadministration caused no significant changes in the mean plasma concentrations of bromperidol, haloperidol, and their reduced metabolites or in the mean UKU score. The present study suggests that there is no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between cisapride and bromperidol or haloperidol, but cisapride appears to deteriorate psychotic symptoms by a pharmacodynamic interaction in schizophrenic patients treated with haloperidol.
10365644	Determination of buspirone and 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)-piperazine (1-PP) in human plasma by capillary gas chromatography. Two separate gas chromatographic methods for the determination of buspirone and its active metabolite, 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)-piperazine (1-PP) in human plasma are described. Both procedures involve solid-phase extraction (the packing material of the cartridges used was C8 for buspirone and a mixed-mode sorbent for 1-PP), injection of the sample into a gas chromatograph equipped with a fused-silica capillary column and a nitrogen-phosphorus detector, and analysis with temperature programming (from 220 degrees C to 285 degrees C for buspirone and from 138 degrees C to 285 degrees C for 1-PP). The coating material of the analytical column was 5% diphenyl dimethyl silicone for buspirone and 50% diphenyl dimethyl silicone for 1-PP. Zolpidem was used as an internal standard in the buspirone assay and 1-phenylpiperazine in the 1-PP assay. Recovery of buspirone and 1-PP averaged 98% and 89%, respectively, and the limit of quantification was 0.2 ng/mL for both compounds. The between-run coefficients of variation ranged from 3.2% to 9.4% and from 2.9% to 8.6% for samples spiked with three different concentrations of buspirone and 1-PP, respectively. The suitability of these assays for pharmacokinetic studies was shown by analyzing timed plasma samples from volunteers after ingestion of a single therapeutic dose of buspirone (10 mg).
10369322	Nail analysis for drugs of abuse: extraction and determination of cannabis in fingernails by RIA and GC-MS. Fingernail clippings were evaluated as analytical specimens for the detection and quantitation of cannabinoids. Specimens were obtained from consenting adults attending a drug clinic, along with information concerning the drugs which they had used over the previous six months. Methods for the surface decontamination and extraction of the specimens were evaluated. Detergent, water, and methanol washes followed by alkaline hydrolysis and liquid-liquid extraction were selected for use in the study. Extracts were analyzed by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to detect and quantitate cannabinoids present in fingernail clippings. Positive RIA results were obtained from specimens from six known cannabis users. The mean cannabinoid concentration in fingernail clippings determined by RIA was 1.03 ng/mg. Using GC-MS, the mean delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol concentration in fingernail clippings from a further 14 known cannabis users was 1.44 ng/mg. Using GC-MS, the average 11-nor-delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid concentration in fingernail clippings from three known cannabis users extracted in acidic pH was 19.85 ng/mg. Based on these results, fingernails are potentially useful biological specimens for the detection of past cannabis use in cases of medicolegal interest.
10369328	Amphetamine and fenproporex levels following multidose administration of fenproporex. Drugs that are metabolized to amphetamine or methamphetamine are potentially of significant concern in the interpretation of positive drug-testing results for amphetamines. A number of different drugs have been reported to produce amphetamine in the urine of users. One of these compounds, fenproporex, has been shown to be metabolized to amphetamine, and previous reports indicated the parent compound could be detected at low levels for up to 48 h. Administration of fenproporex for seven days (one 10-mg dose per day) to five healthy volunteers resulted in amphetamine being detected in the urine of all subjects. Peak concentrations of amphetamine ranged from approximately 2850 to 4150 ng/mL. Amphetamine could be detected (> or = 5 ng/mL) in the urine for up to nearly 170 h after the last dose. Analysis of the metabolically produced amphetamine showed the presence of both enantiomers, which can be helpful in the differentiation of some illicit amphetamine use from the use of this precursor drug. In addition, evaluation of the enantiomeric composition of the metabolite (amphetamine) can be a valuable tool in the interpretation of time since last dose. More significantly, all samples that contained amphetamine at a concentration of > or = 500 ng/mL were shown to also contain detectable amounts of the parent compound.
10375008	Preclinical and in vitro assessment of the potential of D0870, an antifungal agent, for producing clinical drug interactions. 1. D0870, an azole antifungal agent, produced dose-related increases in total cytochrome P450 and aldrin epoxidase when administered as 14 daily oral doses (0, 0.5, 2.5 and 12.5 mg/kg/day) to the male rat. Administered as single doses, D0870 increased pentobarbitone-sleeping time in a dose-related manner. 2. In human hepatic microsomal incubations, D0870 produced pronounced inhibition of CYP2C9 (tolbutamide hydroxylase) and, to a lesser degree, CYP3A4 (testosterone 6beta-hydroxylase), but had more limited effects on CYP1A2, 2C19 and 2D6 activity. In comparison with ketoconazole, itraconazole and fluconazole, D0870 was the most potent inhibitor of CYP2C9 activity. It is predicted that D0870 may inhibit the in vivo clearance of CYP2C9 substrates by approximately 58%, thereby increasing their steady-state concentrations by 2.4 times, which would be of clinical significance for some compounds. 3. During incubation of [14C]-D0870 with cultured human hepatocytes for up to 72 h, two discrete metabolites (A and B) were formed. Formation of metabolite A was abolished by both quinidine and ketoconazole and is probably CYP3A4-mediated, whereas generation of metabolite B did not appear to be dependent on cytochrome P450. 4. D0870 has potential to produce both induction and inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes in man.
10399883	In vitro evaluation of aromatase enzyme in granulosa cells using a [11C]vorozole binding assay. An in vitro method for measuring aromatase cytochrome P450 enzyme (P450AROM) in human granulosa cells (GC) has been developed, based on binding of the 11C-labeled aromatase inhibitor vorozole. GC were obtained following superstimulation during in vitro fertilisation. The method revealed a binding affinity (Kd) of 0.4 nM and a maximum binding (Bmax) at 11 fmol/4000 cells which is equal to 1.6 million binding sites per cell. Linear Scatchard plots indicated a single type of binding site. P450AROM concentrations measured by [11C]vorozole binding correlated positively with aromatisation of [1beta-3H]androst-4-ene-3,17-dione measured as [3H]water release, and a positive association was also found with the ovarian in vivo response to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulation expressed as 1000 times the ratio of the number of oocytes recovered from a patient and the total dose of recombinant FSH administered. Frozen cells could be used for P450AROM quantitation, provided the correct freezing procedure was used. Quantitation of P450AROM, based on binding of [11C]vorozole is an accurate and sensitive in vitro method, which might be extended to the measurement of aromatase expression by a noninvasive technique in the intact ovary in vivo using positron emission tomography.
10403533	Doxazosin treatment and peroxidation of low-density lipoprotein among male hypertensive subjects: in vitro and ex vivo studies. Doxazosin is an antihypertensive drug that gives rise to 6- and 7-hydroxydoxazosin during hepatic metabolism. The structures of the hydroxymetabolites suggest that they may possess antioxidative properties. The aim of the present study was to examine whether doxazosin and 6- and 7-hydroxydoxazosin were able to scavenge free radicals and whether these compounds might protect low-density lipoprotein (LDL) against in vitro and ex vivo oxidation. Both 6- and 7-hydroxydoxazosin showed radical scavenging capacity as assessed by measuring scavenging of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radicals. In vitro incubation with 10 microM 6- and 7-hydroxydoxazosin significantly reduced human mononuclear cell-mediated oxidation of LDL, measured as the formation of lipid peroxides and the relative electrophoretic mobility of LDL (to 10 and 6% of the control, respectively). Furthermore, formation of conjugated dienes in LDL during Cu2+-induced oxidation was significantly reduced in the presence of 5 microM 6- and 7-hydroxydoxazosin (to 28% of tmax [time to maximum] of control). However, treatment of hypertensive patients with increasing doses of doxazosin (from 1 to 8 mg/day) for 8 weeks altered neither Cu2+-catalyzed, 2,2'azobis-(2-amidinopropane hydrochloride)-initiated, nor cell-mediated oxidation of patient LDL ex vivo. Furthermore, the total antioxidative capacity of plasma was unaffected by treatment. In conclusion, the present study shows that 6- and 7-hydroxydoxazosin have radical scavenging properties and protect LDL against in vitro oxidation. However, treatment of hypertensive male subjects with increasing doses of doxazosin for 8 weeks did not affect ex vivo oxidation of LDL.
10404632	Testing for anabolic steroids in hair from two bodybuilders. Two male bodybuilders were recently arrested by the French customs in Strasbourg (France) in possession of 2050 tablets and 251 ampoules of various anabolic steroids. It was claimed that the steroids were for personal use and not for trafficing as suggested by the police. Urine and hair specimens were collected from both suspects to clarify the claims. Nandrolone, stanozolol, testosterone and their corresponding metabolites were identified in the urine of both subjects. After decontamination, the hair was hydrolyzed by sodium hydroxide in presence of deuterated internal standards. After extraction with ethyl acetate and silylation, the drugs were identified by GC-MS in the electron impact mode. Hair from both males were positive for nandrolone (196 and 260 pg/mg), testosterone (46 and 71 pg/mg) and stanozolol (135 and 156 pg/mg), clearly indicating steroids abuse. Although not yet recognized by the International Olympic Committee, hair analysis may be a useful adjunct to conventional drug testing in urine from athletes.
10406210	Simultaneous quantitative determination of cilostazol and its metabolites in human plasma by high-performance liquid chromatography. A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for the simultaneous determination of cilostazol, a quinolinone derivative, and its known metabolites OPC-13015, OPC-13213, OPC-13217, OPC-13366, OPC-13269, OPC-13326 and OPC-13388 in human plasma was developed and validated. Cilostazol, its metabolites and two internal standards, OPC-3930 and OPC-13112, were extracted from human plasma by a combination of liquid-liquid and liquid-solid phase extractions, with combined organic solvents of n-butanol, methanol, chloroform, methyl-tert.-butyl ether, and a Sep-Pak silica column. The combined extract was then evaporated and the residue was reconstituted in ammonium acetate buffer (pH 6.5). The reconstituted solution was injected onto a HPLC system and was subjected to reversed-phase HPLC on a 5 microm ODS-80TM column to obtain quality chromatograph and good peak resolution. A gradient mobile phase with different percentages of acetonitrile in acetate buffer (pH 6.5) was used for the resolution of analytes. Cilostazol, its metabolites and the two internal standards were well separated at baseline from each other with resolution factor being 74 and 138. This HPLC method was demonstrated to be specific for all analytes of interest with no significant interference from the endogenous substances of human plasma. The lower limit of quantitation was 20 ng/ml for cilostazol and all metabolites. The method was validated initially for an extended linear range of 20-600 ng/ml for all metabolites and cilostazol, and has been revised later for a linear range of 20-1200 ng/ml for cilostazol and two major and active metabolites OPC-13015 and OPC-13213. The overall accuracy (relative recovery) of this method was established to be 98.5% to 104.9% for analytes with overall precision (CV) being 1.5% to 9.0%. The long-term stability of clinical plasma samples was established for at least one year at -20 degrees C. Two internal standards of OPC-3930 and OPC-13112 were evaluated and validated. However, the data indicated that there was no significant difference for all accuracy and precision obtained by using either OPC-3930 or OPC-13112. OPC-3930 was chosen as the internal standard for the analysis of plasma samples from clinical studies due to its shorter retention time. During the validation standard curves had correlation coefficients greater than or equal to 0.998 for cilostazol and the seven metabolites. These data clearly demonstrate the reliability and reproducibility of the method.
10408839	CPT-11 converting carboxylesterase and topoisomerase activities in tumour and normal colon and liver tissues. CPT-11 is a prodrug activated by carboxylesterases to the active metabolite SN-38 which is a potent inhibitor of topoisomerase I. CPT-11 is of clinical interest in the treatment of colorectal cancer. We evaluated the activities of CPT-11 converting carboxylesterase (CPT-CE) and topoisomerase I (topo I) in 53 colorectal tumours, in eight liver metastases and in normal tissue adjacent to the tumours. Both CPT-CE and topo I activities were widely variable in the malignant and the normal tissue of patients with colorectal carcinomas. CPT-CE was only two to threefold lower in primary tumours compared to normal liver, suggesting that a local conversion to SN-38 might occur in tumour cells. CPT-CE was similar in liver and in normal colon tissues. Levels of topo I in tumour ranged from 580 to 84 900 U mg protein(-1) and was above 40 000 U mg protein(-1) in 11 of 53 patients. Similarly, a very high ratio (> 5) between tumour and normal tissues were observed in 12 of 53 patients. An inverse correlation was observed between the topo I activity and the clinical stage of disease. Clinical studies are in progress in our institution to explore a possible relationship between CPT-CE and topo I activities in tumour cells and the response to CPT-11-based chemotherapy in patients with colorectal cancer.
10410955	Determination of cyclophosphamide and its metabolites in human plasma by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. A sensitive HPLC-MS method was developed for the simultaneous determination of cyclophosphamide and its metabolites 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide (aldocyclophosphamide), 4-ketocyclophosphamide, caboxyphosphamide and 3-dechloroethylifosfamide in human plasma. 4-Hydroxycyclophosphamide was converted with methylhydroxylamine to the stable methyloxime form. We used a solid-phase extraction with C18 cartridges followed by HPLC-MS with the single mass spectrometer SSQ 7000 of Finnigan. The limits of detection were 15 ng/ml for cyclophosphamide, 3-dechloroethylifosfamide and ketocyclophosphamide in each case and 30 ng/ml for carboxyphosphamide and 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide, respectively. First results of pharmacokinetics are shown.
10414794	The role of metabolism in determining susceptibility to parathion toxicity in man. Human liver microsomes (n = 16) activated parathion (O, O, diethyl O-p-nitrophenyl phosphorothioate, 20 and 200 microM) to paraoxon at a rate of 23.3-199.3 and 18.7-310.3 pmol/min per mg protein, respectively. p-Nitrophenol, was also formed, at 321.1-769.2 and 406.2-778.3 pmol/min per mg protein. This represented a 16-fold and 2-fold range in capacity to activate and detoxify parathion, respectively. Parathion was activated with an apparent Km of 9-16 microM (n = 3). The activation of parathion (200 microM) was positively correlated with nifedipine oxidation, indicating the involvement of CYP3A. Correlations were not significant with ethoxyresorufin-O-dealkylation (CYP1A1/2), pentoxyresorufin-O-dealkylation (CYP2B6), p-nitrophenol hydroxylation (CYP2E1), paraoxon hydrolysis (A-esterase) or phenylvalerate hydrolysis (B-esterase). Paraoxon formation from parathion was markedly reduced by CYP3A inhibitors. Experiments with EDTA indicated that A-esterase was not functionally important at low levels of paraoxon. Human P450s 3A4 and 3A5 expressed microsomes were the most efficient at biotransforming parathion to paraoxon, although P450s 1A1, 2B6 and 2C8 also catalysed the reaction. This study has determined wide interindividual variations in capacity to metabolise parathion, mainly by CYP3A, which may influence its manifest toxicity.
10424321	Inhibition of thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity by impurities in commercially available substrates: a factor for differing results of TPMT measurements. Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) activity, when measured in red blood cells (RBC) with a recently published TPMT activity assay using 6-thioguanine (6-TG) as substrate, could not be reproduced in another laboratory. We investigated factors which could influence the results of the TPMT activity measurement. We tested twelve 6-TG and four 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) compounds from different suppliers as substrates and determined the enzyme kinetic parameters Km and Vmax. Furthermore, we studied the influence of different 6-TG compounds on the affinity of the methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to the TPMT enzyme. All 6-TG products were of equal purity (declared >98% by the supplier): this was ascertained by HPLC. However, the rate of methylation obtained following incubation with 6-TG from different suppliers ranged from 10% to 100% when incubated with the same RBC lysate. The lowest apparent Km value for a 6-TG was 22.3 micromol x l(-1), while the product with the highest methylation rate showed a Km of 156 micromol x l(-1). From these results we assume that there is a contaminant in some 6-TG products, which acts as a strong inhibitor of TPMT activity. Compounds possibly used for the synthesis of 6-TG (guanine, pyridine, 6-chloroguanine) did not affect the methylation rate. Thioxanthine, which is known to be a strong inhibitor of TPMT when added to the assay system to give a 2% contamination, reduced TPMT activity from 100% to 72%. Using 6-MP from different suppliers as substrate resulted in Km values ranging from 110 to 162 micromol x l(-1) and Vmox values ranging from 54 to 68 nmol 6-MMP x g(-1)Hb x h(-1). The Km value for the methyl donor SAM was similar to and independent from the thiopurine substrates tested (range 4.9-11 micromol-l(-1) SAM). In contrast to other investigators, we found non-enzymatic S-methylation, which was negligible under our assay conditions (3% with 128 micromol x l(-1) SAM), but could become relevant in experiments using higher SAM concentrations. TPMT enzyme activity determined with 6-TG as substrate may be strongly inhibited by a contaminant in some of the 6-TG lots distributed.
10429839	The low potential for drug interactions with zanamivir. The objective of this study was to assess the potential of zanamivir, a specific inhibitor of influenza A and B virus neuraminidase, to interact with other coadministered therapies in the clinical setting. Potential interactions with zanamivir were examined in a series of in vitro and in vivo model systems. The expression of microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes was examined after daily treatment of rats with intravenous zanamivir. The ability of zanamivir to inhibit the metabolism of CYP probe substrates was studied in human liver microsomes. The binding of zanamivir to human and animal red blood cell fractions and plasma proteins was measured. Finally, the effect of commonly coadministered drugs on the ability of zanamivir to inhibit viral replication in vitro was tested. Zanamivir had no effect on the expression of microsomal CYP isoenzymes after daily intravenous treatment of rats with zanamivir 1, 9 or 90 mg/kg for 5 weeks. Zanamivir at concentrations up to 500 mumol/L (150 mg/L) had no effect on the metabolism of the CYP probe substrates bufuralol, chlorzoxazone, coumarin, ethoxyresorufin, mephenytoin, midazolam, phenacetin and tolbutamide by human liver microsomes. The binding of zanamivir 0.05 to 10 mg/L to human, dog and rat red blood cells and plasma proteins was low. The in vitro potency of zanamivir against influenza virus in Madin Darby canine kidney cells was not adversely affected by aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) 1.2 mmol/L, paracetamol (acetaminophen) 6.6 mmol/L, ibuprofen 243 mumol/L, phenylephrine 6 mmol/L, oxymetazoline 380 mumol/L, promethazine 35 mumol/L and co-amoxiclav (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid) 1.66 mmol/L. These data suggest the following: (i) there is no theoretical basis for expecting metabolic interactions between zanamivir and other coadministered compounds; (ii) zanamivir is unlikely to interact with coadministered compounds that are protein bound; and (iii) commonly coadministered drugs will not interfere with the antiviral activity of zanamivir in vivo. Although none of these in vitro or in vivo studies were exhaustive, and although none were performed in humans, all the data are consistent with zanamivir having a very low potential for interactions with coadministered drugs in the clinical setting.
10437670	Simultaneous determination of the urinary metabolites of toluene, xylene and styrene using high-performance capillary electrophoresis. Comparison with high-performance liquid chromatography. A simple and rapid method using high-performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE) for the simultaneous determination of the urinary metabolites of toluene, xylene and styrene, plus creatinine and uric acid in human urine specimens and standard solutions is described. The compounds were well separated from each other on a fused-silica capillary utilizing a 20 mM sodium tetraborate buffer (pH 9.65) with 15 mM beta-cyclodextrin and UV detection at 200 and 225 nm. The total analysis time was less than 6 min per sample. The capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) method shows a good correlation with the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with respect to urinary hippuric acid concentrations in the urine specimens of subjects exposed to the vapors of a solvent mixture of toluene and xylene. In comparing these two techniques, HPCE was found to be superior to HPLC because the analysis time is shorter, and the separation of m-MHA and p-MHA takes a long time with HPLC.
10440465	Detection of the novel metabolite ethylphenidate after methylphenidate overdose with alcohol coingestion. Methylphenidate is the most commonly prescribed psychostimulant in clinical use today. Known methylphenidate metabolites include ritalinic acid, corresponding lactams, and p-hydroxymethylphenidate. Recent in vitro work using rat liver preparations has indicated that the methylphenidate ethyl ester, ethylphenidate, is formed upon incubation with ethanol. This report describes the first detection of ethylphenidate in human blood and liver samples obtained from two suicide victims who had overdosed on methylphenidate and coingested ethanol. Amounts of ethylphenidate detected in whole blood specimens in these two cases (8 ng/mL and 1 ng/mL, respectively) were small relative to methylphenidate and ritalinic acid concentrations. Nonetheless, given the high likelihood that methylphenidate and ethanol coingestion frequently occurs, the detection of ethylphenidate in humans warrants further investigation into the extent of its formation as well as into any associated toxicity in nonoverdose situations.
10445490	Determination of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine in urine and hair by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Buprenorphine, which is used in France as a substitution drug for opioid addiction, is widely abused, and several fatal cases have been reported. In order to confirm a recent intoxication or to establish retrospectively chronic abuse, a simple and reliable gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric method was developed and validated for quantitation of buprenorphine and its active metabolite norbuprenorphine in urine and hair. Two milliliters of urine or 50 mg of pulverized hair was submitted to a pretreatment (enzymatic hydrolysis for urine and decontamination with dichloromethane followed by incubation in 0.1 M HCI for hair). Buprenorphine-d4 was chosen as the internal standard. Selective solid-phase extraction with Bond Elut Certify columns provided recoveries higher than 85% for urine and 43% for hair. By using a mixture of MSTFA/TMSIM/TMCS (100:2:5), buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine produced stable silylated derivatives. The detection was carried out with a quadrupole mass detector working in El selected ion monitoring mode. Ions at m/z 450 and 468 were chosen for the quantitation of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine, respectively (m/z 454 was used for the internal standard). Limits of quantitation were 0.25 and 0.20 ng/mL, respectively, for buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine in urine and 0.005 ng/mg for the two compounds in hair. Calibration curves were linear from 0 to 50 ng/mL in urine and from 0 to 0.4 ng/mg in hair. Between-day and within-day precisions were less than 8.4% in hair and 6.1% in urine for both molecules in all cases. This method was applied to urine and hair samples collected from patients in a withdrawal treatment program and demonstrated its good applicability in routine analysis and its benefit for clinicians. This technique, which requires instruments already available to many toxicology laboratories, offers an attractive alternative to more sophisticated techniques.
10456490	Grapefruit juice has no effect on quinine pharmacokinetics. As quinine is mainly metabolised by human liver CYP3A4 and grapefruit juice inhibits CYP3A4, the effect of grapefruit juice on the pharmacokinetics of quinine following a single oral dose of 600 mg quinine sulphate was investigated. The study was carried out in ten healthy volunteers using a randomised cross-over design. Subjects were studied on three occasions, with a washout period of 2 weeks. During each period, subjects received a pretreatment of 200 ml orange juice (control), full-strength grapefruit juice or half-strength grapefruit juice twice daily for 5 days. On day 6, the subjects were given a single oral dose of 600 mg quinine sulphate with 200 ml of one of the juices. Plasma and urine samples for measurement of quinine and its major metabolite, 3-hydroxyquinine, were collected over a 48-h period and analysed by means of a high-performance liquid chromatography method. The intake of grapefruit juice did not significantly alter the oral pharmacokinetics of quinine. There were no significant differences among the three treatment periods with regard to pharmacokinetic parameters of quinine, including the peak plasma drug concentration (Cmax), the time to reach Cmax (tmax), the terminal elimination half-life (t1/2), the area under the concentration-time curve and the apparent oral clearance. The pharmacokinetics of the 3-hydroxyquinine metabolite were slightly changed when volunteers received grapefruit juice. The mean Cmax of the metabolite (0.25+/-0.09 mg l(-1), mean +/- SD) while subjects received full-strength grapefruit juice was significantly less than during the control period (0.31+/-0.06 mg l(-1), P < 0.05) and during the intake of half-strength grapefruit juice (0.31+/-0.07 mg l(-1), P < 0.05). These results suggest that there is no significant interaction between the parent compound quinine and grapefruit juice, so it is not necessary to advise patients against ingesting grapefruit juice at the same time that they take quinine. Since quinine is a low clearance drug with a relatively high oral bioavailability, and is primarily metabolised by human liver CYP3A4, the lack of effect of grapefruit juice on quinine pharmacokinetics supports the view that the site of CYP inhibition by grapefruit juice is mainly in the gut.
10456690	Involvement of CYP2D6 in the in vitro metabolism of amphetamine, two N-alkylamphetamines and their 4-methoxylated derivatives. 1. Amphetamine (AM) and five amphetamine derivatives, N-ethylamphetamine (NEA), N-butylamphetamine (NBA), 4-methoxyamphetamine (M-AM), 4-methoxy-N-ethylamphetamine (M-NEA) and 4-methoxy-N-butylamphetamine (M-NBA) were incubated with microsomal preparations from cells expressing human CYP2D6 to determine whether the enzyme was capable of catalyzing the direct ring oxidation of all substrates; the N-dealkylation of NEA, NBA, M-NEA and M-NBA; and the O-demethylation of M-AM, M-NEA and M-NBA. 2. None of the six compounds examined was N-dealkylated to any extent. 3. The only metabolites produced from AM, NEA and NBA were the corresponding ring 4-hydroxylated compounds, and the rates of formation were low. 4. All ring 4-methoxylated substrates were efficiently O-demethylated by CYP2D6 to their corresponding phenols. The size of the N-alkyl group influenced the rates of formation of these phenolamines. In contrast to reported findings with 2- and 3-methoxyamphetamines, none of the 4-methoxyamphetamines was ring-oxidized in the CYP2D6 enzyme system to 2- or 3-hydroxy-4-methoxyamphetamines or to dihydroxyamphetamines.
10460069	Clomipramine dose-effect study in patients with depression: clinical end points and pharmacokinetics. Danish University Antidepressant Group (DUAG). To examine the problems of establishing dose-effect and concentration-effect relationships of antidepressant therapy with clomipramine. This randomized double-blind study compared five fixed doses of clomipramine hydrochloride: 25, 50, 75, 125, and 200 mg/day in hospitalized or day patients at nine clinical centers in Denmark. A 1-week washout period was followed by 6 weeks of active treatment and weekly depression ratings. In total, 151 patients (100 women and 51 men) with major depression scoring > or =18 on the Hamilton Depression Scale (HDS) or > or =9 on the Hamilton Depression subscale (HDSS) before and after the washout period were randomized. The treatment groups (n = 29 to 32) were well balanced with respect to sex, age, and depression rating. Serum concentrations of clomipramine plus metabolites were measured at weekly intervals. A sparteine test was performed before and during drug treatment. There was pronounced interpatient variability in response and kinetics at each dose. Drop-outs attributable to adverse events increased with rising doses, whereas drop-outs caused by worsening or lack of effect or nonresponse declined with increasing dose. Completer analyses showed a moderate and statistically significant relationship between depression rating and dose at all ratings after 1 to 6 weeks of treatment (trend analysis). HDS items representing core symptoms of depression showed a particularly consistent dose-effect relationship. Early sustained response occurred more frequently with the two highest doses. Serum levels of clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine showed weak correlation with depression ratings (Rs = -0.18 to -0.27; P < .05 to P < .01). A few blood pressure measurements and a few typical side-effect ratings showed a statistically significant dose-effect and concentration-effect relationship. Serum concentration of clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine showed a pronounced disproportionate increase with increasing dose. Clomipramine inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion CYP2D6 (sparteine oxidation). The dose-effect curves, indicating the probability of a certain outcome at a given dose, were flat and overlapping suggesting a narrow therapeutic range. This pattern is similar to that observed with newer antidepressants.
10468218	Peripheral markers of oxidative stress in Parkinson's disease. The role of L-DOPA. Oxidative stress plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). L-DOPA, the gold standard in PD therapy, may paradoxically contribute to the progression of the disease because of its pro-oxidant properties. The issue, however, is controversial. In this study, we evaluated peripheral markers of oxidative stress in normal subjects, untreated PD patients and PD patients treated only with L-DOPA. We also measured platelet and plasma levels of L-DOPA, 3-O-methyldopa (the long-lasting metabolite of the drug), and dopamine. We found that isolated platelets of treated PD patients form higher amounts of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate, an index of hydroxyl radical generation, than platelets of controls or untreated patients. In treated patients, platelet levels of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate were positively correlated with platelet levels of L-DOPA, 3-O-methyldopa, and with the score of disease severity. Disease severity was correlated with platelet and plasma levels of L-DOPA, as well as with the daily intake of the drug. No significant differences in platelet levels of cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase were found between PD patients, either treated or untreated, and controls. Our findings lend further support to the hypothesis that L-DOPA might promote free radical formation in PD patients.
10472315	Role of individual susceptibility in risk assessment of pesticides. This study presents criteria for assessing the individual pesticide burden of workers in the chemical industry. A group of 1003 workers exposed to methylparathion or ethylparathion (alkyl phosphates), propoxur (carbamate), or cyfluthrin (pyrethroid) was investigated. After exposure to methylparathion or ethylparathion the methylparathion or ethylparathion and methylparaoxon or ethylparaoxon concentrations in plasma, the p-nitrophenol concentration in urine, and the activities of cholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase were measured. For exposure to propoxur the propoxur concentration in plasma, the 2-isopropoxyphenol concentration in urine, and the cholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase activities were measured. For exposure to cyfluthrin the cyfluthrin concentration in plasma was measured. At the same propoxur concentration only workers with a low individual acetylcholinesterase activity reported symptoms. Workers who metabolised cyfluthrin rapidly reported less symptoms than workers with a lower rate of metabolism. This tendency was also evident in cases of mixed exposure (cyfluthrin and methylparathion). In the assessment of exposure to pesticides susceptibility of the individual person has to be considered.
10492058	Effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of quinidine. To investigate the possible involvement of cytochromes CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 in the in vivo oxidative metabolism of quinidine. This was an open study of six healthy young male volunteers. The pharmacokinetics of a 200-mg single oral dose of quinidine were studied before and during daily treatment with 100 mg fluvoxamine. Biomarkers of other isozyme activities in the form of caffeine, sparteine, mephenytoin, tolbutamide and cortisol metabolism were applied. The results showed a statistically significant median reduction of 2944% in the quinidine total apparent oral clearance, partial clearances by 3-hydroxylation and N-oxidation and residual clearance during fluvoxamine treatment. Renal clearance was unaffected by fluvoxamine. The effect of fluvoxamine on the formation clearances of 3-hydroxyquinidine and quinidine-N-oxide most likely reflects inhibition of cytochrome P4503A4 by fluvoxamine at clinically relevant doses. The results of this study do not rule out a possible involvement of CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 in the in vivo oxidative metabolism of quinidine.
10503898	Detoxification of carcinogenic aromatic and heterocyclic amines by enzymatic reduction of the N-hydroxy derivative. The metabolic activation pathways associated with carcinogenic aromatic and heterocyclic amines have long been known to involve N-oxidation, catalyzed primarily by cytochrome P4501A2, and subsequent O-esterification, often catalyzed by acetyltransferases (NATs) and sulfotransferases (SULTs). We have found a new enzymatic mechanism of carcinogen detoxification: a microsomal NADH-dependent reductase that rapidly converts the N-hydroxy arylamine back to the parent amine. The following N-OH-arylamines and N-OH-heterocyclic amines were rapidly reduced by both human and rat liver microsomes: NOH-4-aminoazobenzene, N-OH-4-aminobiphenyl (N-OH-ABP), N-OH-aniline, N-OH-2-naphthylamine, N-OH-2-aminofluorene, N-OH-4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) (N-OH-MOCA), N-OH-1-naphthyamine, N-OH-2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (N-OH-PhIP), N-OH-2-amino-alpha-carboline (N-OH-AalphaC), N-OH-2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (N-OH-MeIQx), and N-OH-2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (N-OH-IQ). In addition, primary rat hepatocytes and human HepG2 cells efficiently reduced N-OH-PhIP to PhIP. This previously unrecognized detoxification pathway may limit the bioavailability of carcinogenic N-OH heterocyclic and aromatic amines for further activation, DNA adduct formation, and carcinogenesis.
10510156	Characterization of the cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the in vitro metabolism of rosiglitazone. To identify the human cytochrome P450 enzyme(s) involved in the in vitro metabolism of rosiglitazone, a potential oral antidiabetic agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes-mellitus. Method The specific P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of rosiglitazone were determined by a combination of three approaches; multiple regression analysis of the rates of metabolism of rosiglitazone in human liver microsomes against selective P450 substrates, the effect of selective chemical inhibitors on rosiglitazone metabolism and the capability of expressed P450 enzymes to mediate the major metabolic routes of rosiglitazone metabolism. Result The major products of metabolism following incubation of rosiglitazone with human liver microsomes were para-hydroxy and N-desmethyl rosiglitazone. The rate of formation varied over 38-fold in the 47 human livers investigated and correlated with paclitaxel 6alpha-hydroxylation (P<0.001). Formation of these metabolites was inhibited significantly (>50%) by 13-cis retinoic acid, a CYP2C8 inhibitor, but not by furafylline, quinidine or ketoconazole. In addition, both metabolites were produced by microsomes derived from a cell line transfected with human CYP2C8 cDNA. There was some evidence for CYP2C9 playing a minor role in the metabolism of rosiglitazone. Sulphaphenazole caused limited inhibition (<30%) of both pathways in human liver microsomes and microsomes from cells transfected with CYP2C9 cDNA were able to mediate the metabolism of rosiglitazone, in particular the N-demethylation pathway, albeit at a much slower rate than CYP2C8. Rosiglitazone caused moderate inhibition of paclitaxel 6alpha-hydroxylase activity (CYP2C8; IC50=18 microm ), weak inhibition of tolbutamide hydroxylase activity (CYP2C9; IC50=50 microm ), but caused no marked inhibition of the other cytochrome P450 activities investigated (CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A and 4A). Conclusion CYP2C8 is primarily responsible for the hydroxylation and N-demethylation of rosiglitazone in human liver; with minor contributions from CYP2C9.
10510747	Characterization of lidocaine metabolism by rat nasal microsomes: implications for nasal drug delivery. Lidocaine has been recently approved for use as an intranasal spray in the treatment of migraine. In this study, we investigated the metabolism of lidocaine to its primary metabolite monoethylglycine xylidide (MEGX), by rat nasal olfactory and respiratory microsomes. The metabolic parameters were compared with metabolism employing rat and human hepatic microsomes. The olfactory and respiratory microsomes both exhibited considerable activity for conversion of lidocaine to MEGX in comparison with the activity in the hepatic tissues. The rat olfactory microsomes had a markedly higher affinity than the rat hepatic or respiratory microsomes. However, the turnover rate was only about one-half that of rat liver. Employing Western immunoblotting we investigated the presence of cytochrome P450s (CYPs) 1A2, 3A2, 2B1 and 2C11 in rat nasal tissues; these isozymes are known to partcipated in the metabolism of lidocaine in rat liver. These isozymes were found to be present in significant amounts in both the nasal olfactory and respiratory tissue; this is the first known report of the presence of CYP2C11 in nasal mucosae. Our studies underscore the importance of CYP-mediated drug metabolism in nasal tissues. The effect of this 'nasal first-pass' should be weighed carefully while considering the fate and the bioavailability of drugs delivered via the intranasal route.
10510769	On-line coupling of automated solid-phase extraction with high-performance liquid chromatography and electrochemical detection. Quantitation of oxidizable drugs of abuse and their metabolites in plasma and urine. The concentration effect of automated on-line solid-phase extraction (SPE) in combination with HPLC and very sensitive electrochemical detection was employed for the determination of N-ethyl-4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-amphetamine (HMEA, the main metabolite of the ecstasy analogue MDE), delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and 11-nor-delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol-carboxylic acid (THC-COOH) in plasma and urine in comparison to a previously published psilocin assay. For the SPE either CBA (functional group: carboxypropyl)- or CH (functional group: cyclohexyl)-sorbent was used. The following separation was carried out on a reversed-phase column (LiChroCart, Superspher 60 RP select B from Merck). Depending on the hydrodynamic voltammogram of the analyzed substance the oxidation potential varied from 920 mV up to 1.2 V. In spite of using high potentials, precision and accuracy were always within the accepted statistical requirements. The limits of quantitation were between 5 ng/ml (THC, THC-COOH in plasma) and 20 ng/ml (HMEA in plasma). Advantages of on-line SPE in comparison with off-line methods were less manual effort, evidently smaller volumes (< or = 400 microliters) of plasma or urine and almost always higher recovery rates (> 93%). The assays have been successfully proven with real biological samples and found suitable for use in routine analysis.
10511268	Biomarkers of dose and susceptibility in cyclists exposed to monoaromatic hydrocarbons. A quasi-experimental field study was carried out in 24 volunteers with the aim of: (i) assessing personal exposure to aromatic hydrocarbons polluting urban areas; and (ii) exploring the role of polymorphic enzymes relevant to the biotransformation of benzene in the inter-individual variability of biomarkers. Each subject covered by bicycle: (i) inner city routes with often jammed traffic; and (ii) open rural routes. Time-weighted average airborne concentrations of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) were determined during 2-h runs. BTEX were determined by solid-phase micro-extraction (SPME) followed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in blood and spot urine samples collected just before and immediately after the runs. Urinary t,t-muconic acid was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-UV. Genotypes of epoxide hydrolase (EH) and glutathione-S-transferase class mu-1 (GSTM1) were also characterised. As compared to pre-run values, benzene and toluene in blood, and toluene and xylenes in urine significantly increased after urban runs. Urinary t,t-muconic acid was significantly higher in post-run samples after both urban (P < 0.001) and rural runs (P < 0.05). Despite a narrow range of exposure levels, a significant relationship was observed between airborne benzene and post-run t,t-muconic acid (r2 = 0.349, P < 0.00). When subgroups were distinguished according to EH and GSTM, subjects bearing both the EH wild type and GSTM 'null' genotype showed significant exposure-related changes in t,t-muconic acid excretion. Even at very low exposure levels, a 2-h bike run in a polluted urban environment may give rise to measurable changes in biomarkers of internal dose of selected aromatic hydrocarbons. Genetically-based metabolic differences may account for part of the inter-individual variability of biomarkers of exposure.
10511279	Determination of S-phenylmercapturic acid in urine as an indicator of exposure to benzene. S-phenylmercapturic acid (S-PMA) was measured in urine from 145 subjects exposed to low benzene concentrations in the air (C(I), benzene). The 8-h, time-weighted exposure intensity of individual workers was monitored by means of charcoal tubes and subsequent gas-chromatographic analysis after desorption with CS2. S-PMA excretion level in urine was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. The following linear correlation was found between S-PMA concentrations in urine and benzene concentrations in the breathing zone: log(S-PMA, microg/g creatinine) = 0.712 log (C(I)-benzene, ppm) + 1.644 (n = 145, r = 0.74, P < 0.001). The geometric mean (GSD) of S-PMA concentrations in urine from 45 subjects occupationally not exposed to benzene but smoking more than 20 cigarettes/day was 7.8 microg/g creatinine (2.11), the corresponding value among non-smokers being 1.0 microg/g creatinine (2.18). It is concluded that the urinary level of S-PMA can be regarded as a useful indicator of exposure to benzene.
10517224	Liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometric determination of the novel, recently identified thioTEPA metabolite, thioTEPA-mercapturate, in urine. An assay for the quantitative determination of the mercapturic acid conjugate of N,N',N"-triethylenethiophosphoramide (thioTEPA-mercapturate) in human urine has been developed. ThioTEPA-mercapturate, a recently identified metabolite of the alkylating anticancer agent thioTEPA, was analyzed using LC-MS and with direct sample injection. Sulphadiazine was used as internal standard. Linearity was accomplished in the therapeutic relevant range of 1-25 microg/ml; recovery was 84% and both accuracy and precision were less than 20% for the lower limit of quantification (1.0 microg/ml) and less than 10% for the other concentration levels. The stability of thioTEPA-mercapturate proved to be satisfactory over a period of 2 months, when kept at -80 degrees C. ThioTEPA-mercapturate urine concentrations of two patients treated with thioTEPA are presented demonstrating the applicability of the assay for clinical samples.
10517234	Rapid determination of the anti-cancer drug chlorambucil (Leukeran) and its phenyl acetic acid mustard metabolite in human serum and plasma by automated solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A bioanalytical method for the determination of the anticancer drug chlorambucil (Leukeran) and its phenyl acetic acid mustard metabolite in human serum and plasma is described. Automated solid-phase extraction of the analytes is carried out with C18 sorbent packed in a 96 well format microtitre plate using a robotic sample processor. The extracts are analysed by isocratic reversed-phase liquid chromatography using pneumatically and thermally assisted electrospray ionisation (TurboIonspray) with selected reaction monitoring. The method is specific and sensitive, with a range of 4-800 ng/ml in human serum and plasma for both parent drug and metabolite (sample volume 200 microl). The method is accurate and precise with intra-assay and inter-assay precision (C.V.) of <15% and bias <15% for both analytes. The automated extraction procedure is significantly faster than manual sample pre-treatment methods, a batch of 96 samples is extracted in 50 min allowing for faster sample turnaround. The method has been used to provide pharmacokinetic support to biocomparability studies of Leukeran following single doses of oral tablet formulations.
10517350	Analysis of cyclophosphamide and five metabolites from human plasma using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-nitrogen-phosphorus detection. An assay method for the quantification of cyclophosphamide (CY) and five metabolites from human plasma is presented. The procedure is adapted to the chemical properties of the compounds of interest: non-polar compounds are extracted into methylene chloride, concentrated and analyzed by GC-NPD after derivatization, and the remaining aqueous fraction is deproteinated with acetonitrile-methanol prior to separation via reversed-phase HPLC and detection using atmospheric pressure ionization (API)-MS. Standard curves are linear over the required range and reproducible over five months. Plasma concentration-time profiles of CY and metabolites from a patient receiving CY by intravenous infusion (60 mg/kg, once a day for two days) are presented.
10517544	A retrospective study of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine in human hair after multiple doses. The analysis of hair has been proposed as a tool for monitoring drug-treatment compliance. This study was performed to determine if buprenorphine (BPR) and norbuprenorphine (NBPR) could be detected in human hair after controlled administration of drug and to determine if segmental analysis of hair was an accurate record of the dosing history. Subjects with dark hair (six males, six females) received 8 mg sublingual BPR for a maximum of 180 days. Single hair collections were made once after BPR treatment and stored at -20 degrees C until analysis. Hair was aligned scalp-end to tip and then segmented in 3-cm sections. For this study, it was assumed that the mean hair growth rate was 1.0 cm/month. Deuterated internal standard was added to hair segments (2-20 mg of hair) and digested overnight at room temperature with 1 N NaOH. Specimens were extracted with a liquid-liquid procedure and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The limits of quantitation for BPR and NBPR were 3 pg/mg and 5 pg/mg, respectively, for 20 mg of hair. BPR and NBPR concentrations were highest for all subjects in hair segments estimated to correspond to the subject's period of drug treatment. With one exception, NBPR was present in higher concentrations in hair than was the parent compound. BPR concentrations in hair segments ranged from 3.1 pg/mg to 123.8 pg/mg. NBPR concentrations ranged from 4.8 pg/mg to 1517.8 pg/mg. In one subject, BPR and NBPR were not detected in any hair segment. In some subjects, BPR and NBPR were detected in hair segments that did not correspond to the period of drug treatment, suggesting that drug movement may have occurred by diffusion in sweat and other mechanisms. The data from this study also indicate that there is a high degree of intersubject variability in measured concentration of BPR and NBPR in hair segments, even when subjects receive the same dose for an equivalent number of treatment days. Future prospective studies involving controlled drug administration will be necessary to evaluate whether hair can serve as an accurate historical record of variations in the pattern of drug use.
10517562	Urinary excretion profiles of 11-nor-9-carboxy-delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol: a delta9-THCCOOH to creatinine ratio study. Monitoring the major cannabinoid metabolite (delta9-THCCOOH) to creatinine ratio (M/C) has been used to predict new drug use. According to Huestis and Cone, the best accuracy (85.4%) for predicting new marijuana use was a ratio > or = 0.5 from two urine specimens collected at least 24 h apart. Manno et al. recommended an M/C ratio of > or = 1.5. Subjects with a history of chronic marijuana use were screened for cannabinoid use by immunoassay (50-ng/mL cutoff), and presumptive positives were confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for delta9-THCCOOH (15-ng/mL cutoff). Creatinine was analyzed with a cutoff concentration of 25 mg/dL. The study objective was to apply the criteria from both groups of workers to determine if consecutive urine specimens (collected at least 24 h apart) positive for cannabinoids could be used to differentiate new marijuana use from the excretion of residual cannabinoid metabolite (delta9-THCCOOH) in an uncontrolled setting. Serial urine specimens (826) were collected from 26 individuals. Huestis and Cone and Manno et al. ratios indicated new drug use in 83% and 33% of serial urine specimens collected at least 24 h apart, respectively. Clinically, the Huestis and Cone ratio is recommended because of a lower false-negative rate (7.4%) than the Manno et al. false-negative rate (24%). In legal situations, we recommend using the Manno et al. ratio because of its lower false-positive rate (0.1%) as stated by Huestis and Cone.
10529003	MR 20492 and MR 20494: two indolizinone derivatives that strongly inhibit human aromatase. In this study, we describe the synthesis of a new family of indolizinone derivatives designed to fit an extrahydrophobic pocket within the active site of aromatase and to strongly inhibit human aromatase. This could help improve the specificity of the inhibitors. Equine aromatase, very well characterized biochemically, is used as a comparative model. Indeed, in a previous comparison between both human and equine aromatases, we described the importance of the interaction between the inhibitor and this pocket for the indane derivative MR 20814. MR 20492 and MR 20494 are more potent inhibitors of human aromatase (Ki/Km: 1.0+/-0.3 and 0.5+/-0.3, respectively). The Ki/Km for MR 20494 is slightly higher than that obtained for fadrozole (0.1+/-0.0) and Ki/Km for both indolizinone derivatives are lower than those obtained for 4-hydroxyandrostenedione (1.9+/-0.8) and MR 20814 (8.1+/-.7). These new compounds are not enzyme inactivators. Moreover, as indicated by the higher Ki/Km values obtained with equine enzyme (9.0+/-0.6 and 6.1+/-1.6 for MR 20492 and MR 20494, respectively), both human and equine aromatase active sites appear to be structurally different. Difference absorption spectra study (350-500 nm) revealed that MR20492 and MR20494 were characterized by a combination of type-I and -II spectra with both enzymes. This result could be due to the isomerization of the molecule in polar solvent (Z and E forms). The evaluation of these new molecules, as well as 4-hydroxyandrostenedione and fadrozole, on aromatase activity in transfected 293 cell cultures evidenced a strong inhibition (IC50: 0.20+/-0.03 microM, 0.20+/-0.02 microM and 0.50+/-0.40 microM for MR 20494, fadrozole and 4-OHA, respectively) except for MR 20492 (3.9+/-0.9 microM) and MR 20814 (10.5+/-0.6 microM). These results proved that these molecules formed part of a promising family of potent inhibitors and that they penetrate 293 cells, without evidencing any cytotoxicity in Hela cells with MTT assay. This is thus encouraging for the development of new drugs for the treatment of estrogen-dependent cancers, these molecules also constitute new tools for understanding the aromatase active site.
10552081	The time course of metabolites in human plasma after 6-[(18)F]fluoro-l-m-tyrosine administration. For the investigation of intracerebral dopamine metabolism, 6-[(18)F]fluoro-l-m-tyrosine (FmT) has been proposed as an alternative tracer that, unlike 6-[(18)F]fluoro-l-dopa, is not subjected to O-methylation. We have studied the time course of FmT and its labelled metabolites in plasma after intravenous injection into humans, employing a method that we have developed and validated to analyze labelled metabolites of FmT in plasma. The study population comprised 38 subjects, 14 of whom were taking an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor (carbidopa), and obtained arterialized venous blood samples at various times after an intravenous injection of between 185 and 370 MBq of FmT. The major metabolite of FmT present in plasma was 6-[(18)F]fluoro-3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid. The time course of the fraction of radioactivity in plasma attributable to FmT was fitted well by the decay of two exponential functions. The fast component of the decay accounted for 40%-50% of the radioactivity and had a half-life of about 5 min. The slow component of the decay had a half-life of about 6 h in the subjects not taking carbidopa and 20 h in the patients taking carbidopa. When the total available FmT was calculated for each individual subject and expressed as a proportion of total radioactivity, this quantity did not differ significantly from that determined from the corresponding population mean. There was significantly more (15% on average) FmT available over the course of the 2-h experiment in the group pretreated with carbidopa. Our results demonstrate that the major metabolite in plasma after an intravenous injection of FmT is 6-[(18)F]fluoro-3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid. The clearance of FmT from plasma compares well with the clearance of intravenously administered levodopa. Carbidopa increases significantly the availability of FmT in plasma. These results verify, in a large number of human subjects, earlier analyses of FmT metabolism in other species. We validate a population-derived approach that can adequately describe the time course of FmT in plasma, alleviating the need for metabolite analysis.
10563869	Practical immunochemical method for determination of 3,5, 6-trichloro-2-pyridinol in human urine: applications and considerations for exposure assessment. An analytical method is described for the quantitative determination of 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (3,5,6-TCP) in human urine. This is the primary analyte found in urine as a result of exposure to chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos-methyl, triclopyr, or 3,5,6-TCP. Conjugates of 3,5,6-TCP are released from urine by acid hydrolysis. The free 3,5,6-TCP is purified using C(18) solid-phase extraction, eluting the analyte with 1-chlorobutane. An aliquot of 1-chlorobutane is placed in a vial containing Trichloropyridinol Sample Diluent and evaporated, leaving the 3,5,6-TCP in the aqueous sample diluent. The samples are assayed using the Trichloropyridinol RaPID Assay immunoassay test kit. Final results are calculated using a standard curve constructed by linear regression after a ln/Logit data transformation is performed of the concentration and the absorbance readings, respectively. The calculated lower limit of quantitation for 3,5,6-TCP in fortified control urine samples is 2. 96 ng/mL (2.96 ppb). Residues of 3,5,6-TCP determined using both immunochemical and gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection correlate well.
10579472	The roles of cytochrome P450 3A4 and 1A2 in the 3-hydroxylation of quinine in vivo. To investigate the roles of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 in the 3-hydroxylation of quinine in vivo. In a randomized, three-way crossover study, nine healthy Swedish volunteers received single oral doses of quinine hydrochloride (500 mg), quinine hydrochloride (500 mg) plus ketoconazole (100 mg twice daily for 3 days), and quinine hydrochloride (500 mg) plus fluvoxamine (25 mg twice daily for 2 days) on three different occasions. Blood and urine samples were collected before quinine intake and up to 96 hours thereafter. Plasma and urine samples were analyzed for both quinine and its main metabolite 3-hydroxyquinine with HPLC methods. Coadministration with ketoconazole (which inhibits CYP3A4) decreased the mean apparent oral clearance of quinine significantly (P < .001) by 31% (from 8.7 to 6.0 L/h), whereas coadministration with fluvoxamine (which inhibits CYP1A2 and to some extent CYP2C19) had no significant effect (P > .05) on the mean apparent oral clearance of quinine. Coadministration with ketoconazole also decreased the mean area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) of 3-hydroxyquinine (from 28.4 to 19.7 micromol x h x L(-1); P < .001), whereas coadministration with fluvoxamine increased 3-hydroxyquinine AUC significantly (from 28.4 to 30.2 micromol x h x L(-1); P < .05). Cytochrome P450 3A4 is important for the 3-hydroxylation of quinine in vivo. On the other hand, CYP1A2 had no significant effect on this metabolic pathway.
10594468	A mechanism-based pharmacokinetic-enzyme model for cyclophosphamide autoinduction in breast cancer patients. This study investigated the pharmacokinetics of cyclophosphamide (CP) and its main metabolite 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide (4-OH-CP) in patients with breast cancer undergoing high dose chemotherapy prior to autologous stem cell transplantation. An enzyme turn-over model was also developed to study the time course of cyclophosphamide induction. Fourteen patients received a combination of CP (6 g m-2 ), thiotepum (500 mg m-2 ) and carboplatin (800 mg m-2 ) as a 96 h infusion. Plasma concentrations of CP and 4-OH-CP were determined with h.p.l.c. and a pharmacokinetic and enzyme turn-over model applied to data using NONMEM. CP plasma concentrations were described by a two-compartment model with a noninducible and an inducible pathway, the latter forming 4-OH-CP. In the final enzyme model, CP affects the amount of enzymes by increasing the enzyme production rate. CP concentrations decreased during the infusion with no subsequent change in 4-OH-CP concentrations. CP inducible and noninducible clearance were estimated to 1.76 l h-1 (90% C.I. 0.92-2.58) and 1.14 l h-1 (0.31-1.85), respectively. The induction resulted in an approximately doubled CP clearance through the inducible pathway at the end of treatment. The model predicted the enzyme turn-over half-life to be 24 h. The presented mechanism-based enzyme induction model where the pharmacokinetics of the inducer and the enzyme pool counterbalance each other successfully described CP autoinduction. It is reasonable to believe that CP affects its own elimination by increasing the enzyme production rate and thereby increasing the amount of enzyme by which CP is eliminated.
10594474	CYP3A4 drug interactions: correlation of 10 in vitro probe substrates. Many substrates of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 are used for in vitro investigations of drug metabolism and potential drug-drug interactions. The aim of the present study was to determine the relationship between 10 commonly used CYP3A4 probes using modifiers with a range of inhibitory potency. The effects of 34 compounds on CYP3A4-mediated metabolism were investigated in a recombinant CYP3A4 expression system. Inhibition of erythromycin, dextromethorphan and diazepam N-demethylation, testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation, midazolam 1-hydroxylation, triazolam 4-hydroxylation, nifedipine oxidation, cyclosporin oxidation, terfenadine C-hydroxylation and N-dealkylation and benzyloxyresorufin O-dealkylation was evaluated at the apparent Km or S50 (for substrates showing sigmoidicity) value for each substrate and at an inhibitor concentration of 30 microM. While all CYP3A4 probe substrates demonstrate some degree of similarity, examination of the coefficients of determination, together with difference and cluster analysis highlighted that seven substrates can be categorized into two distinct substrate groups. Erythromycin, cyclosporin and testosterone form the most closely related group and dextromethorphan, diazepam, midazolam and triazolam form a second group. Terfenadine can be equally well placed in either group, while nifedipine shows a distinctly different relationship. Benzyloxyresorufin shows the weakest correlation with all the other CYP3A4 probes. Modifiers that caused negligible inhibition or potent inhibition are generally comparable in all assays, however, the greatest variability is apparent with compounds causing, on average, intermediate inhibition. Modifiers of this type may cause substantial inhibition, no effect or even activation depending on the substrate employed. It is recommended that multiple CYP3A4 probes, representing each substrate group, are used for the in vitro assessment of CYP3A4-mediated drug interactions.
10594487	Effect of diclofenac, disulfiram, itraconazole, grapefruit juice and erythromycin on the pharmacokinetics of quinidine. In vitro studies suggest that the oxidation of quinidine to 3-hydroxyquinidine is a specific marker reaction for CYP3A4 activity. To assess the possible use of this reaction as an in vivo marker of CYP3A4 activity, we studied the involvement of cytochromes CYP2C9, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 in the in vivo oxidative metabolism of quinidine. An open study of 30 healthy young male volunteers was performed. The pharmacokinetics of a 200 mg single oral dose of quinidine was studied before and during daily administration of 100 mg diclofenac, a CYP2C9 substrate (n=6); 200 mg disulfiram, an inhibitor of CYP2E1 (n=6); 100 mg itraconazole, an inhibitor of CYP3A4 (n=6); 250 ml single strength grapefruit juice twice daily, an inhibitor of CYP3A4 (n=6); 250 mg of erythromycin 4 times daily, an inhibitor of CYP3A4 (n=6). Probes of other enzyme activities, caffeine (CYP1A2), sparteine (CYP2D6), mephenytoin (CYP2C19), tolbutamide (CYP2C9) and cortisol (CYP3A4) were also studied. Concomitant administration of diclofenac reduced the partial clearance of quinidine by N-oxidation by 27%, while no effect was found for other pharmacokinetic parameters of quinidine. Concomitant administration of disulfiram did not alter any of the pharmacokinetic parameters of quinidine. Concomitant administration of itraconazole reduced quinidine total clearance, partial clearance by 3-hydroxylation and partial clearance by N-oxidation by 61, 84 and 73%, respectively. The renal clearance was reduced by 60% and the elimination half-life increased by 35%. Concomitant administration of grapefruit juice reduced the total clearance of quinidine and its partial clearance by 3-hydroxylation and N-oxidation by 15, 19 and 27%, respectively. The elimination half-life of quinidine was increased by 19%. The caffeine metabolic index was reduced by 25%. Concomitant administration of erythromycin reduced the total clearance of quinidine and its partial clearance by 3-hydroxylation and N-oxidation by 34, 50 and 33%, respectively. Cmax was increased by 39%. The results confirm an important role for CYP3A4 in the oxidation of quinidine in vivo, and this applies particularly to the formation of 3-hydroxyquinidine. While a minor contribution of CYP2C9 to the N-oxidation of quinidine is possible, a major involvement of the CYP2C9 or CYP2E1 enzymes in the oxidation of quinidine in vivo is unlikely.
10604819	Effect of felbamate on clobazam and its metabolite kinetics in patients with epilepsy. The authors report preliminary findings on the effect of the new generation antiepileptic drug (AED) felbamate (FBM) on steady state plasma concentrations of clobazam (CLB), a benzodiazepine (frequently used as add-on therapy in patients with refractory epilepsy) and its active metabolite n-desmethyl-clobazam (N-CLB). The authors prospectively collected plasma samples from 66 children and adults with epilepsy receiving chronic CLB therapy. On the basis of concomitant AEDs, patients were divided into three subgroups otherwise comparable for age and weight-adjusted daily dose of CLB: group A (n = 22), receiving CLB monotherapy or CLB plus AEDs without inducing properties of cytochrome P450 (CYP) metabolism, namely valproic acid (VPA) or lamotrigine (LTG); group B (n = 28), receiving CLB plus AED inducer polytherapy (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin), even associated with VPA (n = 9) or LTG (n = 12); group C (n = 16), receiving CLB plus FBM, associated with AED inducers, VPA or LTG. Level to weight-adjusted dose ratio (L/D) of CLB in groups B and C was twofold lower compared to group A (p < 0.001). L/D of N-CLB was twofold higher in group B and fivefold in group C compared to group A (p < 0.00 1). The metabolite-to-parent drug ratio shifted from a median value of 2.8 in group A to 13 in group B, and up to 29 in patients receiving polytherapy with FBM (p < 0.001). These data confirm previous reports of a significant increase in CLB clearance in patients receiving AED inducers, leading to an accumulation of its main metabolite. They also provide novel evidence of a further marked increase in N-CLB plasma concentrations in patients receiving FBM cotherapy. From a clinical point of view, this finding should be kept in mind in explaining possible toxicity in patients on complex AED polytherapy. Furthermore, knowledge of the in vivo interaction between CLB and FBM could help in identifying the CYP isoforms involved in the metabolism of both CLB and N-CLB.
10608481	Fluvoxamine is a more potent inhibitor of lidocaine metabolism than ketoconazole and erythromycin in vitro. CYP3A4 is generally believed to be the major CYP enzyme involved in the biotransformation of lidocaine in man; however, recent in vivo studies suggest that this may not be the case. We have examined the effects of the CYP3A4 inhibitors erythromycin and ketoconazole and the CYP1A2 inhibitor fluvoxamine on the N-deethylation, i.e. formation of monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX), and 3-hydroxylation of lidocaine by human liver microsomes. The experiments were carried out at lidocaine concentrations of 5 microM (clinically relevant concentration) and 800 microM. The formation of both MEGX and 3-hydroxylidocaine was best described by a two-enzyme model. At 5 microM of lidocaine, fluvoxamine was a potent inhibitor of the formation of MEGX (IC50 1.2 microM). Ketoconazole and erythromycin also showed an inhibitory effect on MEGX formation, but ketoconazole (IC50 8.5 microM) was a much more potent inhibitor than erythromycin (IC50 200 microM). At 800 microM of lidocaine, fluvoxamine (IC50 20.7 microM) and ketoconazole (IC50 20.4 microM) displayed a modest inhibitory effect on MEGX formation, whereas erythromycin was a weak inhibitor (IC50 >250 microM). The 3-hydroxylation of lidocaine was potently inhibited by fluvoxamine at both lidocaine concentrations (IC50 0.16 microM at 5 microM and 1.8 microM at 800 microM). Erythromycin and ketoconazole showed a clear inhibitory effect on the 3-hydroxylation of lidocaine at 5 microM of lidocaine (IC50 9.9 microM and 13.9 microM, respectively), but did not show a consistent effect at 800 microM of lidocaine (IC50 >250 microM and 75.0 microM, respectively). Although further studies are needed to elucidate the role of distinct CYP enzymes in the biotransformation of lidocaine in humans, the findings of this study suggest that while both CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 are involved in the metabolism of lidocaine by human liver microsomes, CYP1A2 is the more important isoform at clinically relevant lidocaine concentrations.
10616189	Metabolism of N-nitrosobenzylmethylamine by human cytochrome P-450 enzymes. N-Nitrosobenzylmethylamine (NBzMA) is a potent esophageal carcinogen in rodents, and has been found as a dietary contaminant in certain areas of China where esophageal cancer is endemic. To determine which cytochrome P-450 enzymes in humans are primarily responsible for NBzMA metabolism, microsomes from lymphoblastoid cell lines expressing a panel of human cytochrome P-450s (CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4) and a panel of 10 different human liver microsomal preparations were examined for their abilities to metabolize [3H]NBzMA. In addition, the ability of human liver microsomes to form various NBzMA metabolites was correlated with the abilities of these preparations to metabolize coumarin, ethoxyresorufin, chlorzoxazone, 7-ethoxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin, S-mephenytoin, and nifedipine. NBzMA metabolites were quantitated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with flow-through radioactivity detection. Major metabolites included benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol, benzoic acid, and several uncharacterized radioactive peaks. Of the representative P-450 activities, only CYP2E1 and CYP2A6 catalyzed substantial metabolism of NBzMA. Compared to CYP2E1, CYP2A6 metabolized NBzMA more readily. NBzMA acted as a potent inhibitor of coumarin 7-hydroxylation in CYP2A6 microsomes. Human liver microsomes metabolized NBzMA readily. NBzMA metabolite formation was most highly correlated with coumarin 7-hydroxylase activity, a marker of CYP2A6 activity. 8-Methoxypsoralen substantially inhibited NBzMA metabolism in human hepatic microsomes. When the effects of the potent isothiocyanates PEITC and PHITC were analyzed on microsomes from cell lines expressing CYP2E1 and CYP2A6, it was found that PEITC inhibited both enzymes, PHITC was the more effective inhibitor of CYP2E1, and PHITC was an ineffective inhibitor of CYP2A6. Collectively, these data indicate that CYP2A6 and, to a lesser degree, CYP2E1 are important P-450 enzymes in the activation of NBzMA in human systems.
10647495	Clinical pharmacokinetics of the irinotecan metabolite 4-piperidinopiperidine and its possible clinical importance. To investigate the clinical relevance of 4-piperidinopiperidine (4PP) in the activity of irinotecan (CPT-11), a high-performance liquid chromatography-turboionspray-tandem mass spectrometry assay for plasma 4PP was developed. Plasma samples were prepared for analysis following C18 solid-phase extraction. Chromatography was performed on a Waters Nova-Pak Phenyl column. Selected reaction monitoring with the mass transitions m/z 169.2 --> 84.2 and 139.2 --> 98.1 was used for the detection of 4PP and the internal standard (IS), 1-piperidineproprionitrile, respectively. The assay was linear from 14.8 to 591.0 nM with absolute recoveries of 4PP (59.1 nM) and IS (143.7 nM) of 85.7% (n = 10) and 86.7% (n = 10), respectively. The accuracy and imprecision of the method (total) was > or = 96.8% and < or = 8.5% over the concentration range studied, respectively. 4PP was detectable in plasma following the administration of 125, 350, 500 mg/m2 and 600 mg/m2 CPT-11 to patients, with AUC(4PP) correlated with the dose (r2 = 0.66). Plasma concentrations of 4PP declined slowly with a long terminal half-life (33.4 +/- 17.1 h). Overall, the concentrations of 4PP in plasma were in the sub-micromolar range (< 206.9 nM) and substantially lower than those capable of inducing apoptosis of cancer cells.
10647921	Species comparison of hepatic and pulmonary metabolism of benzene. Benzene is an occupational hazard and environmental toxicant found in cigarette smoke, gasoline, and the chemical industry. The major health concern associated with benzene exposure is leukemia. Studies using microsomal preparations from human, mouse, rabbit, and rat to determine species differences in the metabolism of benzene to phenol, hydroquinone and catechol, indicate that the rat is most similar, both quantitatively and qualitatively, to the human in pulmonary microsomal metabolism of benzene. With hepatic microsomes, rat is most similar to human in metabolite formation at the two lower concentrations examined (24 and 200 microM), while at the two higher concentrations (700 and 1000 microM) mouse is most similar in phenol formation. In all species, the enzyme system responsible for benzene metabolism approached saturation in hepatic microsomes but not in pulmonary microsomes. In pulmonary microsomes from mouse, rat, and human, phenol appeared to competitively inhibit benzene metabolism resulting in a greater proportion of phenol being converted to hydroquinone when the benzene concentration increased. The opposite effect was seen in hepatic microsomes. These findings support the hypothesis that the lung plays an important role in benzene metabolism, and therefore, toxicity.
10663643	Pharmacokinetics of levamisole in cancer patients treated with 5-fluorouracil. To investigate the pharmacokinetics of levamisole and a metabolite, p-hydroxylevamisole in patients with colorectal cancer treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Following an intravenous bolus dose of 5-FU, 20 patients with colorectal cancer received oral doses of 50 mg levamisole every 8 h for 3 days. Immediately after the last dose, blood and urine samples were collected over at least an 8-h period. Samples were assayed for levamisole and p-hydroxylevamisole by GC/MS. The levamisole plasma and urine data were subjected to pharmacokinetic analysis using NONMEM software. Substantial interpatient variability was observed in the levamisole plasma concentration-time curves. Patients with cardiovascular or gastrointestinal complications demonstrated altered absorption of levamisole. Pharmacokinetic parameter values for levamisole were similar to those obtained previously in healthy subjects and other cancer patients. There is no evidence that the pharmacokinetics of levamisole are altered by 5-FU administered immediately prior to levamisole administration. The relationship between the substantial intersubject variability in levamisole plasma concentration-time curves and clinical outcome following 5-FU/levamisole adjuvant chemotherapy should be examined.
10676997	Sensitive determination of irinotecan (CPT-11) and its active metabolite SN-38 in human serum using liquid chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry. A couple of sensitive and accurate liquid chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry (LC- S-MS) methods for the determination of the total forms of irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 in human serum, using the same chromatographic and detection conditions, is presented. Both used camptothecin as internal standard (I.S.). The sample pretreatment for irinotecan involved a simple protein precipitation with acetonitrile, whereas a liquid-liquid extraction was necessary for SN-38. A Symmetry C18, 3.5 microm (150 x 1 mm I.D.) reversed-phase column was used for the chromatographic separation, together with a gradient elution of acetonitrile in 5 mM ammonium formate buffer (pH 3) as mobile phase. After ionisation in the pneumatically-assisted electrospray source and in-source collision induced dissociation, acquisition was performed in the selected ion monitoring mode. Recoveries were 69 and 47% on average, detection limits 2.5 and 0.25 ng/ml and quantitation limits 10 and 0.5 ng/ml for irinotecan and SN-38, respectively. Reproducibility was good and the method was linear from limits of quantitation up to 10,000 ng/ml for irinotecan, and up to 100 ng/ml for SN-38. This sensitive and highly specific method is suitable both for pharmacokinetic studies and routine therapeutic drug monitoring.
10682228	Diurnal motor variations to repeated doses of levodopa in Parkinson's disease. Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) in long-term levodopa therapy often complain of worsening of motor symptoms in the afternoon and evening. The pathophysiology of this phenomenon is not known. We evaluated the motor response to repeated doses of levodopa during a 12-hour period in 52 parkinsonian patients (19 de novo, 20 stable, and 13 wearing-off). On the day of the study, all patients received standard doses of levodopa/carbidopa at 8:00 a.m., 12:00 noon, and 4:00 p.m. Motor measurements such as tapping test, walking time, and tremor score, and blood samples for levodopa and 3-O-methyldopa (3OMD) plasma analysis, were performed hourly. Mean motor scores and pharmacokinetic data, evaluated for a period of 3 hours after each levodopa dose, were compared. In de novo patients, we did not observe diurnal changes in motor score, whereas a progressive daytime worsening was visible in stable and wearing-off patients. No significant difference in levodopa pharmacokinetics after each levodopa dose was observed within each patient group, whereas 3OMD plasma levels significant increased with repeated levodopa administrations. However, no significant correlation between motor scores and 3OMD plasma levels was observed, suggesting that the diminishing motor response to afternoon and evening doses of levodopa in patients in long-term levodopa therapy does not relate to the pharmacokinetics of the drug. It is possible that this phenomenon may be an expression of the occurrence of tolerance to repeated doses of levodopa.
10692561	Role of human liver microsomal CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in catalyzing N-dechloroethylation of cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide. The anticancer alkylating agents cyclophosphamide (CPA) and ifosfamide (IFA) are prodrugs that undergo extensive P450-catalyzed metabolism to yield both active (4-hydroxylated) and therapeutically inactive but neurotoxic (N-dechloroethylated) metabolites. Whereas the human liver microsomal P450 catalysts of CPA and IFA 4-hydroxylation are well characterized, the P450 enzyme catalysts of the alternative N-dechloroethylation pathway are poorly defined. Analysis of a panel of fifteen human P450 cDNAs in the baculovirus expression system ('Supersomes') demonstrated that CYP3A4 exhibited the highest N-dechloroethylation activity toward both CPA and IFA, whereas CYP2B6 displayed high N-dechloroethylation activity toward IFA, but not CPA. The contributions of each human P450 to overall liver microsomal N-dechloroethylation were calculated using a recently described relative substrate-activity factor method, and were found to be in excellent agreement with the results of inhibition studies using the CYP3A inhibitor troleandomycin and an inhibitory monoclonal antibody to CYP2B6. With CPA as substrate, CYP3A4 was shown to catalyze >/=95% of liver microsomal N-dechloroethylation, whereas with IFA as substrate, CYP3A4 catalyzed an average of approximately 70% of liver microsomal N-dechloroethylation (range = 40-90%), with the balance of this activity catalyzed by CYP2B6 (range = 10-70%, dependent on the CYP2B6 content of the liver). Because CYP2B6 can make a significant contribution to human liver microsomal IFA N-dechloroethylation, but only a minor contribution to IFA 4-hydroxylation, the selective inhibition of hepatic CYP2B6 activity in individuals with a high hepatic CYP2B6 content may provide a useful approach to minimize the formation of therapeutically inactive but toxic N-dechloroethylated IFA metabolites.
10696794	Metabolism and toxicity of trichloroethylene and S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine in freshly isolated human proximal tubular cells. Trichloroethylene (Tri) caused modest cytotoxicity in freshly isolated human proximal tubular (hPT) cells, as assessed by significant decreases in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity after 1 h of exposure to 500 microM Tri. Oxidative metabolism of Tri by cytochrome P-450 to form chloral hydrate (CH) was only detectable in kidney microsomes from one patient out of four tested and was not detected in hPT cells. In contrast, GSH conjugation of Tri was detected in cells from every patient tested. The kinetics of Tri metabolism to its GSH conjugate S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)glutathione (DCVG) followed biphasic kinetics, with apparent Km and Vmax values of 0.51 and 24.9 mM and 0.10 and 1.0 nmol/min per mg protein, respectively. S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine (DCVC), the cysteine conjugate metabolite of Tri that is considered the penultimate nephrotoxic species, caused both time- and concentration-dependent increases in LDH release in freshly isolated hPT cells. Preincubation of hPT cells with 0.1 mM aminooxyacetic acid did not protect hPT cells from DCVC-induced cellular injury, suggesting that another enzyme besides the cysteine conjugate beta-lyase may be important in DCVC bioactivation. This study is the first to measure the cytotoxicity and metabolism of Tri and DCVC in freshly isolated cells from the human kidney. These data indicate that the pathway involved in the cytotoxicity and metabolism of Tri in hPT cells is the GSH conjugation pathway and that the cytochrome P-450-dependent pathway has little direct role in renal Tri metabolism in humans.
10702251	4-hydroxyretinoic acid, a novel substrate for human liver microsomal UDP-glucuronosyltransferase(s) and recombinant UGT2B7. It is suggested that formation of more polar metabolites of all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) via oxidative pathways limits its biological activity. In this report, we investigated the biotransformation of oxidized products of atRA via glucuronidation. For this purpose, we synthesized 4-hydroxy-RA (4-OH-RA) in radioactive and nonradioactive form, 4-hydroxy-retinyl acetate (4-OH-RAc), and 5,6-epoxy-RA, all of which are major products of atRA oxidation. Glucuronidation of these retinoids by human liver microsomes and human recombinant UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) was characterized and compared with the glucuronidation of atRA. The human liver microsomes glucuronidated 4-OH-RA and 4-OH-RAc with 6- and 3-fold higher activity than atRA, respectively. Analysis of the glucuronidation products showed that the hydroxyl-linked glucuronides of 4-OH-RA and 4-OH-RAc were the major products, as opposed to the formation of the carboxyl-linked glucuronide with atRA, 4-oxo-RA, and 5,6-epoxy-RA. We have also determined that human recombinant UGT2B7 can glucuronidate atRA, 4-OH-RA, and 4-OH-RAc with activities similar to those found in human liver microsomes. We therefore postulate that this human isoenzyme, which is expressed in human liver, kidney, and intestine, plays a key role in the biological fate of atRA. We also propose that atRA induces its own oxidative metabolism via a cytochrome P450 (CYP26) and is further biotransformed into glucuronides via UGT-mediated pathways.
10706426	Metabolites of orally administered Perilla frutescens extract in rats and humans. As a part of our search for bioactive substances from the leaves of Perilla frutescens BRITTON var. acuta KUDO (Perillae Herba, Labiatae), the aqueous extract was orally administered to rats and humans, and metabolites in the urine, plasma, and/or bile were analyzed by a high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) equipped with a photodiode array detector. When the extract was administered to rats, 10 metabolites, trans-caffeic acid-4-O-sulfate (1), trans-p-coumaric acid-4-O-sulfate (2), trans-ferulic acid-4-O-sulfate (3), trans-m-coumaric acid-3-O-sulfate (4), trans-caffeic acid (5), m-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid (6), trans-p-coumaric acid (7), trans-m-coumaric acid (8), luteolin (9), and apigenin (10) were detected in the urine, whereas four metabolites, scutellarein-6, 7-di-O-beta-glucuronide (11), apigenin-4'-O-sulfate-7-O-beta-glucuronide (12), apigenin-7-O-beta-glucuronide (13), and diosmetin-7-O-beta-glucuronide (14) were found in the bile. Compounds 1-8 and 11-14 were also found in the plasma. When the extract was given to humans, however, two metabolites, 1-O-(2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamoyl)-beta-glucuronic acid (15) and apigenin-4'-O-beta-glucuronide (16), were found in the urine and plasma. Thus, a species difference in the metabolism of the extract constituents was observed between rats and humans. Structures 1-16 were identified based on their chemical and spectral data.
10718645	Determination of estramustine phosphate and its metabolites estromustine, estramustine, estrone and estradiol in human plasma by liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection and gas chromatography with nitrogen-phosphorus and mass spectrometric detection. Bioanalytical methods for the determination of estramustine phosphate by liquid chromatography and its four main metabolites estromustine, estramustine, estrone and estradiol by gas chromatography are described. For the estramustine phosphate assay the plasma was purified by protein precipitation followed by a C18 solid-phase extraction. For the metabolite assay the plasma samples were purified by a C18 solid-phase and liquid-liquid extraction procedure and derivatised by silanization. Thereafter, estramustine and estromustine were quantified by gas chromatography with nitrogen-phosphorus detection and estradiol and estrone were quantified by gas chromatography with selected ion monitoring. The methods were validated with respect to linearity, selectivity, precision, accuracy, limit of quantitation, limit of detection, recovery and stability. The limit of quantitation was 2.3 micromol/l for estramustine phosphate, 30 nmol/l for estromustine and estramustine, 12 nmol/l for estrone and 8 nmol/l for estradiol. The results showed good precision and accuracy for estramustine phosphate and the four metabolites. The intermediate precision was 6.2-13.5% (C.V.) and the accuracy was 91.8-103.9%.
10718660	Simultaneous stereoselective high-performance liquid chromatographic determination of 10-hydroxycarbazepine and its metabolite carbamazepine-10,11-trans-dihydrodiol in human urine. An enantioselective HPLC method for the simultaneous determination of the concentration of the enantiomers of the oxcarbazepine metabolites 10-hydroxycarbazepine (MHD) and carbamazepine-10,11-trans-dihydrodiol (DHD) in human urine is described. The method is based on extraction with tert.-butylmethyl ether-dichloromethane (2:1, v/v) under alkaline conditions, separation and evaporation of the organic phase and dissolution of the residue in the mobile phase. Enantiomers are resolved on a Diacel Chiralcel OD column (250 mm x 4.6 mm I.D.) under isocratic conditions using as mobile phase n-hexane-ethanol-2-propanol (18:2:1, v/v/v) with addition of glacial acetic acid (0.1%). The enantiomers are detected by UV at 215 nm. The method allows reliable determination of the MHD and DHD enantiomers in human urine with limits of quantification of 0.2 mg/l and 0.4 mg/l, respectively.
10741474	Biological monitoring of standardized exposure to ethylbenzene: evaluation of a biological tolerance (BAT) value. The results of standardized 8 h lasting exposures of n = 18 volunteers to ethylbenzene (EthBz) at levels of 25 and 100% of the maximum allowable concentrations at the workplace (MAK) value of 100 ppm as well as the results of field studies are considered to evaluate a biological tolerance (BAT) value for EthBz. On the basis of the relationship between the external and internal exposure a BAT value of 1.5 mg/l has been set for the EthBz concentration in blood as the most sensitive and specific parameter of exposure to this aromatic hydrocarbon. The interpretation of EthBz blood values has to take into account the short half-life of t1/2 = 0.5 +/- 0.08 h in the first hour after the end of exposure in which this aromatic hydrocarbon is eliminated from the blood. The additional determination of the EthBz metabolites mandelic acid (MA) and phenylglyoxylic acid (PGA), respectively, excreted in post shift urine as well as in urine samples at the beginning of the next shift shows good correlations with the external exposure. The biological half-life of MA was calculated to t1/2 = 5.3 +/- 1.1 h. Because the time of sampling can vary the relationship between the levels of MA to PGA the total concentration of the excreted metabolites depends less on this influence and is therefore better suited for monitoring exposed persons. On the basis of the standardized experiments a BAT value has been proposed of 2 g MA plus PGA corrected per gram creatinine. Both BAT values are adjusted to data which result from earlier standardized exposures during 30 min to EthBz under physical activity of 50 watt on a bicycle ergometer.
10752640	Sulphonation of N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene by human dehydroepiandrosterone sulphotransferase. 1. The aim was to determine which human recombinant sulphotransferase (ST) isoform(s) were responsible for the sulphonation and, thus, potential further bioactivation of the classical hepatic procarcinogen N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene (N-OH-2AAF). 2. N-OH-2AAF was incubated together with the cosubstrate 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulphate (PAPS) and either human liver cytosol or recombinant P-form phenolsulphotransferase (P-PST), M-form PST, dehydroepiandrosterone-ST (DHEA-ST) or oestrogen ST (EST). Formation of 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphate (PAP) from PAPS, measured by HPLC, was used as the assay for determination of sulphoconjugation rates. 3. The liver cytosol produced a 100% increase in PAP formation in the presence of 200 microM N-OH-2AAF as compared with baseline levels (p < 0.01), corresponding to a rate of 19 pmol/min/mg protein. Recombinant P-PST, however, was without effect. This is in contrast to previous suggestions using crude enzyme preparations. Like P-PST, recombinant M-PST and EST did not sulphonate N-OH-2AAF. On the other hand, recombinant DHEA-ST produced a 161% increase in PAP formation in the presence of 200 microM N-OH-2AAF as compared with baseline values (p < 0.001). 4. Kinetic studies of N-OH-2AAF sulphonation by DHEA-ST and human liver cytosol gave similar apparent Kms. Interestingly, the Vmax for N-OH-2AAF sulphonation by DHEA-ST was very similar to that of DHEA, the natural substrate for DHEA-ST. 5. This is the first paper to demonstrate the involvement of the human DHEA-ST in the sulphonation of an N-hydroxylated aromatic amide carcinogen.
10755376	Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric procedures for determination of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) activity and for detection of unstable catecholic metabolites in human and rat liver preparations after COMT catalyzed in statu nascendi derivatization using S-adenosylmethionine. A procedure is presented for determination of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) activity in liver cytosolic preparations using 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine as substrate and by quantifying the product 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethylamine (3-MHP). For quantification of 3-MHP in liver cytosolic preparations a gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric procedure after liquid-liquid extraction and acetylation was established and validated. The intra- and inter-day accuracy and precision were better than 15% and 20%, respectively. Extraction efficiency and selectivity were also sufficient. For in statu nascendi derivatization of unstable catecholic metabolites in liver microsome preparations, cytosolic preparations with COMT activities of at least 1 nmol product/min/mg protein were used after addition of S-adenosylmethionine. Such catecholic metabolites, which are claimed to be responsible for toxic effects in vivo, e.g., neurotoxicity or carcinogenesis, must not be overlooked in in vitro metabolism studies. Using this trick, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was suitable for the determination of catecholic metabolites in human and rat liver preparations after the same sample preparation as for 3-MHP quantification. The applicability was exemplified for the antidepressant paroxetine.
10759686	Relative contribution of cytochromes P-450 and flavin-containing monoxygenases to the metabolism of albendazole by human liver microsomes. Albendazole (ABZ; methyl 5-propylthio-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl carbamate) is a broad spectrum anthelmintic whose activity resides both in the parent compound and its sulphoxide metabolite (ABS). There are numerous reports of ABZ metabolism in animals but relatively few in humans. We have investigated the sulphoxidation of ABZ in human liver microsomes and recombinant systems. The specific enzymes involved in the sulphoxidation of ABZ were determined by a combination of approaches; inhibition with an antiserum directed against cytochrome P450 reductase, the effect of selective chemical inhibitors on ABZ sulphoxidation in human liver microsomes, the capability of expressed CYP and FMO to mediate the formation of ABS, regression analysis of the rate of metabolism of ABZ to ABS in human liver microsomes against selective P450 substrates and regression analysis of the rate of ABS sulphoxidation against CYP expression measured by Western blotting. Comparison of Vmax values obtained following heat inactivation (3min at 45 degrees C) of flavin monoxygenases (FMO), chemical inhibition of FMO with methimazole and addition of an antiserum directed against cytochrome P450 reductase indicate that FMO and CYP contribute approximately 30% and 70%, respectively, to ABS production in vitro. Comparison of CLint values suggests CYP is a major contributor in vivo. A significant reduction in ABZ sulphoxidation (n = 3) was seen with ketoconazole (CYP3 A4; 32-37%), ritonavir (CYP3 A4: 34-42%), methimazole (FMO: 28-49%) and thioacetamide (FMO; 32-35%). Additive inhibition with ketoconazole and methimazole was 69 +/- 8% (n = 3). ABS production in heat - treated microsomes (3 min at 45 degrees C) correlated significantly with testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation (CYP3A4; P < 0.05) and band intensities on Western blots probed with an antibody selective for 3A4 (P < 0.05). Recombinant human CYP3 A4, CYP1A2 and FMO3 produced ABS in greater quantities than control microsomes, with those expressing CYP3A4 producing threefold more ABS than those expressing CYP1A2. Kinetic studies showed the Km values obtained with both CYP3A4 and FMO3 were similar. We conclude that the production of ABS in human liver is mediated via both FMO and CYP, principally CYP3A4, with the CYP component being the major contributor.
10760502	In vitro glucuronidation of kaempferol and quercetin by human UGT-1A9 microsomes. Flavonoids are important polyphenolic substances with widespread occurrence in plants and therefore in the human diet. Although considerable work has been done on the pharmacology of flavonoids, the understanding of their metabolism is still incomplete. In this work, the in vitro glucuronidation of the common dietary flavonoids quercetin and kaempferol by human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase microsomes (UGT-1A9) was investigated using HPLC and LC-MS. The two flavonoids were extensively metabolised by this enzyme with four monoglucuronides of quercetin and two of kaempferol being detected after incubation. The presence of a quercetin monoglucuronide in the urine of a volunteer after consumption of Ginkgo biloba tablets was demonstrated.
10761165	Single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of an oral once-a-day osmotic controlled-release OROS (methylphenidate HCl) formulation. Methylphenidate is used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). OROS (methylphenidate HCl) is an osmotic controlled-release delivery system designed for once-daily oral dosing. The pharmacokinetics of OROS (methylphenidate HCl) 18 mg qd, sustained-release (SR) methylphenidate 20 mg qd, and the immediate-release (IR) formulation given as three 5 mg doses every 4 hours (tid) were compared in adults. In addition, the single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of the OROS formulation were studied. Following OROS (methylphenidate HCl), there was a gradual increase in the mean methylphenidate plasma concentrations with peak concentrations noted at 6 to 8 hours. With the SR formulation, peak plasma concentrations were noted at approximately 4 hours. Following the IR regimen, methylphenidate plasma concentrations fluctuated in tandem with oral dosing; peak concentrations were noted at 6.5 hours. The terminal half-life of methylphenidate was similar for the three formulations. The dose-normalized methylphenidate Cmax for OROS (methylphenidate HCl) was significantly lower than for IR and SR methylphenidate. The bioavailability of methylphenidate and PPA from OROS (methylphenidate HCl) relative to the IR and SR formulations was complete. Mean methylphenidate AUC and terminal half-life were similar after single (32.9 ng.h/mL and 3.9 hours) and multiple doses (35.2 ng.h/mL and 3.9 hours) of OROS (methylphenidate HCl).
10770451	Steady-state plasma levels of nortriptyline and its hydroxylated metabolites in Japanese patients: impact of CYP2D6 genotype on the hydroxylation of nortriptyline. The authors investigated the impact of the CYP2D6 genotype on steady-state concentrations of nortriptyline (NT) and its metabolites, trans-10-hydroxynortriptyline (EHNT) and cis-10-hydroxynortriptyline in a Japanese population of psychiatric patients. Forty-one patients (20 men and 21 women) were orally administered nortriptyline hydrochloride. The allele frequencies of the CYP2D6*5 and CYP2D6*10 were 4.9% and 34.1%, respectively. Significant differences in NT concentrations corrected for dose and weight were observed between the subjects with no mutated alleles and those with one mutated allele (mean +/- SD for no mutated alleles vs. one mutated allele: 70.3 +/- 25.4 vs. 98.4 +/- 36.6 ng/mL x mg(-1) x kg(-1); t = 2.54, dcf = 33, p < 0.05) and between the subjects with no mutated alleles and two mutated alleles (no mutated alleles vs. two mutated alleles: 70.3 +/- 25.4 vs. 147 +/- 31.1 ng/mL x mg(-1) x kg(-1); t = 5.87, df = 19, p < 0.0001). Also, a significant difference in the NT/EHNT ratio, which is representative of the hydroxylation ratio of NT, was observed between the subjects with no mutated alleles and those with two mutated alleles (no mutated alleles vs. two mutated alleles: 0.82 +/- 0.30 vs. 2.71 +/- 0.84; t = 7.86, df = 19, p < 0.0001). Multiple regression analysis showed that the number of mutated alleles of CYP2D6, which was the only significant factor, accounted for 41% and 48% of the variability in log(NT corrected for dose and weight) and log(NT/EHNT), respectively.
10770456	Pharmacologic profile of perphenazine's metabolites. The authors have previously reported that in elderly patients treated with low doses of perphenazine, few extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) developed in those who were not poor CYP2D6 metabolizers. The authors hypothesized that this atypical side effect profile is due to perphenazine's principal metabolite, n-dealkylperphenazine (DAPZ), which is usually present in vivo at concentrations 1.5 to 2 times that of the parent drug. Perphenazine, DAPZ, and 7-hydroxyperphenazine affinities were examined in vitro by competition-binding analysis to isolated human receptors expressed in transfected cell lines. Perphenazine and metabolite effects were examined in vivo in 54 older patients who were treated with perphenazine, at a target dose of 0.1 mg/kg, for 10 to 17 days. Drug concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. In in vitro binding studies, DAPZ demonstrated a higher affinity for serotonin-2A receptors than for dopamine-2 receptors to an extent comparable to that of some atypical neuroleptic agents. In contrast, perphenazine and 7-hydroxyperphenazine demonstrated a higher affinity for dopamine-2 receptors than for serotonin-2A receptors. The mean +/- SD concentrations in the 54 subjects were the following: perphenazine, 1.5 +/- 1.4 ng/mL; DAPZ, 2.0 +/-1.6 ng/mL; and 7-hydroxyperphenazine, 0.8 +/- 1.9 ng/mL. The mean +/- SD quotient for the DAPZ/perphenazine concentration was 1.7 +/- 1.1 and for the 7-hydroxyperphenazine/perphenazine was 0.54 +/-1.6. EPS onset was not correlated with the perphenazine concentration, the metabolite concentrations, the DAPZ/perphenazine quotient, or the 7-hydroxyperphenazine/perphenazine quotient. Despite a moderately atypical receptor-binding profile, DAPZ does not seem to moderate perphenazine effects in vivo in older patients. This outcome likely reflects the low potency of DAPZ for dopamine-2 and serotonin-2A receptors relative to the potency of perphenazine for these receptors. Further exploration of atypical properties of DAPZ should include de novo administration of this metabolite in animal models.
10774535	Sensitive and selective determination of tetracaine and its metabolite in human samples by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A sensitive and reliable method was developed for the determination of tetracaine and its metabolite, p-butylaminobenzoic acid, in human samples. Tetracaine and the metabolite, effectively extracted using a liquid-liquid extraction procedure from 0.5 g of sample, were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Tetracaine was analyzed without derivatization, and the metabolite was analyzed after tert-butylolimethylsilyl derivatization. Dibucaine and p-dimethylaminobenzoic acid were used as internal standards for tetracaine and the metabolite, respectively. The calibration curve for each compound was linear in the concentration range from 10 to 1,000 ng/0.5 g, and the lower limits of detection were 10 ng/g for tetracaine and 0.6 ng/g for the metabolite in whole blood and tissues. The accuracy and precision of the method were evaluated in whole blood and brain at the concentrations of 50 ng/0.5 g and 500 ng/0.5 g for tetracaine and 10 ng/0.5 g and 100 ng/0.5 g for the metabolite. The coefficients of variation ranged from 0.8 to 3.0% for tetracaine and 2.4 to 9.8% for the metabolite. We used this method to determine tetracaine and its metabolite in human whole blood and tissues of an autopsied patient who died during spinal anesthesia induced by tetracaine.
10774632	Simultaneous plasma level analysis of clomipramine, N-desmethylclomipramine, and fluvoxamine by reversed-phase liquid chromatography. A simple reversed-phase liquid chromatographic method enabling the simultaneous analysis in plasma of the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine, its demethylated metabolite, and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluvoxamine, was developed. The drugs and dibenzepine, the internal standard, were extracted from 1 mL plasma through an automated solid-phase procedure, eluted in a total chromatographic time of approximately 14 min and detected by means of an ultraviolet spectrophotometer preset at 254 nm. An assay sensitivity of 10 microg/L was observed for all analytes. Recoveries for these drugs and their metabolites ranged between 65% and 98% and their coefficient of variation (within-day and day-to-day) between 1.9% and 2.9%. In spiked plasma, within-day and day-to-day imprecision data were less than 5%. The simultaneous determination of clomipramine, N-desmethylclomipramine, and fluvoxamine with adequate sensitivity and accuracy may be useful for the monitoring of drug treatment in depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder, where combinations of such drugs are employed.
10778932	Studies on the metabolism and toxicological detection of the amphetamine-like anorectic fenproporex in human urine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and fluorescence polarization immunoassay. Studies on the metabolism and the toxicological analysis of fenproporex (R,S-3-[(1-phenyl-2-propyl)-amino]-propionitrile, FP) using GC-MS and fluorescence polarization immunoassay are described. The metabolites were identified in urine samples of volunteers by GC-MS after cleavage of conjugates, extraction and acetylation. Besides unchanged FP, fourteen metabolites, including amphetamine, could be identified. Two partially overlapping metabolic pathways could be postulated: ring degradation by one- and two-fold aromatic hydroxylation followed by methylation and side chain degradation by N-dealkylation to amphetamine (AM). A minor pathway leads via beta-hydroxylation of AM to norephedrine. For GC-MS detection, the systematic toxicological analysis procedure including acid hydrolysis, extraction at pH 8-9 and acetylation was suitable (detection limits 50 ng/ml for FP and 100 ng/ml for AM). Excretion studies showed, that only AM but neither FP nor its specific metabolites were detectable 30-60 h after ingestion of 20 mg of FP. Therefore, misinterpretation can occur. The Abbott TDx FPIA amphetamine/methamphetamine II gave positive results up to 58 h. All the positive immunoassay results could be confirmed by the described GC-MS procedure.
10798213	Interindividual variation in metabolism of soy isoflavones and lignans: influence of habitual diet on equol production by the gut microflora. The soy isoflavones, daidzein and genistein, and the lignans, matairesinol and secoisolariciresinol, are phytoestrogens metabolized extensively by the intestinal microflora. Considerable important evidence is already available that shows extensive interindividual variation in isoflavone metabolism, and we have investigated the extent of this variation in a crossover study of a soy-containing food low or high in isoflavones (each treatment period lasted for 17 days, and the 2 treatment periods were separated by a 25-day washout period) in 24 healthy subjects [19 women and 5 men, mean age 30 yr, range 19-40, mean body mass index 22.5 +/- 3.5 (SD) kg/m2]. There was a 16-fold variation in total isoflavonoid excretion in urine after the high-isoflavone treatment period. The variation in urinary equol excretion was greatest (664-fold), and subjects fell into two groups: poor equol excretors and good equol excretors (36%). A significant negative correlation was found between the proportion of energy from fat in the habitual diet and urinary equol excretion (r = -0.55; p = 0.012). Good equol excretors consumed less fat as percentage of energy than poor excretors (26 +/- 2.3% compared with 35 +/- 1.6%, p < 0.01) and more carbohydrate as percentage of energy than poor excretors (55 +/- 2.9% compared with 47 +/- 1.7%, p < 0.05). Interindividual variation in the urinary excretion of O-desmethyl-angolensin (O-DMA) was also apparent (76-fold after the high-isoflavone treatment period), but there was no relationship between equol excretion and O-DMA excretion. Enterolactone was the major lignan metabolite in urine and plasma but showed less interindividual variation than equol and O-DMA. It is suggested that the dietary fat intake decreases the capacity of gut microbial flora to synthesize equol.
10799653	Identification of the human cytochromes P450 involved in the oxidative metabolism of "Ecstasy"-related designer drugs. The human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes catalyzing the oxidative metabolism of the widely abused amphetamine derivatives MDMA (N-methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, "Ecstasy"), MDE (N-ethyl-3, 4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, "Eve"), and MDA (3, 4-methylenedioxyamphetamine) were identified. Using a simplified non-extractive reversed-phase HPLC assay with fluorescence detection, biphasic Michaelis-Menten kinetics were obtained for formation of all three dihydroxyamphetamines in liver microsomes from a CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer subject. In contrast, no low K(m) component was detectable in microsomes from a poor metabolizer subject. Additional specific probes for CYP2D6 further confirmed this isozyme as the exclusive low K(m) component for demethylenation. P450-selective inhibitors applied to CYP2D6-inhibited microsomes and activity measurements in a series of recombinant P450s suggested CYP1A2 as the major high K(m) component with contributions by CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. Moreover, the relative CYP1A2 content of a panel of 12 human livers was weakly but significantly correlated to the high K(m) demethylenase activity (Spearman rank correlation coefficient [r(s)] = 0.58; P < 0.05). Microsomal maximal velocities for N-dealkylation were at least 7-fold lower than for demethylenation and were characterized by apparently monophasic kinetics. The most important isozyme for this reaction appeared to be CYP2B6, the microsomal content of which was found to be strongly correlated to N-deethylation of MDE (r(s) = 0.90; P < 0.001). We conclude that, in addition to CP2D6 as the sole high-affinity demethylenase, several other P450 isozymes have the capacity to contribute to microsomal oxidative metabolism of methylenedioxyamphetamines. This may be of particular importance in individuals genetically lacking functional CYP2D6.
10800057	The effect of busulphan on the pharmacokinetics of cyclophosphamide and its 4-hydroxy metabolite: time interval influence on therapeutic efficacy and therapy-related toxicity. Busulphan and cyclophosphamide (Bu/CP) are widely used in preparative regimens for bone marrow transplantation. Many studies have shown a wide variation in busulphan pharmacokinetics. Moreover, higher rates of liver toxicity were reported in Bu/CP protocols than in a total body irradiation (TBI)-containing regimen. In the present paper we investigated the effect of the time interval between the last dose of busulphan and the first dose of cyclophosphamide on the pharmacokinetics of CP and its cytotoxic metabolite 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-OHCP). Thirty-six patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation (BMT) were included in the study. We also investigated the occurrence of veno-occlusive disease, mucositis and graft-versus-host disease. Ten patients conditioned with CP followed by TBI served as a control group (TBI). Twenty-six patients were conditioned with Bu/CP. The patients received Bu (1 mg/kg x 4 for 4 days), followed by CP (60 mg/kg for 2 days) administered as a 1-h infusion. Patients received their CP therapy either 7-15 h (group A, n = 12) or 24-50 h (group B, n = 14) after the last dose of Bu. None of the patients were given phenytoin or any other drug known to enhance CP metabolism. The administration of CP less than 24 h after the last dose of Bu resulted in: (1) a significantly (P = 0.003) lower clearance for cyclophosphamide was observed in group A (0.036 l/h/kg) compared to 0.055 and 0.055 l/h/kg, in the B and TBI groups, respectively; (2) significantly (P = 0.002) longer elimination half-life in group A (10.93 h) than in groups B and TBI (6.87 and 7.52 h, respectively); (3) significantly (P < 0.001) lower exposure to the cytotoxic metabolite (4-OHCP), expressed as the ratio AUC4-OHCP/AUCCP, in group A (0.0053) than that obtained in group B (0.013) and group TBI (0.012); (4) the patients in group A had a significantly (P < 0.05) higher incidence of VOD (seven of 12) than the other groups, B and TBI (2/14 and 1/10, respectively); and (5) mucositis was significantly higher in group A patients (8/12), being seen in only one patient in group B and none in the TBI group. The present study has shown that the interval between busulphan and cyclophosphamide administration can negatively affect the pharmacokinetics of cyclophosphamide and its cytotoxic metabolite. We conclude that the timing of CP administration must be considered in order to improve drug efficacy and reduce conditioning-related toxicity.
10805064	Human halothane metabolism, lipid peroxidation, and cytochromes P(450)2A6 and P(450)3A4. Halothane undergoes both oxidative and reductive metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP), respectively causing rare immune-mediated hepatic necrosis and common, mild subclinical hepatic toxicity. Halothane also causes lipid peroxidation in rodents in vitro and in vivo, but in vivo effects in humans are unknown. In vitro investigations have identified a role for human CYPs 2E1 and 2A6 in oxidation and CYPs 2A6 and 3A4 in reduction. The mechanism-based CYP2E1 inhibitor disulfiram diminished human halothane oxidation in vivo. This investigation tested the hypotheses that halothane causes lipid peroxidation in humans in vivo, and that CYP2A6 or CYP3A4 inhibition can diminish halothane metabolism. Patients (n = 9 each group) received single doses of the mechanism-based inhibitors troleandomycin (CYP3A4), methoxsalen (CYP2A6) or nothing (controls) before a standard halothane anaesthetic. Reductive halothane metabolites chlorotrifluoroethane and chlorodifluoroethylene in exhaled breath, fluoride in urine, and oxidative metabolites trifluoroacetic acid and bromide in urine were measured for 48 h postoperatively. Lipid peroxidation was assessed by plasma F2-isoprostane concentrations. The halothane dose was similar in all groups. Methoxsalen decreased 0- to 8-h trifluoroacetic acid (23 +/- 20 micromol vs 116 +/- 78 micromol) and bromide (17 +/- 11 micromol vs 53 +/- 49 micromol) excretion (P < 0.05), but not thereafter. Plasma F2-isoprostanes in controls were increased from 8.5 +/- 4.5 pg/ml to 12.5 +/- 5.0 pg/ml postoperatively (P < 0.05). Neither methoxsalen nor troleandomycin diminished reductive halothane metabolite or F2-isoprostane concentrations. These results provide the first evidence for halothane-dependent lipid peroxidation in humans. Methoxsalen effects on halothane oxidation confirm in vitro results and suggest limited CYP2A6 participation in vivo. CYP2A6-mediated, like CYP2E1-mediated human halothane oxidation, can be inhibited in vivo by mechanism-based CYP inhibitors. In contrast, clinical halothane reduction and lipid peroxidation were not amenable to suppression by CYP inhibitors.
10821401	Simple and rapid determination of irinotecan and its metabolite SN-38 in plasma by high-performance liquid-chromatography: application to clinical pharmacokinetic studies. Irinotecan (CPT-11) is an anticancer agent widely employed in the treatment of colorectal carcinoma. A simple, rapid and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the simultaneous determination of CPT-11 and its metabolite SN-38 in plasma, and their preliminary clinical pharmacokinetics are described. Both deproteinisation of plasma specimens (100 microl) and addition of the internal standard, camptothecin (CPT), are achieved by incorporating to samples 100 microl of a solution of CPT (1 microg/ml) in acetonitrile-1 mM orthophosphoric acid (90:10); 200 microl of this acidified acetonitrile solution, drug-free, is also added to accomplish complete deproteinisation: this procedure reduces sample preparation time to a minimum. After deproteinisation, samples are treated with potassium dihydrogenphosphate (0.1 M) and injected into a Nucleosil C18 (5 microm, 250 x 4.0 mm) column. Mobile phase consists of potassium dihydrogenphosphate (0.1 M)-acetonitrile (67:33), at a flow-rate of 1 ml/min. CPT-11, SN-38 and CPT are detected by fluorescence with excitation wavelength set at 228 nm and emission wavelengths of CPT-11, SN-38 and CPT fixed, respectively, at 450, 543 and 433 nm. The limits of quantitation for CPT-11 and SN-38 are 1.0 and 0.5 ng/ml, respectively. This method shows good precision: the within day relative standard deviation (RSD) for CPT-11 (1-10000 ng/ml) is 5.17% (range 2.15-8.27%) and for SN-38 (0.5-400 ng/ml) is 4.33% (1.32-7.78%); the between-day RSDs for CPT-11 and SN-38, in the previously described ranges, are 6.82% (5.03-10.8%) and 4.94% (2.09-9.30%), respectively. Using this assay, plasma pharmacokinetics of CPT-11, SN-38 and its glucuronidated form, SN-38G, have been determined in one patient receiving 200 mg/m2 of CPT-11 as a 90 min intravenous infusion. The peak plasma concentration of CPT-11 at the end of the infusion is 3800 ng/ml. Plasma decay is biphasic with a terminal half-life of 11.6 h. The volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) is 203 l/m2, and the total body clearance (Cl) is 14.8 l/h x m2. The maximum concentrations of SN-38 and SN-38G reach 28.9 and 151 ng/ml, respectively.
10831022	Single-dose pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate in CYP2D6 extensive and poor metabolizers. Six adults phenotyped as either extensive (N = 4) or poor (N = 2) metabolizers for cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 were given a 10-mg oral dose of methylphenidate (MPH) on two separate occasions with and without quinidine, a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor. Quinidine had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of either MPH or ritalinic acid, its major metabolite, in either group of CYP2D6 metabolizers. These data suggest a lack of involvement of CYP2D6 in the metabolism of MPH. Drugs that are inhibitors of CYP2D6 when taken concurrently with MPH should not affect its plasma concentration.
10839494	Metabolism of styrene by human liver and lung. In mice, styrene is pneumotoxic, and there is some evidence of tumorigenicity. This toxicity is thought to be related to its bioactivation to styrene oxide in lung. To determine if human tissues have this capacity, the metabolism of styrene to styrene oxide was measured in human liver and lung microsomal preparations. Hepatic microsomes metabolized styrene to styrene oxide, but lung microsomes had essentially no activity. However, microsomes from both tissues metabolized benzene to phenol. The data suggest that human lung has low styrene metabolizing activity and may be much less of a target organ than in mouse.
10866914	Low-flow desflurane and sevoflurane anesthesia minimally affect hepatic integrity and function in elderly patients. Hepatic blood flow is reduced in a dose-related manner by all inhaled anesthetics now in use. We assessed hepatic function in elderly patients anesthetized with desflurane or sevoflurane. We measured the cytosolic liver enzyme alpha glutathione S-transferase (alpha GST), the formation of the lidocaine metabolite monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX), and gastric mucosal tonometry-derived variables as sensitive markers of hepatic function and splanchnic perfusion. Thirty patients, 70 to 90 yr old, were allocated randomly to receive desflurane or sevoflurane anesthesia. Anesthetic exposure ranged from 2.1-4.5 minimum alveolar concentration hours. No significant changes in standard liver enzyme markers were seen throughout the study. In both anesthetic groups, tonometric measurements showed a significant decrease from baseline in regional PCO(2), regional to arterial difference in PCO(2), and intramucosal pH at 90 min after skin incision. alpha GST concentrations increased significantly in both groups (desflurane: median peak concentrations 5.8 microg/L [25th, 75th percentile 5.3 microg/L, 7.2 microg/L]; sevoflurane: 7.0 microg/L [5.8 microg/L, 7.3 microg/L]) without showing differences between both anesthetic groups. A return to baseline values in tonometric values and alpha GST levels was seen 24 h postoperatively. MEGX formation did not change significantly after surgery. Median MEGX concentrations postoperatively were 70.0 ng/mL (56.2 ng/mL, 102.0 ng/mL) and 70.0 ng/mL (60.0 ng/mL, 94.2 ng/mL) in the desflurane and sevoflurane groups, respectively. We conclude that, overall, liver function in elderly patients is well preserved during desflurane and sevoflurane anesthesia. Increased serum levels of alpha GST and changes of gastric tonometry-derived variables imply a reduction in splanchnic perfusion, leading to a temporary impairment of hepatocyte oxygenation. We measured the lidocaine metabolite monoethylglycinexylidide, the cytosolic liver enzyme, alpha glutathione S-transferase, and gastric mucosal tonometry-derived variables to evaluate the effects of desflurane and sevoflurane on hepatic function in elderly patients. Liver function was well preserved, whereas increased alpha glutathione S-transferase levels and changes in tonometry-derived variables indicated a reduction in splanchnic blood flow and a temporary impairment of hepatocyte oxygenation for both anesthetics.
10870095	Inhibition of human cytochrome P450 isoforms in vitro by zafirlukast. Zafirlukast is a cysteinyl leukotriene antagonist used to treat allergic and exercise-induced asthma. This in vitro study used human liver microsomes to evaluate the inhibitory activity of zafirlukast versus six human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms. Zafirlukast (0-250 microM) was co-incubated with fixed concentrations of index substrates. Zafirlukast inhibited the hydroxylation of tolbutamide (CYP2C9; mean IC(50)=7.0 microM), triazolam (CYP3A; IC(50)=20.9 microM) and S-mephenytoin (CYP2C19; IC(50)=32.7 microM), and was a less potent inhibitor of phenacetin O-deethylation (CYP1A2; IC(50)=56 microM) and dextromethorphan O-demethylation (CYP2D6; IC(50)=116 microM). Zafirlukast produced negligible inhibition of CYP2E1. In vitro inhibition of CYP2C9 by zafirlukast is consistent with clinical studies showing impaired clearance of S-warfarin and enhanced anti-thrombotic effects, although the in vitro IC(50) value is higher than the usual range of clinically relevant plasma concentrations. Zafirlukast deserves further clinical study as an inhibitor of other CYP2C9 substrates such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, tolbutamide, phenytoin and mestranol. Clinically important inhibition by zafirlukast of other CYP isoforms is not established.
10870985	Prediction of in vivo interaction between triazolam and erythromycin based on in vitro studies using human liver microsomes and recombinant human CYP3A4. To quantitatively predict the in vivo interaction between triazolam and erythromycin, which involves mechanism-based inhibition of CYP3A4, from in vitro studies using human liver microsomes (HLM) and recombinant human CYP3A4 (REC). HLM or REC was preincubated with erythromycin in the presence of NADPH and then triazolam was added. alpha- and 4-hydroxy (OH) triazolam were quantified after a 3 min incubation and the kinetic parameters for enzyme inactivation (k(inact) and K('app)) were obtained. Drug-drug interaction in vivo was predicted based on a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model, using triazolam and erythromycin pharmacokinetic parameters obtained from the literature and kinetic parameters for the enzyme inactivation obtained in the in vitro studies. Whichever enzyme was used, triazolam metabolism was not inhibited without preincubation, even if the erythromycin concentration was increased. The degree of inhibition depended on preincubation time and erythromycin concentration. The values obtained for k(inact) and K('app) were 0.062 min(-1) and 15.9 microM (alpha-OH, HLM), 0.055 min(-1) and 17.4 microM (4-OH, HLM), 0.173 min(-1) and 19.1 microM (alpha-OH, REC), and 0.097 min(-1) and 18.9 microM (4-OH, REC). Based on the kinetic parameters obtained using HLM and REC, the AUCpo of triazolam was predicted to increase 2.0- and 2.6-fold, respectively, following oral administration of erythromycin (333 mg t.i.d. for 3 days), which agreed well with the reported data. In vivo interaction between triazolam and erythromycin was successfully predicted from in vitro data based on a PBPK model involving a mechanism-based inhibition of CYP3A4.
10872592	Determination of enantiomeric amphetamines as metabolites of illicit amphetamines and selegiline in urine by capillary electrophoresis using modified beta-cyclodextrin. The determination of enantiomeric amphetamine and methamphetamine in urine samples is important in order to distinguish use of the prescription drug selegiline (metabolized to R(-)-A and R(-)-MA) from the illicit use of S(+)-A and S(+)-MA. For the analysis of enantiomeric amphetamine (A) and methamphetamine (MA) in biological samples, the optimization of analytical condition was performed by capillary electrophoresis using chiral selectors including beta-cyclodextrin, carboxymethyl-beta-cyclodextrin and 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin. We have examined the factors to obtain the best chiral resolutions, separation efficiency and sensitivity, and wide concentration linearity. Optimum resolutions were achieved using 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 2.5, containing 10 mM of carboxymethyl-beta-cyclodextrin. This method was applied for the quantitative determination of enantiomeric amphetamine and methamphetamine in urine samples obtained from patients taking illicit amphetamines or from rats and patients taking selegiline. Acceptable quantitative results in terms of resolution, precision, sensitivity and linearity were obtained from the real urine samples containing wide-ranging concentrations of A and MA by using two concentrations of internal standards, alpha(+)- (1 microg/ml) and beta-phenylethylamine (50 microg/ml).
10872643	Population pharmacokinetics of levodopa in patients with Parkinson's disease treated with tolcapone. To use pharmacostatistical models to evaluate the overall exposure of patients with Parkinson's disease to levodopa in the presence and absence of tolcapone. Four hundred twelve patients with Parkinson's disease with fluctuating and nonfluctuating responses to levodopa participated in three multicentered, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-finding studies and received either placebo or tolcapone in addition to levodopa-decarboxylase inhibitor therapy. Sparse blood samples were obtained from 393 patients for levodopa and 3-O-methyldopa assay, and the data were analyzed with use of the NONMEM program. The fraction of levodopa metabolized to 3-O-methyldopa was substantially reduced by the co-administration of tolcapone (by 65%, 74%, and 84% with tolcapone doses of 50, 200, and 400 mg, respectively, in fluctuators, and by 50% and 90% with doses of 200 and 400 mg, respectively, in nonfluctuators). This led to an overall reduction in levodopa clearance (CL) of approximately 15% to 25% in fluctuators and 20% to 30% in nonfluctuators. Because this was partly compensated for by a reduction in levodopa dose in these studies, the total daily exposure of patients to levodopa was only slightly increased (11% to 16%). The peak-trough fluctuations of plasma levodopa (Cmax-Cmin) were reduced in both populations in a dose-dependent fashion. Tolcapone effectively inhibited the formation of 3-O-methyldopa and resulted in a decrease in levodopa CL. The consequent increase in levodopa bioavailability was mostly offset by reductions in levodopa dose. It is possible that decreased fluctuations in plasma levodopa concentrations rather than increased levodopa exposure may explain the clinical benefits obtained with tolcapone.
10874125	In vitro metabolism of acitretin by human liver microsomes: evidence of an acitretinoyl-coenzyme A thioester conjugate in the transesterification to etretinate. The aromatic retinoid acitretin is the primary active metabolite of etretinate, and in this study we investigated the ethyl esterification of acitretin to etretinate using [(14)C]acitretin and human liver microsomes. Samples were analysed by TLC, HPLC, and LC-MS. Essential requirements for the transesterification reaction were identified and included viable microsomal protein, ATP, CoASH, and ethanol. Human liver microsomes catalysed formation of acitretinoyl-CoA at the rate of 0.08 +/- 0.02 nmol/min/mg (mean +/- SD, N = 10). Acitretinoyl-CoA was pivotal for the transesterification to etretinate and in the presence of methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, and hexanol, the corresponding esters, namely methyl-, ethyl (etretinate)-, propyl-, butyl-, and hexyl-acitretinate, were formed. On average, 1.7% of the acitretin present in the incubation was converted to etretinate in the presence of ethanol. In the absence of ethanol, transesterification did not proceed. Inhibition of the ester hydrolysis of etretinate by bis-p-nitrophenylphosphate (BNPP, 1 mM) prevented futile cycling of etretinate via acitretinoyl-CoA. An additional finding was that acitretin (15-30 microM) activated significantly human liver microsomal long-chain fatty acid-CoA ligase (E.C.6.2.1.3, LCL), resulting in enhanced formation of palmitoyl-CoA. This study demonstrated that in the presence of ethanol the ethyl esterification of acitretin to etretinate proceeds via formation of acitretinoyl-CoA. Predicting clearance of acitretin in vivo via this unique metabolic pathway will be a challenge, as the intracellular concentration of ethanol could never be predicted with any degree of accuracy in humans.
10895987	Inhibitory effects of silibinin on cytochrome P-450 enzymes in human liver microsomes. Silibinin, the main constituent of silymarin, a flavonoid drug from silybum marianum used in liver disease, was tested for inhibition of human cytochrome P-450 enzymes. Metabolic activities were determined in liver microsomes from two donors using selective substrates. With each substrate, incubations were carried out with and without silibinin (concentrations 3.7-300 microM) at 37 degrees in 0.1 M KH2PO4 buffer containing up to 3% DMSO. Metabolite concentrations were determined by HPLC or direct spectroscopy. First, silibinin IC50 values were determined for each substrate at respective K(M) concentrations. Silibinin had little effect (IC50>200 microM) on the metabolism of erythromycin (CYP3A4), chlorzoxazone (CYP2E1), S(+)-mephenytoin (CYP2C19), caffeine (CYP1A2) or coumarin (CYP2A6). A moderate effect was observed for high affinity dextromethorphan metabolism (CYP2D6) in one of the microsomes samples tested only (IC50=173 microM). Clear inhibition was found for denitronifedipine oxidation (CYP3A4; IC50=29 microM and 46 microM) and S(-)-warfarin 7-hydroxylation (CYP2C9; IC50=43 microM and 45 microM). When additional substrate concentrations were tested to assess enzyme kinetics, silibinin was a potent competitive inhibitor of dextromethorphan metabolism at the low affinity site, which is not CYP2D6 (Ki.c=2.3 microM and 2.4 microM). Inhibition was competitive for S(-)-warfarin 7-hydroxylation (Ki,c=18 microM and 19 microM) and mainly non-competitive for denitronifedipine oxidation (Ki,n=9 microM and 12 microM). With therapeutic silibinin peak plasma concentrations of 0.6 microM and biliary concentrations up to 200 microM, metabolic interactions with xenobiotics metabolised by CYP3A4 or CYP2C9 cannot be excluded.
10901138	Simultaneous determination of thioTEPA, TEPA and a novel, recently identified thioTEPA metabolite, monochloroTEPA, in urine using capillary gas chromatography. An assay for the simultaneous quantitative determination of thioTEPA, TEPA and the recently identified metabolite N,N'-diethylene-N"-2-chloroethylphosphoramide (monochloroTEPA) in human urine has been developed. MonochloroTEPA was synthesized by incubation of TEPA with sodium chloride at pH 8. Thus, with this assay monochloroTEPA is quantified as TEPA equivalents. Analysis of the three analytes in urine was performed using gas chromatography with selective nitrogen-phosphorous detection after extraction with a mixture of 1-propanol and chloroform from urine samples. Diphenylamine was used as internal standard. Recoveries ranged between 70 and 100% and both accuracy and precision were less than 15%. Linearity was accomplished in the range of 25-2500 ng/ml for monochloroTEPA and 25-5000 ng/ml for thioTEPA and TEPA. MonochloroTEPA proved to be stable in urine for at least 4 weeks at -80 degrees C. ThioTEPA, TEPA and monochloroTEPA cummulative urinary excretion from two patients treated with thioTEPA are presented demonstrating the applicability of the assay for clinical samples and that the excreted amount of monochloroTEPA exceeded that of thioTEPA on day 2 to 5 of urine collection.
10901286	Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and phenols glucuronidation in Caco-2 cells: identification of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferases UGT1A6, 1A3 and 2B7. Glucuronidation of phenols (1-naphthol, 4-methylumbelliferone) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ketoprofen, naproxen and carprofen was investigated in human colon carcinoma Caco-2 cell clones. Glucuronidation of these substances was highly effective in microsomes of the clones PD-7 and TC-7, but much lower in the PF-11 clone. The activity increased up to a maximum after 21 days of culture. RT-PCR experiments indicated that the PD-7 and TC-7 clones expressed the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isoforms UGT1A6, UGT1A3 and UGT2B7, which could account for the glucuronidation of phenols and carboxylic acids observed. Beta-naphthoflavone stimulated by 2-fold the enzyme activity toward 1-naphthol in PD-7 and TC-7 clones, but not in PF-11 cells. This increase was parallel to that of the UGT1A6 mRNA level. Glucuronidation of ketoprofen was also sensitive to the inducing effect of beta-naphthoflavone. Actinomycin D and cycloheximide did not affect the induction of UGT1A6 by beta-naphthoflavone, but suppressed that of ketoprofen UGT. The UGT1A3 mRNA content was enhanced by beta-naphthoflavone; by contrast, that of UGT2B7 was insensitive to the inducer. In conclusion, several UGT isoforms of both families 1 and 2, which glucuronidate phenols and carboxylic NSAIDs, have been identified in Caco-2 cells. They are differently sensitive to beta-naphthoflavone.
10907965	Lack of interaction between citalopram and the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam. To determine the effect of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram on plasma levels of triazolam, and to determine the effect of a single dose of triazolam on steady-state levels of citalopram and its major metabolites. Open-label, multidose study. Clinical Studies, Ltd., Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Eighteen healthy male and female volunteers. Subjects received triazolam 0.25 mg alone and another 0.25-mg dose after 4 weeks of citalopram 20 mg/day for 1 week, followed by 3 weeks of citalopram 40 mg/day Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined after single-dose administration of triazolam alone, after administration of citalopram alone at steady state, and after coadministration of the drugs. The pharmacokinetics of triazolam and its metabolite alpha-hydroxytriazolam were unchanged by citalopram coadministration. Triazolam appeared to be absorbed slightly more quickly during coadministration. Citalopram kinetics were unaffected by coadministration. No pharmacokinetic interaction between the drugs was observed, suggesting that triazolam and other cytochrome P450 3A4 substrates can be coadministered safely with citalopram.
10923861	Expression and induction of CYP1A1/1A2, CYP2A6 and CYP3A4 in primary cultures of human hepatocytes: a 10-year follow-up. 1. The aims were to refine experimental conditions (using 76 human hepatocyte preparations) in terms of the selection of enzyme inducers and their optimal concentration, the treatment duration with inducers and the choice of specific cytochrome P450 isoform(s) probes to optimize the use of primary hepatocytes for predicting the potential induction by new chemical entities of cytochrome P450 isoforms in vivo in man. 2. In the absence of any inducer, basal cytochrome P450 isoform(s)-mediated activities decreased to 20% of their initial activity (end of the seeding period) by 72-96 h. In contrast, UGT-dependent enzyme activities remained at a constant level (+/- 20%) up to the fifth day of culture. 3. Beta-naphthoflavone, at an optimal concentration of 50 microM and after a 3-day treatment, specifically and potently induced 7-ethoxyresorufin (10.4 +/- 10.4-fold, n = 74) and phenacetin (6.6 +/- 6.4-fold, n = 60) O-deethylation processes, markers for CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 isoforms respectively. Only a 2-fold increase was noted following treatment with 2 mM phenobarbitone, whereas dexamethasone and rifampicin had no effect at all. 4. A 3-day treatment of human hepatocytes with 50 microM dexamethasone was associated with a major induction of both coumarin 7-hydroxylation (9.4 +/- 11.4-fold, n = 49) and nifedipine dehydrogenation (4.7 +/- 3.8-fold, n = 61), markers for CYP2A6 and CYP3A4 respectively. Phenobarbitone, however, exhibited a broad but moderate inducing effect on 7-ethoxyresorufin (2.2 +/- 1.5-fold, n = 55) and phenacetin (1.7 +/- 0.9-fold, n = 54) O-deethylation, coumarin 7-hydroxylation (3.9 +/- 9.2-fold, n = 50) and nifedipine dehydrogenation (2.1 +/- 2.0-fold, n = 47). 5. Km obtained for the different cytochrome P450 isoform substrates in untreated hepatocytes were in the same range of magnitude that those determined on human hepatic microsomal fractions. Enzyme induction processes were characterized by a large increase in apparent Vmax whereas apparent Km were not affected. 6. These studies demonstrate that human hepatocytes in primary culture can respond specifically and quantitatively to model inducers. This in vitro system offers a useful approach to study the regulation of human hepatic biotransformation activities and should facilitate the demand for a reproducible method for addressing cytochrome P450 induction.
10934669	Variable absorption of carbidopa affects both peripheral and central levodopa metabolism. Carbidopa (CD), a competitive inhibitor of aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase that does not cross the blood-brain barrier, is routinely administered with levodopa (LD) to patients with Parkinson disease (PD) to reduce the peripheral decarboxylation of LD to dopamine. Using a stable isotope-labeled form of LD, the authors examined in 9 PD patients the effects of variable CD absorption on peripheral and central LD metabolism. Subjects were administered orally 50 mg of CD followed in 1 hour by a slow bolus intravenous infusion of 150 mg stable isotope-labeled LD (ring 1',2',3',4',5',6'-13C). Eight patients underwent a lumbar puncture 6 hours following the infusion. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were analyzed for labeled and unlabeled metabolites using a combination of high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. When patients were divided into "slow" and "rapid" CD absorption groups, significantly greater peripheral LD decarboxylation (as measured by area under the curve [AUC]-labeled serum HVA) was noted in the poor absorbers (p = 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test). Elimination half-lives for serum LD did not differ between groups, suggesting a further capacity for decarboxylation inhibition in the "rapid" absorbers. A significant correlation between AUC serum CD and percent-labeled HVA in CSF was found for all patients (R = 0.786, p = 0.02). "Rapid" as compared to "slow" CD absorbers had significantly more percent-labeled CSF HVA (60 vs. 49, p = 0.02, Mann-Whitney U test), indicating greater central-labeled DA production in the better CD absorbers. The data suggest that peripheral aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase activity is not saturated at CD doses used in current practice. The authors believe that future studies to better examine a dose dependence of CD on peripheral LD decarboxylation and LD brain uptake are warranted.
10934671	Pharmacokinetics of ofloxacin enantiomers after intravenous administration for antibiotic prophylaxis in biliary surgery. The pharmacokinetics of S-(-)- and R-(+)-ofloxacin, enantiomers of the fluoroquinolone ofloxacin, were characterized after prophylactic administration in 15 patients undergoing elective biliary surgery. A single dose of ofloxacin 400 mg given intravenously as an infusion was administered 1 hour before surgery. Plasma levels of S-(-)- and R-(+)-ofloxacin showed very small differences between both enantiomers, although the ratio of S-(-)- to R-(+)-enantiomer concentration in plasma showed significant differences (p < 0.05) at 4 and 12 hours. Adequate S-(-)-ofloxacin (levofloxacin, the active enantiomer) plasma levels (> or = minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC90] for Escherichia coli) were found throughout the procedure. For pharmacokinetic parameters, the authors found small but statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) in the area under the concentration-time curve, AUC0-infinity (22.30 +/- 2.72 mg h/L for S-(-)-ofloxacin vs. 20.50 +/- 2.06 mg h/L for R-(+)-ofloxacin), and in the clearance (0.15 +/- 0.04 L/h/Kg for S-(-)-ofloxacin vs. 0.16 +/- 0.04 L/h/Kg for R-(+)-ofloxacin). To test the penetration of ofloxacin enantiomers into tissues, the authors measured levels in subcutaneous cell tissue and gall-bladder cell tissue. They did not observe statistical differences between the two isomers, which means that distribution is not an estereoselective process. Enantiomer levels in these two tissues decreased rapidly, but the highest concentrations were reached during the 4 first hours (i.e., when the surgical procedure was being performed). In conclusion, with the prophylactic treatment used, levofloxacin plasma and tissue levels are high enough to prevent surgical infections.
10954350	Methylation of 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine by thiopurine S-methyltransferase. A comparison of activity in red blood cell samples of 199 blood donors. To compare 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and 6-thioguanine (6-TG) as substrates for the methylation reaction catalysed by the enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT). TPMT activity in haemolysed red blood cells of healthy blood donors was determined twice, using the same experimental setting and equal molar concentrations of 6-TG and 6-MP as substrates. After extraction, the reaction products 6-methyl-TG and 6-methyl-MP were quantified using specific high-performance liquid chromatography procedures. The medians of the TPMT activities from 199 blood donors were 54.4 nmol 6-MTG g(-1)Hb h(-1) when measured with 6-TG as the substrate and 35.8 nmol 6-MMP g(-1) Hb h(-1) when measured with 6-MP. The correlation coefficient for the 199 pairs of values was 0.8695. On average, TPMT activity was 34% lower with 6-MP as substrate than with 6-TG as substrate.
10956067	N-Acetylbenzidine-DNA adduct formation by phorbol 12-myristate-stimulated human polymorphonuclear neutrophils. N'-(3'-Monophosphodeoxyguanosin-8-yl)-N-acetylbenzidine (dGp-ABZ) is the major adduct in exfoliated urothelial cells and in peripheral white blood cells of workers exposed to benzidine. This study was designed to assess the metabolic pathways leading to dGp-ABZ formation in human peripheral white blood cells. [(3)H]-N-Acetylbenzidine (ABZ) transformation was assessed using myeloperoxidase (MPO), hypochlorous acid (HOCl), and human peripheral white blood cells in the absence and presence of DNA or dGp. MPO metabolism required H(2)O(2), but not NaCl. While transformation by HOCl was completely inhibited by 10 mM taurine, the level of metabolism of ABZ by MPO was only reduced 56%. Transformation by either MPO or HOCl was inhibited by 100 mM DMPO, 1 mM glutathione, and 1 mM ascorbic acid. Glutathione formed a new product with MPO, but not with HOCl. Previously identified oxidation products of ABZ, N'-hydroxy-N-acetylbenzidine or 4'-nitro-4-acetylaminobiphenyl, were not detected. With DNA or dGp present, a new product was observed that corresponded to synthetic dGp-ABZ in its HPLC elution profile, in nuclease P(1) hydrolysis to dG-ABZ, and in (32)P-postlabeling analysis. The HOCl-derived adduct was identified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, with collision-activated dissociation, as dGp-ABZ. Metabolism of [(3)H]ABZ by peripheral blood cells was stimulated about 3-fold with 30 ng/mL beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Using (32)P-postlabeling, dGp-ABZ was detected only in the presence of PMA and its level was increased more than 300-fold if either 0.7 mg/mL DNA or dGp was present. Indomethacin (0.1 mM) did not alter adduct formation. With dGp, dGp-ABZ formation could be detected with as little as 0.12 x 10(6) neutrophils. Using specific chromatographic and enzymatic techniques, neutrophil-derived dGp-ABZ was identical to the synthetic standard. Thus, these results are consistent with human polymorphonuclear neutrophils forming dGp-ABZ by a peroxidatic mechanism involving MPO.
10972481	Reduction of cyclophosphamide bioactivation by thioTEPA: critical sequence-dependency in high-dose chemotherapy regimens. Cyclophosphamide and thioTEPA are frequently used simultaneously in high-dose chemotherapy regimens. During a pharmacokinetic study of 31 courses in 20 patients of cyclophosphamide and its activated metabolite 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide given in the combination cyclophosphamide thioTEPA carboplatin, a sharp decrease in 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide concentration was observed immediately after the start of the thioTEPA infusion. A drug-drug interaction was suspected. This putative interaction was investigated in this study. Possible sequence dependency, due to inhibition of the formation of 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide by thioTEPA, was investigated by altering the sequence of infusion in three patients (four courses) receiving high-dose chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide (1,000 or 1,500 mg/m2 per day), thioTEPA (80 or 120 mg/m2 per day) and carboplatin (265 or 400 mg/m2 per day) in short infusions for four consecutive days. The pharmacokinetics of cyclophosphamide and 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide were established. Possible inhibition of the metabolism of cyclophosphamide and thioTEPA was investigated in human microsomes. A striking sequence dependency of the pharmacokinetics of 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide was observed. Administration of thioTEPA 1 h prior to cyclophosphamide resulted in decreased Cmax (-62%) and AUC (-26%) values of 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide compared to those of thioTEPA administered 1 h after cyclophosphamide. In human microsomes an inhibition of the conversion of cyclophosphamide to 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide by thioTEPA was observed at clinically relevant concentrations with an IC50 of 23 microM. No inhibition of the formation of TEPA by cyclophosphamide was observed. ThioTEPA strongly inhibits the bioactivation of cyclophosphamide and this may decrease both efficacy and toxicity. Our results seriously question the practice of the simultaneous continuous infusion of cyclophosphamide and thioTEPA and suggest that the sequencing and scheduling of these two agents in high-dose chemotherapy regimens may be of critical importance.
10976551	Quinidine as a probe for CYP3A4 activity: intrasubject variability and lack of correlation with probe-based assays for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. In vitro studies have shown that the formation of 3-hydroxyquinidine from quinidine is catalyzed almost exclusively by CYP3A4. In vivo this result has been supported in various interaction studies, and the use of this reaction as an in vivo biomarker reaction of CYP3A4 activity has been suggested. We studied the possible correlation of the formation clearance of 3-hydroxyquinidine with probe-based assays for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. Descriptive analyses of the outcome of various biomarker reactions were performed. Forty-two healthy, young male volunteers participated in an open study consisting of two identical test periods separated by a 12- to 14-week washout period. In each period biomarker reactions of CYP1A2 (caffeine), CYP2C9 (tolbutamide), CYP2C19 (mephenytoin), CYP2D6 (sparteine), CYP3A4 (urinary excretion of 6beta-hydroxycortisol), as well as the pharmacokinetics of quinidine after a 200-mg single oral dose of quinidine sulfate were studied. The median formation clearance of 3-hydroxyquinidine were 2.40 and 2.33 L/h in the two test periods. As measured by the formation clearance of 3-hydroxyquinidine, the intraindividual coefficient of variation for CYP3A4 activity was 18%, whereas the interindividual activity varied fourfold. The formation clearance of 3-hydroxyquinidine did not correlate with the outcome of indexes for activities of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 or the urinary excretion of 6beta-hydroxycortisol. The formation clearance of 3-hydroxyquinidine correlated well to point values of 3-hydroxyquinidine to quinidine ratios in plasma and urine. The formation clearance of 3-hydroxyquinidine after a single oral dose of 200 mg quinidine sulfate may represent a useful index of CYP3A4 activity in vivo.
10985967	Human term placental lipoxygenase-mediated N-demethylation of phenothiazines and insecticides in the presence of linoleic acid. This study investigated the hypothesis that human term placental lipoxygenase (HTPLO) and soybean lipoxygenase (SLO) are capable of mediating N-demethylation of selected phenothiazines and insecticides in the presence of linoleic acid (LA). In addition to being LA dependent, the N-demethylation reaction mediated by HTPLO and SLO was limited by incubation time, pH of the medium, concentration of the enzyme and the substrate. Using Nash reagent to monitor formaldehyde production, the specific activity for LA-dependent N-demethylation of chlorpromazine, a model phenothiazine, was determined to be 1.7+/-0.3 nmoles/min/mg HTPLO. Besides chlorpromazine, N-demethylation of promazine, promethazine and trimeprazine was also observed. The insecticide, aminocarb, displayed a specific activity of 2.2+/-0.3 nmoles/min/mg HTPLO for N-demethylation. Other insecticides, namely chlordimeform, dicrotophos and zectran, were oxidized in a similar manner. As compared with HTPLO, the rates of N-demethylation of phenothiazines and insecticides mediated by SLO were higher. Classical inhibitors of lipoxygenase, as well as antioxidants and free radical scavengers, caused a dose-dependent reduction in the production of formaldehyde from chlorpromazine and aminocarb by HTPLO. These results clearly demonstrate the ability of polyunsaturated free fatty acids to support N-demethylation of xenobiotics via the lipoxygenase pathway.
10993521	Quantitation of loperamide and N-demethyl-loperamide in human plasma using electrospray ionization with selected reaction ion monitoring liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. We report here the development and validation of an LC-MS method for quantitation of loperamide (LOP) and its N-demethyl metabolite (DMLOP) in human plasma. O-Acetyl-loperamide (A-LOP) was synthesized by us for use as an internal standard in the assay. After addition of the internal standard, the compounds of interest were extracted with methyl tert.-butylether and separated by HPLC on a C18 reversed-phase column using an acetonitrile-water gradient containing 20 mM ammonium acetate. The three compounds were well separated by HPLC and no interfering peaks were detected at the usual concentrations found in plasma. Analytes were quantitated using positive electrospray ionization in a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in the MS-MS mode. Selected reaction monitoring was used to quantify LOP (m/z 477-266), DMLOP (m/z 463-->252) and A-LOP (m/z 519-->266) on ions formed by loss of the 4-(p-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxy-piperidyl group upon low energy collision-induced dissociation. Calibration curves, which were linear over the range 1.04 to 41.7 pmol/ml (LOP) and 1.55 to 41.9 pmol/ml (DMLOP), were run contemporaneously with each batch of samples, along with low (4.2 pmol/ml), medium (16.7 pmol/ml) and high (33.4 pmol/ml) quality control samples. The lower limit of quantitation (LLQ) of LOP and DMLOP was about 0.25 pmol/ml in plasma. The extraction efficiency of LOP and DMLOP from human plasma was 72.3+/-1.50% (range: 70.7-73.7%) and 79.4+/-12.8% (64.9-88.8%), respectively. The intra- and inter-assay variability of LOP and DMLOP ranged from 2.1 to 14.5% for the low, medium and high quality control samples. The method has been used successfully to study loperamide pharmacokinetics in adult humans.
11001387	Characterization of CPT-11 converting carboxylesterase activity in colon tumor and normal tissues: comparison with p-nitro-phenylacetate converting carboxylesterase activity. Irinotecan (CPT-11) is a topoisomerase I inhibitor commonly used in the treatment of colorectal tumors. It is a prodrug, converted to an active metabolite, SN-38, by carboxylesterases (CEs). CEs are ubiquitary enzymes that react with numerous substrates. A specific CPT-11 converting enzyme was isolated from rat serum, with different kinetic properties than other CEs. We determined kinetic properties of specific CPT-11 CE activity (CPT-CE) in human normal liver and colon tumors. Km were very similar (3.4 microM in liver and 3.8 microM in colon tumors), but Vmax was higher in liver (2.7 pmol/min/mg protein) than in colon tumor (1.7 pmol/min/mg protein). CPT-CE and total CE (using p-nitro-phenylacetate as substrate) were weakly correlated in colon tumors. The large interpatient variability observed in liver CPT-CE activity could play a potential role in the pharmacokinetic variability observed with irinotecan.
11007345	Urinary methanol and formic acid as indicators of occupational exposure to methyl formate. To evaluate the validity of methanol (MeOH) and formic acid (FA) in urine as biological indicators of methyl formate (MF) exposure in experimental and field situations. The subjects were 28 foundrymen and two groups of volunteers (20 control and 20 exposed). Exposure assessment of the workers was performed by personal air and biological monitoring. Methyl formate vapour collected on charcoal tube was analysed by gas chromatography. The concentration of MF in the exposure chamber (volunteer-study) was monitored by two independent methods [flame ionisation detection (FID) and Fourier transformation infra-red detection (FTIR)]. Urinary metabolites (MeOH and FA) were analysed separately by headspace gas chromatography. The volunteers exposed to 100 ppm MF vapour at rest for 8 h excreted 3.62 +/- 1.13 mg MeOH/l (mean +/- SD) at the end of the exposure. This was statistically different (P < 0.001) from pre-exposure MeOH excretion (2.15 +/- 0.80 mg/1), or from that of controls (1.69 +/- 0.48 mg/l). The urinary FA excretion was 32.2 +/- 11.3 mg/g creatinine after the exposure, which was statistically different (P < 0.001) from pre-exposure excretion (18.0 +/- 9.3 mg/g creatinine) or that of controls (13.8 +/- 7.9 mg/g creatinine). In foundrymen, the urinary FA excretion after the 8 h workshift exposure to a time weighted average (TWA) concentration of 2 to 156 ppm MF showed a dose-dependent increase best modelled by a polynomial function. The highest urinary FA concentration was 129 mg/g creatinine. The pre-shift urinary FA of the foundrymen (18.3 +/- 5.6 mg/g creatinine) did not differ from that of controls (13.8 +/- 7.9 mg/g creatinine). The urinary MeOH excretion of the foundrymen after the shift, varied from < 1 to 15.4 mg/l, while the correlation with the preceding MF exposure was poor. The foundrymen excreted more (P = 0.01) FA (2.12 +/- 3.56 mg/g creatinine) after the workshift than experimentally, once-exposed volunteers (0.32 +/- 0.11 mg/g creatinine) at a similar inhaled MF level of 1 ppm). In spite of its high background level in non-exposed subjects, urinary FA seems to be a useful biomarker of methyl formate exposure. The question remains as to what is the reason for the differences in chronic and acute exposure respectively.
1101753	Urinary metabolites of halothane in man. The urinary metabolites of halothane (2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane) were investigated in five individuals given trace doses (25 muCi), and in three individuals given large doses (1 mCi) of radioactively labeled 14C-halothane. The latter were donor subjects for heart transplant operations. Separation of the nonvolatile urinary metabolites of halothane was accomplished by chemical extraction, electrophoresis, ion-exchange and high-pressure liquid chromatography, and gas chromatography. Identification of the individual metabolites was by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry. Three major metabolites were identified: trifluoroacetic acid, N-trifluoroacetyl-2-aminoethanol, and N-acetyl-S-(2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1-difluoroethyl)-L-cysteine. Smaller unidentified radioactive peaks were also found. The presence of both ethanolamide and cysteine conjugates of halothane is of concern. These urinary products imply the presence of reactive intermediates. The conjugation of such intermediates to proteins and phospholipids may give rise to the high-molecular-weight covalently bound metabolites demonstrated to be present in the liver following halothane anesthesia. Elucidation of the structures of the urinary metabolites provides information important to an understanding of halothane metabolism and its potential hepatotoxicity.
11026737	Cytochrome P-450 enzymes and FMO3 contribute to the disposition of the antipsychotic drug perazine in vitro. Perazine (PER) is a phenothiazine antipsychotic drug frequently used in Germany that undergoes extensive metabolism. To anticipate metabolic drug interactions and to explore the relevance of polymorphisms of metabolic enzymes, perazine-N-demethylation and perazine-N-oxidation were investigated in vitro using human liver microsomes and cDNA expressed enzymes. CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 were identified as the major enzymes mediating PER-N-demethylation. At 10 microM PER, a concentration consistent with anticipated in vivo liver concentrations, CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 contributed 50% and 35%, respectively, to PER-N-demethylation. With increasing PER concentrations, contribution of CYP2C9 decreased and CYP3A4 became more important. In human liver microsomes, PER-N-demethylation was inhibited by ketoconazole (>40%) and sulfaphenazole (16%). Allelic variants of recombinant CYP2C9 showed differences in PER-N-demethylase activity. The wild type allele CYP2C9*1 was the most active variant. Maximal activities of CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 were 88% and 18%, respectively, compared to the wild type activity. Perazine-N-oxidation was mainly mediated by FMO3. In the absence of NADPH, heat treatment of microsomes abolished PER-N-oxidase activity. Methimazole inhibited PER-N-oxidation, while CYP specific inhibitors had no inhibitory effect. Perazine is a potent inhibitor of dextromethorphan-O-demethylase, S-mephenytoin-hydroxylase, alprazolam-4-hydroxylase, phenacetin-O-deethylase and tolbutamide-hydroxylase activity in human liver microsomes. Alterations in the activity of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and FMO3 through genetic polymorphisms, enzyme induction or inhibition bear the potential to cause clinically significant changes in perazine clearance. PER may alter the clearance of coadministered compounds metabolized by CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2.
11030450	Pharmacokinetics of cyclophosphamide (CP) and 4-OH-CP/aldophosphamide in systemic vasculitis. Cyclophosphamide given in association with corticosteroids has markedly improved the prognosis of systemic vasculitis. Little information has been reported on cyclophosphamide pharmacokinetics in these diseases and data evaluating its metabolite, 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide/aldophosphamide, pharmacokinetics and concentrations are lacking. Cyclophosphamide was administered as a 1-h intravenous infusion every 3 weeks for six cycles to ten vasculitis patients. Serum cyclophosphamide and 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide/aldophosphamide concentrations were assayed on the first cycle of the treatment by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. The mean (+/- SD) 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide/aldophosphamide and cyclophosphamide areas under the serum concentration-time curves were, respectively, 1.86 +/- 1.12 and 154.1 +/- 62.7 mg/L x h with a ratio of 1.30 +/- 0.76%. The mean maximum serum 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide/aldophosphamide was reached 2.3 h after cyclophosphamide administration. The mean (+/- SD) cyclophosphamide and 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide/aldophosphamide half-lives were, respectively, 5.5 +/- 3.1 and 7.6 +/- 2.3 h. The results are consistent with those obtained for cancer patients, in spite of a wide interpatient variability of concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters.
11034785	Distinct Effect of Benzalkonium Chloride on the Esterase and Aryl Acylamidase Activities of Butyrylcholinesterase. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) from vertebrates, other than their predominant acylcholine hydrolase (esterase) activity, display a genuine aryl acylamidase activity (AAA) capable of hydrolyzing the synthetic substrate o-nitroacetanilide to o-nitroaniline. This AAA activity is strongly inhibited by classical cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitors. In the present study, benzalkonium chloride (BAC), a cationic detergent widely used as a preservative in pharmaceutical preparations, has been shown to distinctly modulate the esterase and AAA activities of BChEs. The detergent BAC was able to inhibit the esterase activity of human serum and horse serum BChEs and AChEs from electric eel and human erythrocyte. The remarkable property of BAC was its ability to profoundly activate the AAA activity of human serum and horse serum BChEs but not the AAA activity of AChEs. Thus BAC seem to preferentially activate the AAA activity of BChEs alone. Results of the study using the ChE active site-specific inhibitor diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate indicated that BAC binds to the active site of ChEs. Furthermore, studies using a structural homolog of BAC indicated that the alkyl group of BAC is essential not only for its interaction with ChEs but also for its distinct effect on the esterase and AAA activities of BChEs. This is the first report of a compound that inhibits the esterase activity, while simultaneously activating the AAA activity, of BChEs. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.
11043672	Loxapine intoxication: case report and literature review. Loxapine is a dibenzoxazepine tricyclic compound used to treat schizophrenia in the United States since 1976. Metabolism includes demethylation to its primary metabolite, amoxapine. There are few documented reports of the disposition of loxapine in deaths due to overdose. This report discusses the overdose suicide of a 69-year-old white female found dead in her home by her husband. A prescription for loxapine (50-mg capsules) was found near the body. An autopsy was performed and heart blood, bile, vitreous humor, and gastric contents were submitted for toxicological analysis. The blood specimen was subjected to comprehensive testing that included volatile analysis by headspace gas chromatography (GC); acidic/neutral and basic drug screening by GC; benzodiazepine screening by high-performance liquid chromatography; opiate screening by modified immunoassay; and acetaminophen, salicylate, and ethchlorvynol screening by colorimetry. Loxapine and amoxapine were detected in the basic drug screen. No other drugs were detected in the case specimens. The respective concentrations of loxapine and amoxapine in each specimen were as follows: heart blood, 9.5 and 0.6 mg/L; bile, 28.8 and 4.7 mg/L; gastric, 278 mg/L and negative; and vitreous, 1.5 mg/L and negative. A review of the literature showed that the heart blood concentration of loxapine measured in this case was the highest reported to date. Based on the autopsy findings, patient history, and toxicology results, the cause of death was determined to be acute intoxication of loxapine and the manner, suicide.
11043753	Simple and selective determination of the cyclophosphamide metabolite phosphoramide mustard in human plasma using high-performance liquid chromatography. A simple and selective assay for the determination of the alkylating cyclophosphamide metabolite phosphoramide mustard (PM) in plasma was developed and validated. PM was determined after derivatisation by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet detection at 276 nm. Sample pre-treatment consisted of derivatisation of PM with diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC) at 70 degrees C for 10 min, followed by extraction with acetonitrile in the presence of 0.7 M sodium chloride. Phase separation occurred due to the high salt content of the aqueous phase. The HPLC system consisted of a C8 column with acetonitrile-0.025 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, (32:68, v/v) as the mobile phase. The entire sample handling procedure, from collection at the clinical ward until analysis in the laboratory, was optimised and validated. Calibration curves were linear from 50 to 10,000 ng/ml. The lower limit of quantification and the limit of detection (using a signal-to-noise ratio of 3) were 50 and 40 ng/ml, respectively, using 500 microl of plasma. Within-day and between-day precisions were below 11% over the entire concentration range and the accuracies were between 100 and 106%. PM was found to be stable at -30 degrees C for at least 10 weeks both in plasma and as a DDTC-derivative in a dry sample. A pharmacokinetic pilot study in two patients receiving 1,000 mg/m2 CP in a 1-h infusion demonstrated the applicability of the assay.
11069439	Pharmacokinetics of SDZ RAD and cyclosporin including their metabolites in seven kidney graft patients after the first dose of SDZ RAD. The aim of the study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of the new immunosuppressant SDZ RAD during concomitant therapy with cyclosporin in stable renal transplant patients. Furthermore, we studied the influence of SDZ RAD on the pharmacokinetics of cyclosporin at steady state levels. SDZ RAD was administered orally in different doses (0.25-15 mg day-1) to seven patients, who were on standard cyclosporin-based immunosuppression. The blood concentrations of both drugs including their main groups of metabolites were measured simultaneously by LC/electrospray-mass spectrometry. The mean area under the blood concentration-time curve to 12 h (AUC(0,12 h)) was 4244 +/- 1311 microg l-1 h for cyclosporin before SDZ RAD treatment and 4683 +/- 1174 microg l-1 h (P = 0.106) on the day of SDZ RAD treatment (95% CI for difference -126, 1003). On both study days Cmax, and tmax of cyclosporin were not significantly different. The metabolite pattern of cyclosporin did not change. The pharmacokinetic data of SDZ RAD dose-normalized to 1 mg SDZ RAD were as follows: AUC(0,24 h): 35.4 +/- 13.1 microg l-1 h, Cmax: 7.9 +/- 2.7 microg l-1 and tmax: 1.5 +/- 0.9 h. The metabolites of SDZ RAD found in blood were hydroxy-SDZ RAD, dihydroxy-SDZ RAD, demethyl-SDZ RAD, and a ring-opened form of SDZ RAD. A single dose of SDZ RAD did not influence significantly the pharmacokinetics of cyclosporin. The most important metabolite of SDZ RAD was the hydroxy-SDZ RAD, its AUC(0,24 h) being nearly half that of the parent compound SDZ RAD.
11100951	Air and biological monitoring of solvent exposure during graffiti removal. The principal aim of the study was to estimate the level of exposure to organic solvents of graffiti removers, and to identify the chemicals used in different cleaning agents. A secondary objective was to inform about the toxicity of various products and to optimise working procedures. Exposure to organic solvents was determined by active air sampling and biological monitoring among 38 graffiti removers during an 8-h work shift in the Stockholm underground system. The air samples and biological samples were analysed by gas chromatography. Exposure to organic solvents was also assessed by a questionnaire and interviews. Solvents identified were N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether (DPGME), propylene glycol monomethyl ether (PGME), diethylene glycol monoethyl ether (DEGEE), toluene, xylene, pseudocumene, hemimellitine, mesitylene, ethylbenzene, limonene, nonane, decane, undecane, hexandecane and gamma-butyrolactone. The 8-h average exposures [time-weighted average (TWA)] were below 20% of the Swedish permissible exposure limit value (PEL) for all solvents identified. In poorly ventilated spaces, e.g. in elevators etc., the short-term exposures exceeded occasionally the Swedish short-term exposure limit values (STEL). The blood and urine concentrations of NMP and its metabolites were low. Glycol ethers and their metabolites (2-methoxypropionic acid (MPA), ethoxy acetic acid (EAA), butoxy acetic acid (BAA), and 2-(2-methoxyethoxy) acetic acid (MEAA)) were found in low concentrations in urine. There were significant correlation between the concentrations of NMP in air and levels of NMP and its metabolites in blood and urine. The use of personal protective equipment, i.e. gloves and respirators, was generally high. Many different cleaning agents were used. The average exposure to solvents was low, but some working tasks included relatively high short-term exposure. To prevent adverse health effects, it is important to inform workers about the health risks and to restrict the use of the most toxic chemicals. Furthermore, it is important to develop good working procedures and to encourage the use of personal protection equipment.
11115505	Role of multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) and glutathione S-transferase A1-1 in alkylating agent resistance. Kinetics of glutathione conjugate formation and efflux govern differential cellular sensitivity to chlorambucil versus melphalan toxicity. We investigated the role of phase II (conjugation) and phase III (efflux) detoxification of the anticancer drugs melphalan (MLP) and chlorambucil (CHB). Although both drugs are substrates of Alpha-class glutathione S-transferases (GST) and the monoglutathionyl conjugates formed in these enzymatic reactions are transported by MRP1, we found that GSTA1-1 and MRP1 acted in synergy to confer resistance to CHB but not to MLP (Morrow, C. S., Smitherman, P. K., Diah, S. K., Schneider, E., and Townsend, A. J. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 20114-20120). To explain this selectivity of MRP1/GST-mediated resistance, we report results of side-by-side experiments comparing the kinetics of MLP- versus CHB-glutathione conjugate: formation, product inhibition of GSTA1-1 catalysis, and transport by MRP1. The monoglutathionyl conjugate of CHB, CHB-SG, is a very strong competitive inhibitor of GSTA1-1 (K(i) 0.14 microM) that is >30-fold more potent than that of the corresponding conjugate of MLP, MLP-SG (K(i) 4.7 microM). The efficiency of GSTA1-1-mediated monoglutathionyl conjugate formation is more than 4-fold higher for CHB than MLP. Lastly, both CHB-SG and MLP-SG are efficiently transported by MRP1 with similar V(max) although the K(m) for CHB-SG (0.37 microm) is significantly lower than for MLP-SG (1.1 microM). These results indicate that MRP1 is required for GSTA1-1-mediated resistance to CHB in order to relieve potent product inhibition of the enzyme by intracellular CHB-SG formed. The kinetic properties of MRP1 are well suited to eliminate CHB-SG at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. For MLP detoxification, where product inhibition of GSTA1-1 is less important, GSTA1-1 does not confer resistance because of the relatively poorer catalytic efficiency of MLP-SG formation. Similar analyses can be useful for predicting the pharmacological and toxicological consequences of MRP and GST expression on cellular sensitivity to various other electrophilic xenobiotics.
11116751	The effect of diflunisal on the elimination of triamterene in human volunteers. A major metabolic pathway for triamterene (a potassium sparing diuretic) is aromatic hydroxylation followed by sulphate conjugation. Diflunisal (a salicylate anti-inflammatory agent) also undergoes sulphate conjugation of its phenolic group as a major pathway. We investigated the possible effect of diflunisal on the elimination of triamterene (competition for phenolic sulphonation) in six healthy volunteers by studying the disposition of single doses of triamterene (100 mg) taken alone and in the presence of steady-state levels of diflunisal. Diflunisal coadministration (500 mg b.i.d.) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of triamterene itself. However, plasma AUC of p-hydroxytriamterene sulphate was greater (4.6 times), and its renal clearance lower (0.24 times), in the presence of diflunisal. There was no change in the formation clearance or protein binding of p-hydroxytriamterene sulphate in the presence of diflunisal. The data point to competition for renal excretory pathways rather than sulphonation capacity. This interaction could have clinical relevance since p-hydroxytriamterene sulphate is pharmacologically active.
11118747	Blood concentrations of tetracaine and its metabolite following spinal anesthesia. Blood concentrations of tetracaine and its metabolite, p-butylaminobenzoic acid, were measured after spinal anesthesia with tetracaine which had been administered to patients under going orthopedic surgery. Tetracaine, an ester anesthetic, was given to 10 patients, the dose was 8-14mg, and blood samples were collected 1, 2 and 6h after the injection of tetracaine. We used gas chromatography/mass spectrometry for purposes of analysis. Tetracaine was not detected in any blood sample, but the metabolite was detected in each sample with the mean concentrations of 126.5, 97.9 and 43.3ng/ml at 1, 2 and 6h, respectively. This data will be useful in determination of the cause of death after spinal anesthesia with tetracaine.
11128238	Population pharmacokinetics of clomipramine, desmethylclomipramine, and hydroxylated metabolites in patients with depression receiving chronic treatment: model evaluation. Because metabolites play a major role in the clinical response to clomipramine, the objective of the current study was to develop a population model and evaluate its performance to describe the pharmacokinetic profiles of clomipramine (C) and its active metabolites desmethylclomipramine (DC), 8-hydroxy-clomipramine (OHC) and 8-hydroxy-desmethylclomipramine (OHDC). A first sample of 14 patients served for development of a 2-molecule C and DC model, which was shown to provide reasonable estimates of AUC-based clearances, as well as precise estimation of interindividual variability. Simulated data, generated to mimic a semi-rich sampling design and chronic treatment with clomipramine, indicated that clearance estimation was feasible under routine treatment conditions. A second sample of 30 patients, recruited prospectively and followed for a median 4-week period, was used to extend the 2-molecule model to a 4-molecule model. Goodness-of-fit assessment revealed that model-predicted concentrations were reasonably close to observed concentrations for a majority of patients. Interindividual variability was 50% to 60% for hydroxylation and desmethylation clearances, and residual variability was 30%. The proposed model incorporates much of what is known about the metabolism of clomipramine and may valuably integrate the influence of genetic and environmental factors on each metabolic pathway.
14738594	Study of inhibition of CYP2A6 by some drugs derived from quinoline. CYP2A6 metabolizes coumarin to 7-hydroxycoumarin showing fluorescence, as measured by fluorometry. Firstly, we measured the inhibition of coumarin 7-hydroxylase of cDNA-expressed human CYP2A6 and in bovine liver microsomes, by quinoline and fluoroquinolines (FQ). Quinoline, 5-FQ, 6-FQ and 8-FQ inhibited activity but 3-FQ showed little inhibition. This suggests that the position 3 of quinoline is a recognition site for CYP2A6. We found similar patterns of coumarin 7-hydroxylase activity with human pooled liver microsomes. The level of CYP2A6 in human and bovine microsomes is the same as that detected by immunological titration with monoclonal antibody against CYP2A6. Secondly, we studied the inhibition of CYP2A6 with clinically used drugs of quinoline compounds, such as norfloxacin as an antibacterial agent, quinidine as an antiarrhythmic agent, quinine and chloroquine as antimalaria agents and rebamipide as an anti-ulcer agent. IC50 values (concentration producing 50% inhibition in activity) of norfloxacin, rebamipide and chloroquine at mM concentrations showed them to possess almost no inhibitory activity or influence on drug interaction. Meanwhile, the IC50 value of quinidine was 1.12 mM. The IC50 value of quinine was 160 microM with weak inhibition, suggesting that quinine, at a high dose, influences the metabolism of substrates for CYP2A6 by drug-drug interaction. These results also show that CYP2A6 discriminates the structure difference between the diastereoisomers quinidine and quinine.
12383485	Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identification of metabolites of three phenylcarboxyl derivatives of the 5-HT(1A) antagonist, N-(2-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)ethyl)-N-(2-pyridyl) trans-4-fluorocyclohexanecarboxamide (FCWAY), produced by human and rat hepatocytes. We have previously described fluorine-18 radiolabeled FCWAY [N-(2-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)ethyl)-N-(2-pyridyl) trans-4-fluorocyclohexanecarboxamide] as a high affinity ligand for imaging the 5-HT(1A) receptor in vivo. In a search for radiopharmaceuticals with unique imaging applications using positron emission tomography (PET), we have also developed three new phenylcarboxamide analogues of FCWAY. Two of these analogues were generated by replacing the fluorocyclohexane carboxylic acid with fluorobenzoic acid (FBWAY) or with 3-methyl-4-fluorobenzoic acid (MeFBWAY). The final analogue was generated by replacing the pyridyl group with a pyrimidyl group and the fluorocyclohexane carboxylate with fluorobenzoic acid (FPWAY). We evaluated the metabolic profile of these compounds using either human or rat hepatocytes to produce metabolites and LC-MS/MS to identify these metabolites. We also compared the metabolic rate of these compounds in human or rat hepatocytes. These in vitro metabolism studies indicate that hydrolysis of the amide linkage was the major metabolic pathway for FPWAY and FBWAY in human hepatocytes, whereas aromatic oxidation is the major metabolic pathway for MeFBWAY. The comparative metabolic rate in human hepatocytes was FPWAY>FBWAY>MeFBWAY. In rat hepatocytes, aromatic oxidation was the major metabolic pathway for all three analogs and the rate of this process was similar for all of the analogues. These in vitro metabolic studies demonstrated species differences prior to the acquisition and interpretation of in vivo results.
11765029	Analysis of the lidocaine metabolite 2,6-dimethylaniline in bovine and human milk. 2,6-Dimethylaniline (2,6-xylidine; 2,6-DMA) is a nasal carcinogen in rats. Humans may be exposed to this compound via several routes: 2,6-DMA is found in cigarette smoke; it is a pharmacologically inactive metabolite of some drugs (e.g., the local anesthetic lidocaine) and pesticides (e.g., metalaxyl); and it is an impurity in technical grade metalaxyl. The potential transfer of 2,6-DMA from mother to nursing infant via milk is of toxicological concern. Solid-phase microextraction with separation and detection using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was optimized and used for the analysis of 2,6-DMA in milk. 2,6-DMA-d9 was synthesized and used for quantitation by the isotope ratio method. At a concentration of 5 ppb 2,6-DMA, the method detection limit was 0.20 ppb, and the relative standard deviation was 3.6%. Samples of milk were obtained from bovines administered lidocaine (2.9-3.9 mg/kg) during surgery. A breast milk sample was also obtained from a human donor who received 36 mg lidocaine during dental work. 2,6-DMA was present at levels ranging from 14.5 to 66.0 ppb in bovine milk and was detected at 1.6 ppb in the human milk sample. Our results demonstrate that 2,6-DMA, formed by the metabolism of lidocaine, is transferable to bovine and human milk.
11325575	Metabolism of two new antiepileptic drugs and their principal metabolites S(+)- and R(-)-10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxy carbamazepine. BIA 2-093 and BIA 2-059 are two stereoisomers under development as new antiepileptic drugs. They act as prodrugs for the corresponding hydroxy derivatives (S(+)- or R(-)-10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxy carbamazepine, respectively) which are known to be the active metabolites of the antiepileptic drug oxcarbazepine (OXC). The purpose of this study was to define the metabolic pathway especially in terms of stereoselectivity, and to estimate the possibility of racemization in humans. For in vivo studies, the rat, mouse and rabbit were chosen as models in order to cover a broad spectrum of metabolic activity. In addition, incubations with liver microsomes from these three species plus dog and monkey were compared to results obtained with human liver microsomes. It was found that both drugs were almost instantly hydrolysed to the corresponding 10-hydroxy compounds in mice, rats and rabbits. Mice and rabbits were not able to oxidize the 10-hydroxy compounds to OXC in significant amounts. In the rat, BIA 2-093 also gave origin to OXC, whereas BIA 2-059 resulted in the formation of OXC and the trans-diol metabolite in equal amounts. It could be shown that the rat is able to reduce the formed OXC in liver to S(+)-10-hydroxy metabolite, resulting in a loss of enantiomeric purity after treatment with BIA 2-059 rather than in the case of BIA 2-093. Human liver microsomes hydrolysed BIA 2-093 and BIA 2-059 to their corresponding 10-hydroxy compounds and to OXC in a very small extent with BIA 2-093 only. Therefore, BIA 2-093 and BIA 2-059 seem to be preferable drugs over OXC since they most likely exhibit a 'cleaner' metabolism. From a therapeutic point of view BIA 2-059 would be less appropriate than BIA 2-093 for the purpose of treating epileptic patients due to its propensity to undergo inactivation to the trans-diol.
12606777	Increased antiviral activity of 1-O-hexadecyloxypropyl-[2-(14)C]cidofovir in MRC-5 human lung fibroblasts is explained by unique cellular uptake and metabolism. Recently, there has been renewed interest in finding orally active drugs against smallpox. Cidofovir (CDV) given by parenteral injection has been shown to protect against lethal poxvirus infection. We have been interested in the synthesis and evaluation of orally active derivatives of CDV. Previous studies showed that the CDV and cyclic cidofovir (cCDV) analogs 1-O-hexa-decyloxypropyl-CDV (HDP-CDV) and 1-O-hexadecyloxypropyl-cCDV (HDP-cCDV), show >100-fold increases in antiviral activity versus the unmodified nucleosides against cells infected with orthopoxviruses, cowpox, and vaccinia virus. In contrast to CDV, HDP-CDV is orally bioavailable and has been reported to be orally active in lethal cowpox virus infection in mice. To assess the metabolic basis for the increased antiviral activity of HDP-CDV in vitro, we studied the cellular uptake and anabolic metabolism of (14)C-labeled CDV, cCDV, and their alkoxyalkanol esters HDP-CDV and HDP-cCDV. HDP-CDV and HDP-cCDV were taken up rapidly by MRC-5 human lung fibroblasts in vitro, but uptake of CDV and cCDV was much slower. Analysis of cellular metabolites showed that levels of cidofovir diphosphate (CDV-DP), the active antiviral compound, were >100 times greater with HDP-CDV than levels observed with CDV. When cells were exposed to HDP-CDV, the intracellular half-life of CDV-DP was 10 days versus 2.7 days reported when cells are exposed to CDV. HDP-CDV seems to circumvent poor cellular uptake by rapid association with cellular membrane phospholipids, whereas CDV uptake proceeds via the slow process of fluid endocytosis.
11238192	Metabolism of the beta-oxidized intermediates of N-nitrosodi-n-propylamine: N-nitroso-beta-hydroxypropylpropylamine and N-nitroso-beta-oxopropylpropylamine. The rat liver carcinogen N-nitrosodi-n-propylamine (NDPA) is metabolized to a propylating and methylating species in vivo. Metabolism to a methylating species is believed to require an initial hydroxylation by cytochrome P450s (P450s) to N-nitroso-beta-hydroxypropylpropylamine (NHPPA), which is oxidized to N-nitroso-beta-oxopropylpropylamine (NOPPA), followed by a P450-mediated depropylation to beta-oxopropyldiazotate, which non-enzymatically breaks down to the methylating agent. Purified rat liver P450 2B1 and rabbit liver 2E1 in the reconstituted system and liver microsomes from phenobarbital (PB) and pyridine (Pyr) treated rats readily metabolized NOPPA to a methylating species as determined by the in vitro formation of 7-methylguanine (m7Gua) in DNA. Exposure of cells derived from the human liver epithelium transfected with human 2E1 (T5-2E1) to NOPPA resulted in the formation of m7Gua DNA adducts and a dose dependent toxicity. In vitro incubation of NHPPA with microsomes from PB, Pyr and non-treated (NT) rats and a human microsomal sample also resulted in m7Gua formation. P450s 2B1 and 2E1 oxidized NHPPA to NOPPA, forming 16.5 +/- 3.1 and 20.0 +/- 4.4 pmol NOPPA/pmol P450 in 1 h, respectively. Rat liver cytosol, in the presence of NAD+, oxidized NHPPA to NOPPA at a rate of 13.7 +/- 3.0 pmol/min/mg protein while microsomes from NT rats catalyzed this reaction at 95.6 +/- 16.5 pmol/min/mg protein. Cells derived from hamster lung tissue (V79 control) and T5-neo cells oxidized NHPPA to NOPPA. This oxidation was about 15 fold higher in T5-2E1 or V79 cells transfected with human 2E1 or rat 2B1, respectively. The results are consistent with the putative sequential oxidation pathway and suggest that, at the concentrations tested, oxidation of NHPPA to NOPPA may be predominantly mediated by cytochrome P450s. In addition, it appears that rabbit, rat and human P450 2E1 can catalyze both oxidations.
11765026	Evaluating the impact of hemp food consumption on workplace drug tests. Foods containing seeds or oil of the hemp plant (Cannabis sativa L.) are increasingly found in retail stores in the U.S. The presence of delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in these foods has raised concern over their impact on the results of workplace drug tests for marijuana. Previous studies have shown that eating hemp foods can cause screening and confirmed positive results in urine specimens. This study evaluated the impact of extended daily ingestion of THC via hemp oil on urine levels of its metabolite 11-nor-9-carboxy-delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH) for four distinct daily THC doses. Doses were representative of THC levels now commonly found in hemp seed products and a range of conceivable daily consumption rates. Fifteen THC-naïve adults ingested, over four successive 10-day periods, single daily THC doses ranging from 0.09 to 0.6 mg. Subjects self-administered THC in 15-mL aliquots (20 mL for the 0.6-mg dose) of four different blends of hemp and canola oils. Urine specimens were collected prior to the first ingestion of oil, on days 9 and 10 of each of the four study periods, and 1 and 3 days after the last ingestion. All specimens were screened for cannabinoids by radioimmunoassay (Immunalysis Direct RIA Kit), confirmed for THC-COOH by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and analyzed for creatinine to identify dilute specimens. None of the subjects who ingested daily doses of 0.45 mg of THC screened positive at the 50-ng/mL cutoff. At a daily THC dose of 0.6 mg, one specimen screened positive. The highest THC-COOH level found by GC-MS in any of the specimens was 5.2 ng/mL, well below the 15-ng/mL confirmation cutoff used in federal drug testing programs. A THC intake of 0.6 mg/day is equivalent to the consumption of approximately 125 mL of hemp oil containing 5 microg/g of THC or 300 g of hulled seeds at 2 microg/g. These THC concentrations are now typical in Canadian hemp seed products. Based on our findings, these concentrations appear to be sufficiently low to prevent confirmed positives from the extended and extensive consumption of hemp foods.
12018998	Comparative metabolism of N-tert-butyl-N-[1-(1-oxy-pyridin-4-yl)-ethyl]- and N-tert-butyl-N-(1-phenyl-ethyl)-nitroxide by the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system. The use of spin-trapping agents for a direct ESR detection of *OH in biological systems is limited by the low stability of the hydroxyl radical-derived nitroxides. Among the various probes used for trapping of *OH, DMSO has proven to be highly efficient. The reaction between *OH and DMSO yields methyl radical (CH(3)*), which can react with N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone (PBN) and alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone (POBN) to form stable, ESR-detectable nitroxides. The latter approach has been successfully used in in vivo experiments for analysis of *OH; in these experiments, POBN/*CH(3) and PBN/*CH(3) were detected in the bile duct and the urine of the treated animals. However, the sites of generation of *OH produced in vivo are unknown. Currently, no ESR data is available for the formation of *OH in liver of animals subjected to oxidative stress. Since nitroxides containing aromatic rings are likely to be substrates of cytochrome P450, experiments were carried out for assessing the ability of the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system to metabolize PBN/*CH(3) and POBN/*CH(3), respectively. In the presence of NADPH, rat liver microsomes catalyzed the reduction of POBN/*CH(3) to the corresponding hydroxylamine (POBN/CH(3)), while PBN/*CH(3) was metabolized without accumulation of its hydroxylamine form (PBN/CH(3)). The metabolism of PBN/.CH(3) was inhibited by 4-methylpyrazole and ketoconasole, suggesting that cytochrome P450-catalysis was required for the consumption of this nitroxide. Under anaerobic conditions, both the nitroxide and hydroxylamine forms of PBN/CH(3) were metabolized, implying that these adducts may undergo reductive cytochrome P450-catalyzed biotransformation. On the basis of the susceptibility of PBN/*CH(3) to undergo irreversible metabolic transformation, it is discussed that POBN may prove to be a more efficient spin-trapping agent for the in vivo detection of *OH.
14499337	Metabolite analysis of [11C]Ro15-4513 in mice, rats, monkeys and humans. We performed in vitro and in vivo assays of the metabolism of [(11)C]Ro15-4513 over time in the plasma of mice, rats, monkeys and humans, using a radio-HPLC equipped with a sensitive positron detector, in order to compare the metabolic rates of the radiopharmaceutical agent among the different animal species and to establish a highly sensitive analytical method for the radiotracer agent. We also examined the metabolism of [(11)C]Ro15-4513 in the brain tissue of mice and rats. The analytical method used in this study permitted detection of even extremely low levels of radioactivity (approximately 5,000 dpm). In vitro experiments revealed that [(11)C]Ro15-4513 in the blood was metabolized to hydrolysate [(11)C]A. The species were classified in descending order of the metabolic rate of the radiotracer in vitro as follows; mice, rats, and monkeys/humans. In the in vitro experiment, the percentage of the unchanged drug in the plasma at 60 minutes postdose was 9% in mice, 70% in rats, 97% in monkeys, and 98% in humans. In vivo metabolite analysis in the blood showed the presence of two radioactive metabolites, consisting of one hydrolysate [(11)C]A and another unidentified substance. The species were classified in descending order of the metabolic rate of the radiotracer in vivo as follows; mice, rats/humans, and monkeys. The percentage of the unchanged drug in the plasma was 6% in mice, 21% in rats, 26% in humans, and 40% in monkeys. Furthermore, the in vitro and in vivo experiments conducted to analyze the metabolism of [(11)C]Ro15-4513 in the brain tissue of mice and rats revealed that the radiotracer was metabolized to some extent in the brain tissue of these animals. In the in vivo experiment, the percentage of the unchanged drug at 60 min postdose was 86% in the brain tissue of mice and 88% in the brain tissue of rats, while in the in vitro experiment, the corresponding percentage was 93% in mice, and 91% in rats.
11750100	Anagrelide metabolite induces thrombocytopenia in mice by inhibiting megakaryocyte maturation without inducing platelet aggregation. The mechanism for anagrelide's potent platelet lowering activity in human subjects is not well defined. Studies related to anagrelide function have been hampered by its lack of activity in nonhuman primates and water insolubility. In an effort to define the mechanism whereby anagrelide exerts its therapeutic effect, we identified a water-soluble metabolite (anagrelide.met). The availability of anagrelide.met allowed, for the first time, parallel in vitro and in vivo animal studies centered on the mechanisms by which anagrelide lowers platelet levels. The effects of anagrelide.met on proliferation and maturation of mega-karyocytes (MKs) as well as platelet production were studied both in vitro and in vivo. Anagrelide.met is capable of blocking in vitro MK migration by 20% to 40%. At 100 ng/mL, anagrelide.met selectively blocked in vitro MK maturation, resulting in a 50% decrease in the total number of CD41a(+) MKs, corresponding with a 30% decrease in MK ploidy by day 10 and a 60% decrease by day 20. Daily intraperitoneal injections of anagrelide.met 100 microg into BALB/c mice was sufficient to significantly decrease platelet counts within 24 to 48 hours, stabilizing to 40 to 50% of normal levels by day 5. This was associated with a 45% decrease in the number of developing MKs and an increase in thrombopoietin levels. Anagrelide.met did not alter WBC counts, hematocrit, or bleeding time, or lead to any apparent signs of toxicity. Furthermore, unlike the parent anagrelide compound, anagrelide.met did not inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation even at high concentrations (10 microg/mL). We describe a cross-species reactive anagrelide metabolite that selectively inhibits MK maturation and migration, lowering platelet levels without influencing platelet aggregation.
12054360	An online automatic sample cleanup system for the quantitative detection of the benzene exposure biomarker S-phenylmercapturic acid in human urine by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. An online automatic sample cleanup system was developed for use with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS-MS) for the quantitative detection of the benzene exposure biomarker S-phenylmercapturic acid (S-PMA) in human urine. The sample clean-up system was constructed with an autosampling device, a reversed-phase C18 trap cartridge, a two-position switching valve, and controlling computer software and hardware. The sample cleanup system was interfaced directly with the ESI source of a triple-stage-quadrupole MS using multiple reaction monitoring of negative product ions derived from S-PMA and the internal standard as the detection mode. The calibration curve was linear using human urine spiked at concentrations from 0.23 to 100 mg/L S-PMA (R2 = 0.997). The detection limit of the analytical system for neat S-PMA standard solution was 0.04 microg/L, whereas the detection limit was estimated to be lower than 0.35 microg/L for a urine matrix containing trace amounts of S-PMA. Without tedious manual sample cleanup procedures, the analytical system is fully automatic and therefore useful for high-throughput urinary S-PMA determination. With the selectivity and the sensitivity provided by MS-MS detection, the analytical system can be used for high-throughput and accurate determination of S-PMA levels in human urinary samples as a biomarker for benzene exposure.
14570767	Mechanism-based inhibition of human liver microsomal cytochrome P450 1A2 by zileuton, a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor. Zileuton, a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, was evaluated as an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 activity in human liver microsomes. In the absence of preincubation, the racemate was found to be a weak inhibitor (IC50 > 100 microM) of phenacetin O-deethylation (POD) (CYP1A2), paclitaxel 6alpha-hydroxylation (CYP2C8), diclofenac 4'-hydroxylation (CYP2C9), (S)-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation (CYP2C19), bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation (CYP2D6), testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation (CYP3A4), chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylation (CYP2E1), and bupropion hydroxylation (CYP2B6). When preincubated with NADPH-fortified human liver microsomes in the absence of substrate, zileuton (racemate) was shown to inhibit POD. The effect was NADPH-, time-, and concentration-dependent, and was characterized by a kinact (maximal rate of enzyme inactivation) and apparent KI(inhibitor concentration that supports half the maximal rate of inactivation) of 0.035 min(-1) and 117 microM, respectively (kinact/KIratio of 0.0003 min-1 microM(-1)). Preincubation-dependent inhibition of POD activity was also observed with the individual (S)-(-)- and (R)-(+)-enantiomers of zileuton [(S)-(-)-zileuton; kinact, 0.037 min(-1), KI, 98.2 microM, kinact/KIratio, 0.0004 min(-1) microM(-1); (R)-(+)-zileuton; kinact, 0.012 min(-1), KI, 66.6 microM, kinact/KIratio, 0.0002 min(-1) microM(-1)]. In addition, the inhibition of CYP1A2 was not reversed in the presence of reduced glutathione, catalase, and superoxide dismutase and was refractory to dialysis. Therefore, zileuton was characterized as a mechanism-based inhibitor of human liver microsomal CYP1A2. Mechanism-based inhibition of CYP1A2 may explain why zileuton decreases the oral clearance of antipyrine, propranolol, (R)-warfarin, and theophylline, at doses that have a minimal effect on the pharmacokinetics of (S)-warfarin, phenytoin, and terfenadine.
11802099	Validation of a therapeutic drug monitoring strategy for thiotepa in a high-dose chemotherapy regimen. Thiotepa is an alkylating agent widely used in high-dose chemotherapy. The pharmacokinetics of thiotepa and its main metabolite tepa show a wide interpatient variability, which may be responsible for the interpatient variability in toxicity. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a pharmacokinetically guided dosing strategy with the sum of the thiotepa and tepa area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) as the target parameter. A total of 46 patients received 77 courses of chemotherapy with thiotepa (80-120 mg/m(2) per day) divided into two daily 30-minute infusions in combination with cyclophosphamide and carboplatin. Patients received up to three courses of chemotherapy. The interpatient, course-to-course, day-to-day, and residual variability in the pharmacokinetics of thiotepa and tepa were estimated with a population analysis with the software program NONMEM. The planned strategy consisted of the collection of blood samples on day 1 and either day 3 or day 4 of each 4-day course. The thiotepa dose was planned to be adjusted on day 3 of each course and before the start of a new course on the basis of Bayesian predictions of the pharmacokinetics with data of day 1 and/or the possible previous course. The prediction procedure was validated by dividing the dataset into an index and validation set. The Bayesian predictions of the validation set were compared with true AUC values generated with individual fits of each course. The performance of the complete strategy was tested with a simulation procedure in 1,000 patients. Interpatient variability and course-to-course variability were in the same order (+/-20%); day-to-day variability was less (+/-15%). The sampling strategy resulted in predictions of the AUC without bias with acceptable precision (+/-20%). The simulation showed that variability in exposure was effectively decreased by the dosing strategy. This strategy resulted in a reduction in the variability of the exposure to thiotepa and tepa and can be implemented in a clinical study.
12493578	A new series of 13 buprenorphine-related deaths. Buprenorphine at high dosage became available in France in 1996, as a substitution treatment for heroin addicts. Since this date, numerous deaths were attributed to this drug. This paper reports a new series of 13 fatalities involving buprenorphine observed at the Institute of Legal Medicine of Strasbourg, between August 2000 to October 2001. During the mentioned period, about 800 forensic cases were screened at the laboratory. Buprenorphine and its primary metabolite norbuprenophine were assayed in postmortem specimens by HPLC/MS. From these 13 subjects, 11 were male. Blood levels ranged from 0.3 to 7.7 ng/mL (mean 3.5 ng/mL) and 0.3 to 16.2 ng/mL (mean 2.9 ng/mL) for buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine, respectively. The mean values appear to be within the therapeutic range. IV injection of crushed tablets, a concomitant intake of psychotropics (especially benzodiazepines and neuroleptics) and the high dosage of the buprenorphine formulation available in France appear as the major risk factors for such fatalities.
12765874	Biological monitoring of low level occupational xylene exposure and the role of recent exposure. The correlation between low level time-weighted average (TWA) atmospheric xylene exposure (p.p.m.) and urinary methylhippuric acid (MHA) expressed per gram of creatinine was examined. Subjects were recruited from workplaces that utilized xylene. Ambient monitoring of o-, m- and p-xylene isomers was carried out using passive diffusion vapour monitors. Adjusted (post-shift minus pre-shift) and post-shift urinary levels of xylene metabolites (2-, 3- and 4-MHA) were determined by GC-MS. Twenty subjects were recruited into the study. Total xylene TWA exposures were 3.36 +/- 3.63 p.p.m. (mean +/- SD) with a range of 0.03-14.44 p.p.m. The r(2) values for the regression equations between xylene exposure and individual and total adjusted MHA isomers were 0.390, 0.709, 0.677 and 0.631 for o-, m-, p- and total xylenes, respectively, which was greater than the respective correlations between non-adjusted samples. In conclusion, biological monitoring of occupational xylene exposure at levels <15 p.p.m. using urinary MHA showed a good correlation with atmospheric levels and is a valid complement to ambient monitoring. Even though occupational xylene exposure in the workplaces studied was generally low, MHA was found in the pre-shift urine of all workers and the use of adjusted values showed modest improvements in correlations. Recent exposure prior to sampling, either from occupational or non-occupational sources, should be considered when biological monitoring of xylene is undertaken. Extrapolation of data from this study predicted a MHA concentration in post-shift urine of 1.3 g/g creatinine after exposure to a TWA of 100 p.p.m. xylene.
12185557	Phenotypic polymorphism of CYP2A6 activity in a Chinese population. To investigate the distribution characteristics of CYP2A6 activity in a Chinese population and to examine the sex-related differences in CYP2A6 activities. One hundred and twenty healthy volunteers, 63 men and 57 women, were included in the study. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2A6 activity was measured using the ratio of urinary 7-hydroxycoumarin (7-OHC) excreted in 8 h after a coumarin dose. The concentrations of 7-OHC in urine were determined using high performance liquid chromatography. A 300-fold interindividual variation of CYP2A6 activity was shown in the studied Chinese population. The coefficient of variation of CYP2A6 activity was 27.2%. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test indicated a non-normal distribution of CYP2A6 activity ( P<0.001). Probit plots of CYP2A6 activity revealed a bimodal distribution with breakpoint of activity index near 0.47. The percentage of poor metabolizers (PMs) was 13.3% (95% confidence interval 7.3%-19.4%) in this population. Residual analysis also supported bimodality ( P<0.01). The CYP2A6 activities of females were obviously higher than those of males when the activity index was less than 0.74, although no statistically significant difference in the activity index of CYP2A6 between males and females was found. However, there was no sex-related difference in the incidence of PMs ( P>0.5). There are pronounced interindividual variations and phenotypic polymorphism of CYP2A6 activities in the Chinese population.
14667942	Evidence that unsaturated fatty acids are potent inhibitors of renal UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT): kinetic studies using human kidney cortical microsomes and recombinant UGT1A9 and UGT2B7. Renal ischaemia is associated with accumulation of fatty acids (FA) and mobilisation of arachidonic acid (AA). Given the capacity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isoforms to metabolise both drugs and FA, we hypothesised that FA would inhibit renal drug glucuronidation. The effect of FA (C2:0-C20:5) on 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) glucuronidation was investigated using human kidney cortical microsomes (HKCM) and recombinant UGT1A9 and UGT2B7 as the enzyme sources. 4-MU glucuronidation exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics with HKCM (apparent K(m) (K(m)(app)) 20.3 microM), weak substrate inhibition with UGT1A9 (K(m)(app) 10.2 microM, K(si) 289.6 microM), and sigmoid kinetics with UGT2B7 (S(50)(app)440.6 microM) Similarly, biphasic UDP-glucuronic acid (UDPGA) kinetics were observed with HKCM (S(50) 354.3 microM) and UGT1A9 (S(50) 88.2 microM). In contrast, the Michaelis-Menten kinetics for UDPGA observed with UGT2B7 (K(m)(app) 493.2 microM) suggested that kinetic interactions with UGTs were specific to the xenobiotic substrate and the co-substrate (UDPGA). FA (C16:1-C20:5) significantly inhibited (25-93%) HKCM, UGT1A9 or UGT2B7 catalysed 4-MU glucuronidation. Although linoleic acid (LA) and AA were both competitive inhibitors of 4-MU glucuronidation by HKCM (K(i)(app) 6.34 and 0.15 microM, respectively), only LA was a competitive inhibitor of UGT1A9 (K(i)(app) 4.06 microM). In contrast, inhibition of UGT1A9 by AA exhibited atypical kinetics. These data indicate that LA and AA are potent inhibitors of 4-MU glucuronidation catalysed by human kidney UGTs and recombinant UGT1A9 and UGT2B7. It is conceivable therefore that during periods of renal ischaemia FA may impair renal drug glucuronidation thus compromising the protective capacity of the kidney against drug-induced nephrotoxicity.
14608613	Determination of ketotifen and its conjugated metabolite in human plasma by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry: application to a pharmacokinetic study. A sensitive and specific liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method was developed for the investigation of the pharmacokinetics of ketotifen and its major metabolite, ketotifen N-glucuronide, in human plasma. The plasma samples were treated by liquid-liquid extraction and analyzed using LC/MS/MS with an electrospray ionization interface. Diphenhydramine was used as the internal standard. The method had a lower limit of quantitation of 10 pg/mL for ketotifen, which offered increased sensitivity, selectivity and speed of analysis, compared with existing methods. The intra- and inter-day precision were measured to be below 8.2% and accuracy between -2.4% and 3.4% for all QC samples. Incubation of the plasma samples with beta-glucuronidase allowed the quantitation of ketotifen N-glucuronide. This quantitation method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study of ketotifen and its major metabolite after oral administration of 2 mg ketotifen fumarate to 16 healthy volunteers.
14681342	Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the ETA-selective endothelin receptor antagonist SPP301 in healthy human subjects. SPP301 is a competitive antagonist of ET-1 with a high selectivity for the ETA receptor. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed to investigate the tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of SPP301 after single oral doses in male healthy subjects; doses of 5, 20, 50, 100, and 200 mg were given to different groups of 4 or 8 subjects each. The effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of SPP301 was assessed for the 50-mg dose according to a sequential design in the same subjects. At regular intervals, blood pressure and pulse rate, plasma levels of ET-1 and of SPP301 and its hydroxymethyl metabolite, and urinary excretion of the parent drug and its metabolite were determined. SPP301 was generally well tolerated. At doses >20 mg, adverse events that are typical for vasodilating agents-namely, headache, nausea and vomiting, dizziness, and postural hypotension-were observed. Maximum plasma levels of SPP301 were reached within 4.5 hours. Cmax and AUC values increased linearly with doses up to 100 mg. The apparent terminal half-life was quite constant over the whole dose range and ranged from 7.5 to 15.2 hours. Urinary excretion of SPP301 was below 0.1% of any dose. Cmax and AUC of the metabolite amounted only to about 5% of the values for SPP301. Concomitant food intake had no effect on the overall exposure but increased average peak plasma concentrations of SPP301 by around 50%. Plasma ET-1 increased nearly twofold at the 5-mg SPP301 dose, with no further relevant increase at higher doses. In conclusion, SPP301 is an active ET-1 antagonist and is well tolerated. The pharmacokinetics of the drug and its metabolite are linear up to 100 mg. Food does not affect overall exposure of SPP301 but increases Cmax. Urinary excretion of SPP301 is below 0.1% of the dose administered.
12920163	Inhibitory effect of glyburide on human cytochrome p450 isoforms in human liver microsomes. The inhibitory effect of glyburide [International Nonproprietary Name (INN), glibenclamide] on CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 activities was evaluated using pooled human liver microsomes. Glyburide strongly inhibited CYP2C9-catalyzed S-warfarin and phenytoin metabolism in a competitive manner, with Ki (IC50) values of 2.4 (11.3) microM and 3.1 (9.4) microM, respectively. CYP3A4-catalyzed midazolam 1-hydroxylation was inhibited by glyburide with a Ki (IC50) value of 42.5 (90.0) microM. However, glyburide showed no appreciable inhibitory effect on CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, or CYP2D6. In summary, glyburide showed potent inhibition on CYP2C9 and weak inhibition on CYP3A4, whereas it had minimal or no inhibitory effect on the other cytochromes p450 examined. It is anticipated that clinically significant drug-drug interactions will ensue when glyburide is coadministered with agents that are cleared primarily by the CYP2C9-mediated pathway and those with narrow therapeutic ranges.
11835190	Stereoselective disposition of talinolol in man. The disposition of the beta-blocking drug talinolol is controlled by P-glycoprotein in man. Because talinolol is marketed as a racemate, we reevaluated the serum-concentration time profiles of talinolol of a previously published study with single intravenous (30 mg) and repeated oral talinolol (100 mg for 14 days) before and after comedication of rifampicin (600 mg per day for 9 days) in eight male healthy volunteers (age 22-26 years, body weight 67-84 kg) with respect to differences in the kinetic profiles of the two enantiomers S(-) talinolol and R(+) talinolol. Additionally, the metabolism of talinolol in human liver microsomes was examined. After oral administration, S(-) talinolol was slightly less absorbed and faster eliminated than R(+) talinolol. The absolute bioavailabilty of the R(+) enantiomer of talinolol was slightly but significantly higher than of its S(-) enantiomer. Coadministration of rifampicin further intensified this difference in the disposition of R(+) and S(-) talinolol (p < 0.05). Formation of 4-trans hydroxytalinolol was the major metabolic pathway in human liver microsomes. All Cl(int) values of S(-) were higher than of R(+) talinolol; 0.1 microM ketoconazole inhibited the formation of all metabolites. In conclusion, the stereoselectivity of talinolol disposition is of minor importance, and most likely caused by presystemic biotransformation via CYP3A4. The less active R(+) talinolol might be suitable for phenotyping P-glycoprotein expression in man.
11167666	Population pharmacokinetics of thioTEPA and its active metabolite TEPA in patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy. To study the population pharmacokinetics of thioTEPA and its main metabolite TEPA in patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy consisting of thioTEPA (80-120 mg x m(-2) x day(-1)), cyclophosphamide (1000-1500 mg x m(-2) x day(-1)) and carboplatin (265-400 mg x m(-2) x day(-1)) for 4 days. ThioTEPA and TEPA kinetic data were processed with a two-compartment model using the nonlinear mixed effect modelling program NONMEM. Interindividual variability (IIV), interoccasion variability (IOV) and residual variability in the pharmacokinetics were estimated. The influence of patient characteristics on the pharmacokinetics was also determined. A total number of 40 patients receiving 65 courses of chemotherapy was included. Clearance of thioTEPA (CL) was 34 l x h(-1) with an IIV and IOV of 18 and 11%, respectively. The volume of distribution of thioTEPA was 47 l (IIV = 7.5%; IOV = 19%). The fraction of thioTEPA converted to TEPA divided by the volume of distribution of TEPA was 0.030 l-1 (IIV = 39%; IOV = 32%) and the elimination rate constant of TEPA was 0.64 h(-1) (IIV = 27%; IOV = 32%). CL of thioTEPA was correlated with alkaline phosphatase and serum albumin. The volume of distribution of thioTEPA and the elimination rate constant of TEPA were correlated with total protein levels and body weight, respectively. A model for the description of the pharmacokinetics of thioTEPA and TEPA was developed. Factors involved in the interpatient variability of thioTEPA and TEPA pharmacokinetics were identified. Since, IOV of both thioTEPA and TEPA was equal to or smaller than IIV, therapeutic drug monitoring based on data of previous courses may be meaningful using this population model.
12111109	Leucocyte versus erythrocyte thioguanine nucleotide concentrations in children taking thiopurines for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The aim of this study was to compare leucocyte and erythrocyte thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) cytotoxic metabolite concentrations in children with lymphoblastic leukaemia taking mercaptopurine (MP) or thioguanine (TG) as part of their long-term remission maintenance chemotherapy. Ten consecutive children treated on the MRC ALL97 protocol were studied. Six were randomized to TG and four to MP. Leucocyte and erythrocyte thiopurine nucleotide metabolites were measured after the children had been titrated to the standard thiopurine protocol dose, or higher. Children taking TG accumulated significantly higher erythrocyte TGN concentrations than those taking MP (median difference 1171 pmol/8 x 10(8) erythrocytes, 95% CI 766 to 2169, P<0.02), but there was no significant difference in the concentration range of leucocyte TGNs generated from TG or MP. In those children taking TG, median TGN concentrations were 5142 pmol/8 x 10(8) leucocytes and 1472 pmol/8 x 10(8) erythrocytes (3.5-fold difference, median difference 3390 pmol/8 x 10(8) cells, 95% CI 1559 to 7695, P=0.005), compared to 5422 pmol/8 x 10(8) leucocytes and 261 pmol/8 x 10(8) erythrocytes (20-fold difference, median difference 5054 pmol/8 x 10(8) cells, 95% CI 2281 to 6328, P=0.03) in those taking MP. Despite the accumulation of significantly higher erythrocyte TGN concentrations for TG compared with MP, the accumulation of leucocyte TGNs in children taking TG was similar to the range of leucocyte TGNs in children taking MP. Therefore, when correlating intracellular TGNs to clinical effect, the range of erythrocyte TGN metabolites will be higher for those children taking TG than in those taking MP.
11129502	Pharmacokinetics of chlorambucil in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia: comparison of different days, cycles and doses. The effects of repeated treatment cycles and different doses on intraindividual variation in oral bioavailability of chlorambucil and its first, active, and more toxic metabolite, phenylacetic acid mustard, were studied. Chlorambucil and phenylacetic acid mustard concentrations were measured with HPLC on Day 1 and on Day 4 in 15 timed blood samples from 11 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients receiving chlorambucil therapy cycles. Bioavailability was evaluated also after the first chlorambucil doses of six consecutive treatment cycles repeated every 4 weeks with increasing chlorambucil doses starting with 0.8 mg/kg/4 days, and increased by 0.1 mg/kg/4 days cycle. Area under the concentration-time-curve (AUC) from t=0 to infinite was in average 3.2 hr* microg/ml for the first cycle, and decreased by 17% in four days (P<0.05). The mean distribution half-life of chlorambucil was 0.49 hr and the terminal elimination half-life 2.45 hr. The bioavailability of chlorambucil decreased further when 4-day treatment cycles were repeated. For the fifth cycle, dose-corrected AUC for the first 2 hr was 33% smaller than that for the first cycle (P for trend <0.01). Data suggest accelerated metabolism and elimination of chlorambucil and phenylacetic acid mustard, but reduced oral bioavailability of chlorambucil cannot be excluded. However, except for AUC, none of the pharmacokinetic parameters of chlorambucil changed significantly during the first 4-day treatment period. The maximal plasma concentration and AUC of phenylacetic acid mustard did not change significantly during repeated treatment cycles. According to this trial a dose adjustment of chlorambucil is not necessary during a short-term course, but may be necessary when treatment cycles are repeated. An average increase in the chlorambucil dose of 10% per cycle maintains similar plasma concentration of chlorambucil.
12913238	Synthesis and preliminary biological evaluation of a new pyridocarbazole derivative covalently linked to a thymidine nucleoside as a potential targeted antitumoral agent. I. The therapy of human cancer is one of the more pursued goals by medicinal chemistry research. Most of the compounds clinically used as a treatment owe their efficacy to their cytotoxic interaction (direct or indirect) with nuclear DNA. This interaction results in the inhibition of DNA synthesis and the degradation of nucleic strands. Ellipticine is a naturally occurring 6H-pyrido[4,3-b]carbazole alkaloid endowed with antitumor activity, and several ellipticine derivatives have been used in clinical trials. We previously reported some 1,4-dimethyl-9H-carbazole derivatives structurally related to ellipticine. The purpose of our research was to transform the pyridocarbazole in a prodrug so that it would have more penetration in the tumor cells and block their replication. Our prodrug is slowly hydrolyzed in human plasma in the corresponding acid. From these preliminary results, we deduce that our compound can block cellular replication. Our hypothesis is that the antitumoral activity is probably related to the induction of damage to DNA, without cellular lysis in the short term.
11854151	Inhibition of cytochromes P450 by antifungal imidazole derivatives. The interactions of a panel of antifungal agents with cytochromes P450 (P450s), as a means of predicting potential drug-drug interactions, have not yet been investigated. The objective of this study was to evaluate the specificity and selectivity of five antifungal agents using selective probe reactions for each of the eight major P450s. The index reactions used were phenacetin O-deethylation (for CYP1A2), coumarin 7-hydroxylation (CYP2A6), diclofenac 4'-hydroxylation (CYP2C9), omeprazole 5-hydroxylation (CYP2C19), dextromethorphan O-demethylation (CYP2D6), 7-ethoxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin deethylation (CYP2B6), chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylation (CYP2E1), and omeprazole sulfonation (CYP3A4). Five antifungal agents that include an imidazole moiety (clotrimazole, miconazole, sulconazole, tioconazole, and ketoconazole) were examined in cDNA-expressing microsomes from human lymphoblast cells or human liver microsomes. All inhibitors studied demonstrated nonselective inhibition of P450s. Ketoconazole seemed to be the most selective for CYP3A4, although it also inhibited CYP2C9. High-affinity inhibition was seen for CYP1A2 (sulconazole and tioconazole K(i), 0.4 microM), CYP2B6 (miconazole K(i), 0.05 microM; sulconazole K(i), 0.04 microM), CYP2C19 (miconazole K(i), 0.05 microM; sulconazole K(i), 0.008 microM; tioconazole K(i), 0.04 microM), CYP2C9 (sulconazole K(i), 0.01 microM), CYP2D6 (miconazole K(i), 0.70 microM; sulconazole K(i), 0.40 microM), CYP2E1 (tioconazole K(i), 0.4 microM), and CYP3A4 (clotrimazole K(i), 0.02 microM; miconazole K(i), 0.03 microM; tioconazole K(i), 0.02 microM). Therefore, this class of compounds is likely to result in significant drug-drug interactions in vivo.
11854155	The gastroprokinetic and antiemetic drug metoclopramide is a substrate and inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2D6. Metoclopramide is increasingly prescribed for conditions previously treated with cisapride, but its metabolic enzymology and drug interactions are poorly understood. Using human liver microsomes (HLMs) and recombinant human cytochromes P450 (P450), we identified the major route of metoclopramide oxidation and the P450 isoforms involved. We also documented the ability of metoclopramide to inhibit the P450 system, using isoform-specific substrate reaction probes of CYP1A2, 2C19, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4. Metoclopramide was predominantly N-dealkylated to monodeethylmetoclopramide, a metabolite that has not so far been described in humans. Formation rate of this metabolite followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics (K(m), 68 +/- 16 microM; V(max), 183 +/- 57 pmol/min/mg of protein; n = 3 HLMs). Of the isoform-specific inhibitors tested, 1 microM quinidine was a potent inhibitor of metoclopramide (25 microM) monodeethylation [by an average of 58.2%; range, approximately 38% (HL09-14-99) to 78.7% (HL161)] with K(i) values highly variable among the HLMs tested (K(i), mean +/- S.D., 2.7 +/- 2.8 microM; range, 0.15 microM in HL66, 2.4 microM in HL09-14-99, and 5.7 microM in HLD). Except troleandomycin, which inhibited metoclopramide metabolism in only one HLM (by approximately 23% in HL09-14-99), the effect of other inhibitors was minimal. Among the recombinant human P450 isoforms examined, monodeethylmetoclopramide was formed at the highest rate by CYP2D6 (V = 4.5 +/- 0.3 pmol/min/pmol of P450) and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2 (0.97 +/- 0.15 pmol/min/pmol of P450). The K(m) value derived (approximately 53 microM) was close to that from HLMs (68 microM). Metoclopramide is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 at therapeutically relevant concentrations (K(i) = 4.7 +/- 1.3 microM), with negligible effect on other isoforms tested. Further inhibition of CYP2D6 was observed when metoclopramide was preincubated with HLMs and NADPH-generating system before the substrate probe was added (maximum rate of inactivation, K(inact) = 0.02 min(-1), and the concentration required to achieve the half-maximal rate of inactivation, K'(i) = 0.96 microM), suggesting mechanism-based inhibition. Metoclopramide elimination is likely to be slowed in poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 or in patients taking inhibitors of this isoform, whereas metoclopramide itself could reduce the clearance of CYP2D6 substrate drugs.
12149304	Clinical pharmacokinetics of irinotecan and its metabolites: a population analysis. To build population pharmacokinetic (PK) models for irinotecan (CPT-11) and its currently identified metabolites. Seventy cancer patients (24 women and 46 men) received 90-minute intravenous infusions of CPT-11 in the dose range of 175 to 300 mg/m(2). The PK models were developed to describe plasma concentration profiles of the lactone and carboxylate forms of CPT-11 and 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38) and the total forms of SN-38 glucuronide (SN-38G), 7-ethyl-10-[4-N-(5-aminopentanoic acid)-1-piperidino]-carbonyloxycamptothecin (APC), and 7-ethyl-10-[4-amino-1-piperidino]-carbonyloxycamptothecin (NPC) by using NONMEM. The interconversion between the lactone and carboxylate forms of CPT-11 was relatively rapid, with an equilibration half-life of 14 minutes in the central compartment and hydrolysis occurring at a rate five times faster than lactonization. The same interconversion also occurred in peripheral compartments. CPT-11 lactone had extensive tissue distribution (steady-state volume of distribution [Vss], 445 L) compared with the carboxylate form (Vss, 78 L, excluding peripherally formed CPT-11 carboxylate). Clearance (CL) was higher for the lactone form (74.3 L/h) compared with the carboxylate form (12.3 L/h). During metabolite data modeling, goodness of fit indicated a preference of SN-38 and NPC to be formed out of the lactone form of CPT-11, whereas APC could be modeled best by presuming formation from CPT-11 carboxylate. The interconversion between SN-38 lactone and carboxylate was slower than that of CPT-11, with the lactone form dominating at equilibrium. The CLs for SN-38 lactone and carboxylate were similar, but the lactone form had more extensive tissue distribution. Plasma data of CPT-11 and metabolites could be adequately described by this compartmental model, which may be useful in predicting the time courses, including interindividual variability, of all characterized substances after intravenous administrations of CPT-11.
12698986	Chromatographic determination of free lidocaine and its active metabolites in plasma from patients under epidural anesthesia. We developed a simple and selective assay method for simultaneous determination of free lidocaine (LDC) and its active metabolites, monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX) in plasma, by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The method was applied to the plasma concentration monitoring in continuous epidural anesthesia with LDC. Free fraction was separated from plasma by using an ultrafiltration technique. Free and total LDC, MEGX and GX in plasma were analyzed by HPLC equipped with ordinary octadecylsilyl silica (ODS) column and ultraviolet (UV) detector. Five male patients with cancer who received epidural injection of 1.5% LDC for 5 hours in elective thoracic surgery, were enrolled to determine the plasma levels of total and free LDC, MEGX and GX. The calibration curve for free LDC, MEGX and GX were linear at the concentration of 25 to 1,000 ng ml(-1) (r = 0.9998 - 0.9999). The recoveries for LDC, MEGX and GX from plasma water were ranged 73.2-89.1%. The coefficient variations for intra- and inter-day assay for LDC, MEGX and GX were less than 4.1%. The detection limit ofeach drug was 20 ng ml(-1). Plasma-free MEGX after 180 min epidural injection was higher than free LDC, even though the total concentration of MEGX was 4 times lower than that of LDC. The percentages of free fraction for LDC, MEGX and GX were 11.7, 48.5 and 78.3% after 5-hour epidural administration of LDC. Since the free fraction of MEGX and GX increases and exceeds the concentration of free LDC during continuous epidural anesthesia, accumulation of these toxic metabolites should be carefully monitored as well as LDC. The present method is a reliable technique and can be applied to monitoring free LDC, MEGX and GX, which provide us beneficial information as to the LDC metabolism and toxicity.
12699742	Synthesis, in vitro, and in vivo evaluation of phosphate ester derivatives of combretastatin A-4. Combretastatin A-4 disodiumphosphate (CA4P), a prodrug formulation of the natural product combretastatin A-4 (CA4), is currently in clinical investigation for the treatment of cancer. In vivo, CA4P is rapidly enzymatically converted to CA4, a potent inhibitor of tubulin polymerization (IC(50)=1-2 microM), and rapidly causes bloodflow shutdown in tumor tissues. A variety of alkyl and aryl di- and triesters of CA4P have been synthesized and evaluated as potential CA4 prodrugs and/or stable CA4P analogues.
12112383	Identification of N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-4-azobiphenyl by (32)P-postlabeling analyses of DNA in human uroepithelial cells exposed to proximate metabolites of the environmental carcinogen 4-aminobiphenyl. DNA adducts formed in human uroepithelial cells (HUC) following exposure to N-hydroxy-4-aminobiphenyl (N-OH-ABP), the proximate metabolite of the human bladder carcinogen 4-aminobiphenyl (ABP), were analyzed by the (32)P-postlabeling method. Two adducts detected by (32)P-postlabeling were previously identified as the 3',5'-bisphospho derivatives of N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-4-aminobiphenyl (dG-C8-ABP) and N-(deoxyadenosin-8-yl)-4-aminobiphenyl (dA-C8-ABP) (Frederickson S et al. [1992] Carcinogenesis 13: 955-961; Hatcher and Swaminathan [1995b] Carcinogenesis 16: 295-301). In contrast to the dG-C8-ABP adduct, which was 3'-dephosphorylated by nuclease P1, dA-C8-ABP was resistant to nuclease P1, thus providing an enrichment step before postlabeling. Autoradiography of the two-dimensional thin-layer chromatogram of the postlabeled products obtained following nuclease P1 digestion revealed several minor adducts, one of which has been identified in the present study. Postlabeling analyses following nuclease P1 digestion of the products obtained from the reaction of N-acetoxy-4-aminobiphenyl with deoxyguanosine-3'-monophosphate (dGp) demonstrated the presence of this minor adduct. The 3'-monophosphate derivative of the adduct was subsequently chromatographically purified and subjected to spectroscopic analyses. Based on proton NMR and mass spectroscopic analyses of the synthetic product, the chemical structure of the adduct has been identified as N-(deoxyguanosin-N(2)-yl)-4-azobiphenyl (dG-N==N-ABP). (32)P-Postlabeling analysis of the nuclease P1-enriched DNA hydrolysate of HUCs treated with N-OH-ABP or N-hydroxy-4-acetylaminobiphenyl (N-OH-AABP) showed the presence of the dG-N==N-ABP adduct. It was also detected in calf thymus DNA incubated with HUC cytosol and N-OH-ABP in the presence of acetyl-CoA, or incubated with HUC microsomes and N-OH-AABP. These results demonstrate that in the target cells for ABP carcinogenesis in vivo, N-OH-ABP and N-OH-AABP are bioactivated by acyltransferases to reactive arylnitrenium ions that covalently interact at the N2 position of deoxyguanosine in DNA.
12051572	Methylation of quercetin and fisetin, flavonoids widely distributed in edible vegetables, fruits and wine, by human liver. The aim of this investigation was to study the methylation of quercetin and fisetin, 2 chemically related flavonoids, in human liver and to this purpose, an assay was set-up to measure the rates of quercetin and fisetin methylation in human liver. The methylation rates (pmol/min/mg) of quercetin and fisetin were measured in 10 liver samples and the mean +/- SD and the median were 170+/-30 and 177 (quercetin) and 183+/-15 and 178 (fisetin). The rates of quercetin and fisetin methylation were not different (p = 0.283). The fold of variation among samples was 2 (quercetin) and 1.3 (fisetin). Methyltransferase towards quercetin and fisetin followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and the Km values were 2.6+/-0.3 (quercetin) and 8.6+/-0.7 microM (fisetin, p = 0.009) and the Vmax values were 187+/-20 (quercetin) and 276+/-33 pmol/min/mg (fisetin, p = 0.009). Two, 4 and 8 microl of red Chianti wine added to the incubation mixture reduced the rate of quercetin methylation to 75+/-4%, 65+/-9% and 59+/-9%, respectively, and that of fisetin methylation to 62+/-3%, 51+/-3% and 44+/-4%, respectively. In conclusion, quercetin and fisetin are methylated in human liver and their rates of methylation have a limited variation among subjects.
12659714	Lipid peroxidation and cell death mechanisms in rats and human cells induced by chloral hydrate. Chloral hydrate (CH) is widely used as a sedative and hypnotic in pediatric medicine. It is also a by-product of water chlorination and a metabolite of trichloroethylene. We examined the toxicological effects and cell death mechanisms of CH in rats and human Chang liver cells and lymphocytes. Monitoring of urinary 8-epi-PGF2alpha and serum levels of TNF-alpha served as index of lipid peroxidation and cytokine stimulation. The results indicated that a single intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg CH in rats led to a nearly five-fold increase in urinary 8-epi-PGF2alpha on day 1, and a mild decrease on day 2 and day 3. The same treatment also induced significantly higher amounts of serum TNF-alpha on day 2 (about seven-fold). When the rats were treated with CH and vitamin E simultaneously, the amount of urinary 8-epi-PGF2alpha and serum TNF- were significantly lower than that in the rats treated with CH alone. CH caused a greater cytotoxic effect in human Chang liver cells than in comparison with lymphocytes. After treatment with CH, apoptosis features were observed in human lymphocytes, but not Chang liver cells. CH-induced cell damage in lymphocytes may offer signals for the induction of caspases activation. Further studies are needed to evaluate the relationship between caspases activation and the cleavage of other death substrates during postmitotic apoptosis in human lymphocytes.
12401345	Monolithic silica rod liquid chromatography with ultraviolet or fluorescence detection for metabolite analysis of cytochrome P450 marker reactions. In vitro cytochrome P450 assays are used in metabolism studies in support of early phases of drug discovery to investigate, e.g., metabolic stability, enzyme inhibition and induction by new chemical entities. LC-UV and LC-fluorescence are traditional analytical tools in support of such studies. However, these tools typically comprise different methods of relatively low throughput for the various metabolites of probe reactions. In recent years, LC-MS methods have been developed to increase throughput. Increased throughput can also be achieved by means of modern chromatographic tools in combination with UV and fluorescence detection. This approach is especially suitable when cytochrome P450 isoforms are investigated by means of single probe incubations. Here, an LC-UV/fluorescence system based on a monolithic porous silica column is described for the analysis of metabolites of nine cytochrome P450 marker reactions [phenacetin to paracetamol (CYP1A2), coumarin to 7-hydroxycoumarin (CYP2A6), paclitaxel to 6alpha-hydroxypaclitaxel (CYP2C8), diclofenac to 4-hydroxydiclofenac (CYP2C9), mephenytoin to 4-hydroxymephenytoin (CYP2C19), bufuralol to 1-hydroxybufuralol (CYP2D6), chlorzoxazone to 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone (CYP2E1), midazolam to 1-hydroxymidazolam (CYP3A4), and testosteron to 6beta-hydroxytestosteron (CYP3A4)]. While offering sensitivities and linear ranges comparable to previously reported methods, the set-up described here provides ease of use and increased throughput with maximum cycle times of 4.5 min.
12906896	Enantioselective quantitation of the ecstasy compound (R)- and (S)-N-ethyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine and its major metabolites in human plasma and urine. An enantioselective HPLC method has been developed and validated for the stereospecific analysis of N-ethyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDE) and its major metabolites N-ethyl-4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (HME) and 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA). These compounds have been analyzed both from human plasma and urine after administration of 70 mg pure MDE-hydrochloride enantiomers to four subjects. The samples were prepared by hydrolysis of the o-glucuronate and sulfate conjugates using beta-glucuronidase/arylsulfatase and solid-phase extraction with a cation-exchange phase. A chiral stationary protein phase (chiral-CBH) was used for the stereoselective determination of MDE, HME and MDA in a single HPLC run using sodium dihydrogenphosphate, ethylendiaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt and isopropanol as the mobile phase (pH 6.44) and fluorimetric detection (lambda(ex) 286 nm, lambda(em) 322 nm). Moreover, a suitable internal standard (N-ethyl-3,4-methylenedioxybenzylamine) was synthesized and qualified for quantitation purposes. The method showed high recovery rates (>95%) and limits of quantitation for MDE and MDA of 5 ng/ml and for HME of 10 ng/ml. The RSDs for all working ranges of MDE, MDA and HME in plasma and urine, respectively, were less than 1.5%. After validation of the analytical methods in plasma and urine samples pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. The plasma concentrations of (R)-MDE exceeded those of the S-enantiomer (ratio R:S of the area under the curve, 3.1) and the plasma half time of (R)-MDE was longer than that of (S)-MDE (7.9 vs. 4.0 h). In contrast, the stereochemical disposition of the MDE metabolites HME and MDA was reversed. Concentrations of the (S)-metabolites in plasma of volunteers were much higher than those of the (R)-enantiomers.
14522044	Determination of irinotecan (CPT-11) and SN-38 in human whole blood and red blood cells by liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. An analytical method was developed for the anticancer agent irinotecan (CPT-11) and its main metabolite SN-38 in human whole blood and in red blood cells (RBCs). Sample pretreatment involved deproteinization of whole blood or plasma-diluted RBCs isolated by MESED instruments, with a mixture of aqueous perchloric acid and methanol (1:1, v/v). Separation was carried out using isocratic elution on a Hypersil ODS stationary phase, with detection at excitation and emission wavelengths of 355 and 515 nm, respectively. The lower limit of quantitation (LLQ) in blood was established at 5.00 ng/ml for both compounds, with values for within-run precision (WRP) and between-run precision (BRP) of less than 10%. The method is currently being applied to investigate the blood distribution of CPT-11 and SN-38 in cancer patients.
14622957	Determination of phenethyl isothiocyanate in human plasma and urine by ammonia derivatization and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) is a dietary compound present in cruciferous vegetables that has cancer-preventive properties. Our objective was to develop and validate a novel liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry procedure to analyze PEITC concentrations in human plasma and urine. Following hexane extraction, ammonia was added to samples to derivatize PEITC to phenethylthiourea. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a C(18) column with acetonitrile/5 mM formic acid (60:40, v/v) as the mobile phase followed by tandem mass spectrometry detection in multiple reaction monitoring mode. Deuterium-labeled PEITC was used as the internal standard. The detection limit was 2 nM and calibration curves were linear from 7.8 to 2000 nM. The intra- and inter-day coefficients of variation were less than 5 and 10%, respectively. The intra- and inter-day accuracies ranged from 101.0 to 104.2% and from 102.8 to 118.6%, respectively. The recovery from spiked human plasma and urine ranged from 100.3 to 113.5% and from 98.3 to 103.9%, respectively. The assay was used to measure PEITC in plasma and urine samples obtained from subjects after consumption of 100g of watercress. This novel assay represents the first analytical method with the sensitivity and specificity to determine plasma and urine concentrations of PEITC.
12520632	Tolbutamide, flurbiprofen, and losartan as probes of CYP2C9 activity in humans. The metabolic activity of CYP2C9 in 16 subjects expressing four different genotypes (CYP2C9*1/*1, *1/*2, *1/*3, and *2/*2) was evaluated. Single oral doses of tolbutamide, flurbiprofen, and losartan were administered in a randomized, crossover design. Plasma and urine were collected over 24 hours. The urinary metabolic ratio and amount of metabolite(s) excreted were correlated with formation clearance. The formation clearance of tolbutamide to its CYP2C9-mediated metabolites demonstrated a stronger association with genotype compared to flurbiprofen and losartan, respectively (r2 = 0.64 vs. 0.53 vs. 0.42). A statistically significant correlation was observed between formation clearance of tolbutamide and the 0- to 12-hour urinary amount of 4'-hydroxytolbutamide and carboxytolbutamide (r = 0.84). Compared to tolbutamide, the correlations observed between the respective measures of flurbiprofen and losartan metabolism were not as strong. Tolbutamide is a better CYP2C9 probe than flurbiprofen and losartan, and the 0- to 12-hour amount of 4'-hydroxytolbutamide and carboxytolbutamide is the best urinary measure of its metabolism.
11829671	Metabolism and lack of DNA reactivity of the mycotoxin ochratoxin a in cultured rat and human primary hepatocytes. It is still unclear whether the carcinogenic mycotoxin ochratoxin A (OTA) is bioactivated to DNA-binding metabolites in rodents and humans. Therefore, we have incubated cultured rat and human primary hepatocytes with noncytotoxic concentrations of (3)H-OTA ranging from 10(-7) to 10(-5) M for 8 h and determined its metabolism and covalent DNA binding. In rat hepatocytes, OTA was metabolized to small amounts of three products, which were further studied by electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS/MS techniques. In addition to 4-hydroxy-OTA, which is a known product of OTA biotransformation, two novel metabolites were detected and tentatively identified as hexose and pentose conjugates of OTA. The in vitro induction with 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC) increased the formation of 4-hydroxy-OTA but did not alter the formation of the conjugated metabolites. No covalent binding of (3)H-OTA or its metabolites to DNA was observed in rat hepatocytes with or without 3MC induction with a limit of detection of 2 adducts per 10(9) nucleotides. However, the cellular ratio of reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione was significantly decreased by treatment with OTA. In cultured human hepatocytes, (3)H-OTA was only very poorly metabolized, and no covalent DNA binding was observed. In conclusion, the results of this in vitro study do not support the notion that OTA has the potential to undergo metabolic activation and form covalent DNA adducts in rodents and humans.
11317702	Study on the cytochrome P-450- and glutathione-dependent biotransformation of trichloroethylene in humans. To investigate in humans the contribution of the cytochrome P-450- and glutathione-dependent biotransformation of trichloroethylene (TRI) under controlled repeated exposure in volunteers, and under occupational conditions. Volunteers were exposed to TRI, using repeated 15 min exposures at 50 and 100 ppm. This exposure schedule resulted in internal doses of 1.30 and 2.40 mmol of TRI respectively. Urine samples were collected for a minimum of 45 h. Urine samples were also collected from occupationally exposed workers. The samples were analysed for the known human metabolites of TRI, trichloroethanol (TCE), trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and both regio-isomeric forms of the mercapturic acid N-acetyl-S-(dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine (DCV-NAC), and for (dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine (DCVC). In order to further elucidate the metabolism of TRI in humans, we analysed samples for dichloroacetic acid and for the proposed break-down products of 1,2 and 2,2-dichlorovinyl-L-cysteine after deamination: the S-conjugates of 3-mercaptolactic acid, 3-mercaptopyruvic acid and 2-mercaptoacetic acid. None of the glutathione metabolites was found in urine of volunteers. In workers occupationally exposed to TRI at levels between 0.4 and 21 ppm [8-h time-weighted average (TWA)], levels of DCV-NAC in urine samples collected at the end of the 4th working day and also next morning were below detection limit (0.04 mumol/l). This confirms the findings of Bernauer et al. (1996) that these metabolites are excreted at very low levels in humans. Urinary levels of DCVC and six postulated metabolites of dichlorovinyl-S-cysteine conjugates via deamination were also below 0.04 mumol/l, indicating that at most 0.05% of the dose is excreted in the form of these metabolites. These data further strengthen the argument for a very low activity of glutathione-mediated metabolism for chronically exposed workers. This study gives additional data which indicate that glutathione-mediated metabolism is of minor importance in humans exposed to TRI. In spite of indications to the contrary, significant metabolism of the cysteine conjugate via beta-lyase, which could result in a toxic metabolite, cannot be ruled out completely.
12760896	Prodrugs of cephalosporin RWJ-333441 (MC-04,546) with improved aqueous solubility. To improve the aqueous solubility of anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin RWJ-333441 for parenteral administration, acyl derivatives of the C-3 primary amino group were prepared and evaluated for solubility, cleavage in serum in vitro, and conversion to RWJ-333441 in vivo. Improved solubility at physiologic pH values and release of RWJ-333441 in vitro and in vivo were observed for several prodrugs, including the aspartate derivative RWJ-333442.
14581066	Metabolism of the new designer drug alpha-pyrrolidinopropiophenone (PPP) and the toxicological detection of PPP and 4'-methyl-alpha-pyrrolidinopropiophenone (MPPP) studied in rat urine using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. R,S-alpha-pyrrolidinopropiophenone (PPP) is a new designer drug with assumed amphetamine-like effects which has appeared on the illicit drug market. The aim of this study was to identify the PPP metabolites using solid-phase extraction, ethylation or acetylation as well as to develop a toxicological detection procedure in urine using solid-phase extraction, trimethylsilylation and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Analysis of urine samples of rats treated with PPP revealed that PPP was extensively metabolized by hydroxylation of the pyrrolidine ring with subsequent dehydrogenation to the corresponding lactam, hydroxylation of the aromatic ring in position 4' or double dealkylation of the pyrrolidine ring to the corresponding primary amine (cathinone) partly followed by reduction of the keto group to the corresponding secondary alcohol (norephedrines). As cathinone and the norephedrine diastereomers are also formed after intake of other drugs of abuse or medicaments, special attention must be paid to the detection of the unequivocal metabolite 2"-oxo-PPP as an unambiguous proof for the intake of PPP. The hydroxy groups were found to be partly conjugated. Based on these data, PPP could be detected in urine via its metabolites by full-scan GC-MS using mass chromatography for screening and library search for identification by comparison of the spectra with reference spectra. The same toxicological detection procedure can be applied to other designer drugs of the pyrrolidinophenone type, like MOPPP, MDPPP, MPHP, and MPPP. The detection of the latter will also be presented here.
1381906	Species differences and interindividual variation in liver microsomal cytochrome P450 2A enzymes: effects on coumarin, dicumarol, and testosterone oxidation. Antibody against purified CYP2A1 recognizes two rat liver microsomal P450 enzymes, CYP2A1 and CYP2A2, that catalyze the 7 alpha- and 15 alpha-hydroxylation of testosterone, respectively. In human liver microsomes, this antibody recognizes a single protein, namely CYP2A6, which catalyzes the 7-hydroxylation of coumarin. To examine species differences in CYP2A function, liver microsomes from nine mammalian species (rat, mouse, hamster, rabbit, guinea pig, cat, dog, cynomolgus monkey, and human) were tested for their ability to catalyze the 7 alpha- and 15 alpha-hydroxylation of testosterone and the 7-hydroxylation of coumarin. Antibody against rat CYP2A1 recognized one or more proteins in liver microsomes from all mammalian species examined. However, liver microsomes from cat, dog, cynomolgus monkey, and human catalyzed negligible rates of testosterone 7 alpha- and/or 15 alpha-hydroxylation, whereas rat and cat liver microsomes catalyzed negligible rates of coumarin 7-hydroxylation. Formation of 7-hydroxycoumarin accounted for a different proportion of the coumarin metabolites formed by liver microsomes from each of the various species examined. 7-Hydroxycoumarin was the major metabolite (greater than 70%) in human and monkey, but only a minor metabolite (less than 1%) in rat. The 7-hydroxylation of coumarin by human liver microsomes was catalyzed by a single, high-affinity enzyme (Km 0.2-0.6 microM), which was markedly inhibited (greater than 95%) by antibody against rat CYP2A1. The rate of coumarin 7-hydroxylation varied approximately 17-fold among liver microsomes from 22 human subjects. This variation was highly correlated (r2 = 0.956) with interindividual differences in the levels of CYP2A6, as determined by immunoblotting. These results indicate that CYP2A6 is largely or entirely responsible for catalyzing the 7-hydroxylation of coumarin in human liver microsomes. Treatment of monkeys with phenobarbital or dexamethasone increased coumarin 7-hydroxylase activity, whereas treatment with beta-naphthoflavone caused a slight decrease. These results suggest that environmental factors can increase or decrease CYP2A expression in cynomolgus monkeys, which implies that environmental factors may be responsible for the large variation in CYP2A6 levels in humans, although genetic factors may also be important. In contrast to rats and mice, the expression of CYP2A enzymes in cynomolgus monkeys and humans was not sexually differentiated. Despite their structural similarity to coumarin, the anticoagulants dicumarol and warfarin do not appear to be substrates for CYP2A6. The overall rate of dicumarol metabolism varied approximately 5-fold among the human liver microsomal samples, but this variation correlated poorly (r2 = 0.126) with the variation observed in CYP2A6 levels and coumarin 7-hydroxylase activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
12883403	Pharmacokinetics and clinical pharmacodynamics of the new propofol prodrug GPI 15715 in volunteers. GPI 15715 (AQUAVAN injection) is a new water-soluble prodrug which is hydrolyzed to release propofol. The objectives of this first study in humans were to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and clinical pharmacodynamics of GPI 15715. Three groups of three healthy male volunteers (aged 19-35 y, 67-102 kg) received 290, 580, and 1,160 mg GPI 15715 as a constant rate infusion over 10 min. The plasma concentrations of GPI 15715 and propofol were measured from arterial and venous blood samples up to 24 h. Pharmacokinetics were analyzed with compartment models. Pharmacodynamics were assessed by clinical signs. GPI 15715 was well tolerated without pain on injection. Two subjects reported a transient unpleasant sensation of burning or tingling at start of infusion. Loss of consciousness was achieved in none with 290 mg and in one subject with 580 mg. After 1,160 mg, all subjects experienced loss of consciousness at propofol concentrations of 2.1 +/- 0.6 microg/ml. A two-compartment model for GPI 15715 (central volume of distribution, 0.07 l/kg; clearance, 7 ml. kg-1 min-1; terminal half-life, 46 min) and a three-compartment model for propofol (half-lives: 2.2, 20, 477 min) best described the data. The maximum decrease of blood pressure was 25%; the heart rate increased by approximately 35%. There were no significant laboratory abnormalities. Compared with propofol lipid emulsion, the potency seemed to be higher with respect to plasma concentration but was apparently less with respect to dose. Pharmacokinetic simulations showed a longer time to peak propofol concentration after a bolus dose and a longer context-sensitive half-time.
15722567	Determination of the urinary aglycone metabolites of vitamin K by HPLC with redox-mode electrochemical detection. We describe a method for the determination of the two major urinary metabolites of vitamin K as the methyl esters of their aglycone structures, 2-methyl-3-(3'-3'-carboxymethylpropyl)-1,4-naphthoquinone (5C-aglycone) and 2-methyl-3-(5'-carboxy-3'-methyl-2'-pentenyl)-1,4-naphthoquinone (7C-aglycone), by HPLC with electrochemical detection (ECD) in the redox mode. Urinary salts were removed by reversed-phase (C18) solid-phase extraction (SPE), and the predominantly conjugated vitamin K metabolites were hydrolyzed with methanolic HCl. The resulting carboxylic acid aglycones were quantitatively methylated with diazomethane and fractionated by normal-phase (silica) SPE. Final analysis was by reversed-phase (C18) HPLC with a methanol-aqueous mobile phase. Metabolites were detected by amperometric, oxidative ECD of their quinol forms, which were generated by postcolumn coulometric reduction at an upstream electrode. The assay gave excellent linearity (typically, r2 > or = 0.999) and high sensitivity with an on-column detection limit of < 3.5 fmol (< 1 pg). The interassay precision was typically 10%. Metabolite recovery was compared with that of an internal standard [2-methyl-3-(7'-carboxy-heptyl)-1,4-naphthoquinone] added to urine samples just before analysis. Using this methodology, we confirmed that the 5C- and 7C-aglycones were major catabolites of both phylloquinone (vitamin K1) and menaquinones (vitamin K2) in humans. We propose that the measurement of urinary vitamin K metabolite excretion is a candidate noninvasive marker of total vitamin K status.
12361741	Determination of N,N-dimethyltryptamine and beta-carboline alkaloids in human plasma following oral administration of Ayahuasca. Ayahuasca is a South American psychotropic beverage prepared from plants native to the Amazon River Basin. It combines the hallucinogenic agent and 5-HT(2A/2C) agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) with beta-carboline alkaloids showing monoamine oxidase-inhibiting properties. In the present paper, an analytical methodology for the plasma quantification of the four main alkaloids present in ayahuasca plus two major metabolites is described. DMT was extracted by liquid-liquid extraction with n-pentane and quantified by gas chromatography with nitrogen-phosphorus detection. Recovery was 74%, and precision and accuracy were better than 9.9%. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was 1.6 ng/ml. Harmine, harmaline, and tetrahydroharmine (THH), the three main beta-carbolines present in ayahuasca, and harmol and harmalol (O-demethylation metabolites of harmine and harmaline, respectively) were measured in plasma by means of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection. Sample preparation was accomplished by solid-phase extraction, which facilitated the automation of the process. All five beta-carbolines were measured using a single detector by switching wavelengths. Separation of harmol and harmalol required only slight changes in the chromatographic conditions. Method validation demonstrated good recoveries, above 87%, and accuracy and precision better than 13.4%. The LOQ was 0.5 ng/ml for harmine, 0.3 ng/ml for harmaline, 1.0 ng/ml for THH, and 0.3 ng/ml for harmol and harmalol. Good linearity was observed in the concentration ranges evaluated for DMT (2.5-50 ng/ml) and the beta-carbolines (0.3-100 ng/ml). The gas chromatography and HPLC methods described allowed adequate characterization of the pharmacokinetics of the four main alkaloids present in ayahuasca, and also of two major beta-carboline metabolites not previously described in the literature.
1505618	The pharmacokinetics of tiopronin and its principal metabolite (2-mercaptopropionic acid) after oral administration to healthy volunteers. We have studied the pharmacokinetics of tiopronin and its principal metabolite, 2-mercaptopropionic acid (2-MPA) in healthy volunteers after the oral administration of 500 mg (2 Acadione tablets), followed by simultaneous assay of the two compounds in plasma over a period of 48 h using a new method (emission of fluorescence after HPLC and post-column derivatization by pyrene-maleimide). The absorption of tiopronin was slow (tmax between 4 and 6 h) and the plasma concentrations subsequently fell biexponentially. The principal metabolite 2-MPA appeared later in the plasma (tmax between 10 and 12 h after a lag-time of 3 h) then disappeared monoexponentially. About 15% of the tiopronin was metabolized to 2-MPA.
21543556	Preclinical and clinical pharmacokinetics of PF-02413873, a nonsteroidal progesterone receptor antagonist. The recently discovered selective nonsteroidal progesterone receptor (PR) antagonist 4-[3-cyclopropyl-1-(methylsulfonylmethyl)-5-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]oxy-2,6-dimethylbenzonitrile (PF-02413873) was characterized in metabolism studies in vitro, in preclinical pharmacokinetics in rat and dog, and in an initial pharmacokinetic study in human volunteers. Clearance (CL) of PF-02413873 was found to be high in rat (84 ml · min(-1) · kg(-1)) and low in dog (3.8 ml · min(-1) · kg(-1)), consistent with metabolic stability determined in liver microsomes and hepatocytes in these species. In human, CL was low in relation to hepatic blood flow, consistent with metabolic stability in human in vitro systems, where identified metabolites suggested predominant cytochrome P450 (P450)-catalyzed oxidative metabolism. Prediction of CL using intrinsic CL determined in human liver microsomes (HLM), recombinant human P450 enzymes, and single species scaling (SSS) from pharmacokinetic studies showed that dog SSS and HLM scaling provided the closest estimates of CL of PF-02413873 in human. These CL estimates were combined with a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to predict pharmacokinetic profiles after oral suspension administration of PF-02413873 in fasted and fed states in human. Predicted plasma concentration versus time profiles were found to be similar to those observed in human over the PF-02413873 dose range 50 to 500 mg and captured the enhanced exposure in fed subjects. This case study of a novel nonsteroidal PR antagonist underlines the utility of PBPK modeling techniques in guiding prediction confidence and design of early clinical trials of novel chemical agents.
22867273	Absorption of TAK-491, a new angiotensin II receptor antagonist, in animals. The absorption process in animals of TAK-491, designed as ester-based prodrug with medoxomil moiety, was evaluated. In the plasma of rats and dogs, TAK-536, the pharmacologically active metabolite, was present as the main component with hardly detectable concentrations of TAK-491 after oral administration of TAK-491. In the rat portal plasma, TAK-536 was also present as the main component with hardly detectable concentrations of TAK-491 after jejunal loop injection of TAK-491, suggesting TAK-491 was absorbed from small intestine and hydrolyzed almost completely during absorption. Caco-2 study indicated the permeability of TAK-491 was improved by prodrug modification and the compound could be mainly transferred as TAK-491. This is well consistent with the facts that the AUC and T(max) of TAK-536 after oral administration of TAK-491 were higher and shorter than those after oral administration of TAK-536 in dogs Hydrolysis of TAK-491 is observed not only by the intestinal and hepatic S9 fraction, but also by plasma and human serum albumin. However, medoxomil alcohol wasn't detected during the hydrolysis of TAK-491. These metabolic features of TAK-491 were similar to olmesartan medoxomil, suggesting the hydrolytic pathway and enzymes for TAK-491 when catalyzing to TAK-536 would be the same as olmesartan medoxomil.
16979892	Biochemical aromatization of 2-methyleneandrostenedione: stereochemistry of hydrogen removal at the C-1 position. To explore a stereochemistry of hydrogen removal at C-1 of the powerful aromatase inhibitor 2-methyleneandrostenedione (1), of which the A-ring conformation is markedly different from that of the natural substrate androstenedione (AD), in the course of the aromatase-catalyzed A-ring aromatization producing 2-methylestrone (2), we synthesized [1alpha-2H]labeled steroid 1 and its [1beta-2H]stereoisomer, and the metabolic fate of the C-1 deuterium in aromatization was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in each. Parallel experiments with the natural substrates [1alpha-2H] and [1beta-2H]ADs were also carried out. The GC-MS analysis indicated that 2-methyl estrogen 2 produced from [1alpha-2H]labeled substrate 1 retained completely the 1alpha-deuterium (1beta-H elimination), while product 2 obtained from [1beta-2H]isomer 1 lost completely the 1beta-deuterium. Stereospecific 1beta-hydrogen elimination was also observed in the parallel experiments with the labeled ADs as established previously. The results indicate that biochemical aromatization of the 2-methylene steroid 1 proceeds through the 1beta-hydrogen removal concomitant with cleavage of the C(10)-C(19) bond, yielding 1(10),4-dienone 9, in a similar manner to that involved in AD aromatization. This would give additional evidence for the stereomechanisms for the last step of aromatization of AD, requiring the stereospecific 1beta-hydrogen abstraction and cleavage of the C(10)-C(19) bond, and for the enolization of a carbonyl group at C-3 in the A-ring aromatization.
21515093	A sensitive high performance liquid chromatography-positive electrospray tandem mass spectrometry method for N7-[2-[(2-hydroxyethyl)thio]-ethyl]guanine determination. A simple, fast, sensitive and robust method for the determination of the sulfur mustard (SM) exposure biomarker-N(7)-[2-[(2-hydroxyethyl)thio]-ethyl]guanine (HETEG) was reported using high-performance liquid chromatography-positive electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS), working in multiple reaction monitor (MRM) mode. The method provided limit of detection of 0.330 ng/mL and lower limit of quantitation of 0.940 ng/mL. The method was linearly calibrated from 0.940 ng/mL to 587 ng/mL with precisions of 3.5-14.5%, and accuracies of 88-112%. The recovery varied from 102% to 118%. HETEG spiked in DNA hydrolytes isolated from the human whole blood was stable after five freeze/thaw cycles and 35-day frozen at -20°C. For the exposed biological samples, alkylated DNA was isolated from SM-treated human whole blood, followed by DNA digestion and adducts enrichment, the resulting alkylation base was determined. By the procedure, the HETEG level in DNA hydrolytes isolated from the human whole blood exposure to 312 ng/mL SM was detected successfully.
15257075	Studies on the human metabolism and the toxicologic detection of the cough suppressant dropropizine in urine using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Studies are described on the metabolism and the toxicologic analysis of the nonopioid cough suppressant dropropizine [R,S-3-(4-phenyl-1-piperazinyl)1,2-propandiol, DRO] in human urine using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The metabolism studies showed that DRO was metabolized in humans mainly by hydroxylation of the aromatic ring, by N-dealkylation of the parent drug and of the hydroxyl-metabolite to the corresponding N-phenylpiperazines, and by degradation of the piperazine moiety. The authors' systematic toxicologic analysis (STA) procedure using full-scan GC-MS after acid hydrolysis, liquid-liquid extraction, and microwave-assisted acetylation allowed the unambiguous detection of DRO and its above-mentioned metabolites in human urine up to about 32 hours after intake of a single common therapeutic dose. The target analytes were found to be the parent compound DRO (earlier phase of excretion) and the hydroxylated metabolite para-hydroxy-DRO (later phase of excretion). Both allowed unambiguous detection of an intake of DRO and also differentiation from other phenylpiperazine derivatives.
12407434	Relationship between irreversible alopecia and exposure to cyclophosphamide, thiotepa and carboplatin (CTC) in high-dose chemotherapy. Reversible alopecia is a commonly observed, important and distressing complication of chemotherapy. Permanent alopecia, however, is rare after standard-dose therapy, but has occasionally been observed after high-dose chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, thiotepa and carboplatin (CTC). We evaluated the relationships between total exposure to these three compounds and their different metabolites in the high-dose CTC regimen, and the subsequent development of irreversible alopecia. Twenty-four patients received two or three courses of high-dose CTC, each followed by peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation. Plasma levels of cyclophosphamide, its active metabolite 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide, thiotepa, its active metabolite tepa, and carboplatin were determined, and the area-under-the-plasma concentration-versus-time curves (AUC) of the compounds were calculated. Eight of the 24 patients included in the study developed permanent alopecia, while seven had normal hair regrowth and nine patients developed incomplete and/or thin hair regrowth. The carboplatin AUC and the summed AUC of thiotepa and tepa were both significantly associated with increasing irreversibility of hair loss. These results suggest that high exposure to carboplatin and the sum of the thiotepa and tepa exposure may lead to the development of permanent alopecia. This knowledge could guide therapeutic drug monitoring in order to prevent the occurrence of permanent alopecia and thereby improve the patients' quality of life.
17484521	Metabolism of (-)-fenchone by CYP2A6 and CYP2B6 in human liver microsomes. The in vitro metabolism of (-)-fenchone was examined in human liver microsomes and recombinant enzymes. The biotransformation of (-)-fenchone was investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. (-)-Fenchone was found to be oxidized to 6-exo-hydroxyfenchone, 6-endo-hydroxyfenchone and 10-hydroxyfenchone by human liver microsomal P450 enzymes. The formation of metabolites was determined by the relative abundance of mass fragments and retention times on gas chromatography (GC). CYP2A6 and CYP2B6 were major enzymes involved in the hydroxylation of (-)-fenchone by human liver microsomes, based on the following lines of evidence. First, of 11 recombinant human P450 enzymes tested, CYP2A6 and CYP2B6 catalysed the oxidation of (-)-fenchone. Second, oxidation of (-)-fenchone was inhibited by thioTEPA and (+)-menthofuran. Finally, there was a good correlation between CYP2A6, CYP2B6 contents and (-)-fenchone hydroxylation activities in liver microsomes of 11 human samples. CYP2A6 may be more important than CYP2B6 in human liver microsomes. Kinetic analysis showed that the Vmax/Km values for (-)-fenchone 6-endo-, 6-exo- and 10-hydroxylation catalysed by liver microsomes of human sample HG-03 were 24.3, 44.0 and 1.3nM(-1)min(-1) , respectively. Human recombinant CYP2A6 and CYP2B6 catalysed (-)-fenchone 6-exo-hydroxylation with Vmax values of 2.7 and 12.9 nmol min(-1) nmol(-1) P450 and apparent Km values of 0.18 and 0.15 mM and (-)-fenchone 6-endo-hydroxylation with Vmax values of 1.26 and 5.33nmolmin(-l) nmol(-1) P450 with apparent Km values of 0.29 and 0.26mM. (-)-Fenchone 10-hydroxylation was catalysed by CYP2B6 with Km and Vmax values of 0.2 mM and 10.66 nmol min(-1) nmol(-1) P450, respectively.
17899082	Concentrations of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine (FdCyd) and its cytotoxic metabolites in plasma of patients treated with FdCyd and tetrahydrouridine (THU). Although the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine (FdCyd), is being evaluated clinically, it must be combined with the cytidine deaminase inhibitor tetrahydrouridine (THU) to prevent rapid metabolism of FdCyd to the pharmacologically active, yet unwanted, metabolites 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FdUrd), 5-fluorouracil (FU), and 5-fluorouridine (FUrd). We assessed plasma concentrations of FdCyd and metabolites in patients receiving FdCyd and THU. We validated an LC-MS/MS assay, developed for a preclinical study, to quantitate FdCyd and metabolites in human plasma. Patients were treated with five daily, 3-h infusions of FdCyd at doses of 5-80 mg/m(2) with 350 mg/m(2) THU. Plasma was obtained during, and before the end of infusions on days 1 and 5. The lower limits of quantitation for FU, FdUrd, FUrd, FC and FdCyd were 1, 1.5, 10, 3, and 10 ng/ml, respectively. Plasma FdCyd increased with dose, from 19-96 ng/ml at 5 mg/m(2) to 1,600-1,728 ng/ml at 80 mg/m(2). FdUrd was undetectable in patients treated with FdCyd doses <20 mg/m(2), and increased from 2.3 ng/ml at 20 mg/m(2) to 3.5-5.7 ng/ml at 80 mg/m(2). FU increased from 1.2-5.5 ng/ml at 5 mg/m(2) to 6.0-12 ng/ml at 80 mg/m(2). By co-administering FdCyd with THU, FdCyd plasma concentrations were achieved that are known to inhibit DNA methylation in vitro. The accompanying plasma FU and FdUrd concentrations are <10% those observed after therapeutic infusions of FU or FdUrd, while FdCyd levels are well above those required to inhibit methylation in vitro. Therefore, inhibition of DNA methylation with FdCyd and THU appears feasible.
15716476	Thiamethoxam induced mouse liver tumors and their relevance to humans. Part 2: species differences in response. Thiamethoxam is a neonicotinoid insecticide that is not a mutagen, but it did cause a significant increase in liver cancer in mice, but not rats, in chronic dietary feeding studies. Previous studies in mice have characterized a carcinogenicity mode of action that involved depletion of plasma cholesterol, cell death, both as single cell necrosis and as apoptosis, and sustained increases in cell replication rates. In a study reported in this article, female rats have been exposed to thiamethoxam in their diet at concentrations of 0, 1000, and 3000 ppm for 50 weeks, a study design directly comparable to the mouse study in which the mode of action changes were characterized. In rats, thiamethoxam had no adverse effects on either the biochemistry or histopathology of the liver at any time point during the study. Cell replication rates were not increased, in fact they were significantly decreased at several time points. The lack of effect on the rat liver is entirely consistent with the lack of liver tumor formation in the two-year cancer bioassay. Comparisons of the metabolism of thiamethoxam in rats and mice have shown that concentrations of the parent chemical were either similar or higher in rat blood than in mouse blood in both single dose and the dietary studies strongly indicating that thiamethoxam itself is unlikely to play a role in the development of liver tumors. In contrast, the concentrations of the two metabolites, CGA265307 and CGA330050, shown to play a role in the development of liver damage in the mouse, were 140- (CGA265307) and 15- (CGA330050) fold lower in rats than in mice following either a single oral dose, or dietary administration of thiamethoxam for up to 50 weeks. Comparisons of the major metabolic pathways of thiamethoxam in vitro using mouse, rat, and human liver fractions have shown that metabolic rates in humans are lower than those in the rat suggesting that thiamethoxam is unlikely to pose a hazard to humans exposed to this chemical at the low concentrations found in the environment or during its use as an insecticide.
2333717	The metabolism of eugenol in man. 1. The metabolism of eugenol (4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-allylbenzene) was investigated in male and female healthy volunteers. It was rapidly absorbed and metabolized after oral administration and was almost completely excreted in the urine within 24 h. Unmetabolized eugenol excreted in urine amounted to less than 0.1% of the dose. 2. The urine contained conjugates of eugenol and of nine metabolites. The structures of these metabolites, elucidated using g.l.c.-mass spectrometry, and by comparison with synthetic reference compounds, were identified as: eugenol, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl-propane, cis- and trans-isoeugenol, 3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-propylene-1,2-oxide, 3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-propane-1,2-diol, and 3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-propionic acid. 3. The structures of the following metabolites were tentatively deduced from mass spectra only, as reference compounds were not available: 3-hydroxy-3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-allylbenzene, 3-(6?-mercapto-4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-propane, and 2-hydroxy-3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-propionic acid. 4. The amounts of the individual metabolites excreted were determined by g.l.c. Some 95% of the dose was recovered in the urine, most of which (greater than 99%) consisted of phenolic conjugates; 50% of the conjugated metabolites were eugenol-glucuronide and sulphate. Other metabolic routes observed were the epoxide-diol pathway, synthesis of a thiophenol and of a substituted propionic acid, allylic oxidation, and migration of the double bond.
7858703	Determination of 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide in plasma, as 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone derivative of aldophosphamide, by liquid chromatography. A reversed-phase liquid chromatographic method to determine the concentration of 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide, a labile cytotoxic metabolite of cyclophosphamide, in plasma is described. In order to stabilize 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide, as well as to increase the selectivity and the sensitivity, a 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone derivative was formed. Plasma proteins were precipitated with acetonitrile prior to the derivatization with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine at pH 2. The derivatization was performed at 50 degrees C for 5 min. The chromatographic system consisted of an octadecyl silica column and a mobile phase containing phosphate buffer and acetonitrile. Quantitation was performed using an UV detector operating at 357 nm. Optimal derivatization was obtained by adding 0.2 ml 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (3.8 mg/ml) to 0.5 ml of the deproteinized plasma supernatant. The relative recovery of 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide from plasma is > or = 97%. Concentration levels down to 22 mg/ml of 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide in plasma could be determined with a R.S.D. of about 13%. No degradation of the derivative was observed after 24 h at room temperature. The t1/2 for 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide in blood is ca. 4 min at 37 degrees C, whereas 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide is stable for at least 1 h at 4 degrees C. Application of the method for the pharmacokinetic monitoring of 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide is described.
8585111	Measurement of AM19 and other cyclosporine metabolites in the blood of liver transplant patients with stable liver function. Chronic renal impairment represents on of the major side effects of cyclosporine (CsA) immunotherapy for organ transplantation. The clinical relevance of selective measurement of CsA metabolites to correlating nephrotoxic activities remains inconclusive. A relatively simple and reliable method was developed to measure AM19 and four other CsA metabolites in whole blood by sequential solid-phase extraction and reversed phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The procedures were modified from a well-established method developed to quantitate CsA, the most important difference being in the elution step. The use of acetonitrile/methanol instead of ethylacetate/isopropanol in the elution procedure enhanced the absolute recoveries of metabolites. The washing steps were also slightly modified to recover AM19 quantitatively and specifically. Isocratic chromatographic conditions allowed very good separation of AM19, AM1, AM9, AM1c, AM4N, CsA, and the internal standard, cyclosporin C (CsC). Analytical recoveries for CsA and five of its metabolites ranged from 82 to 92%. No interfering substance from the matrix was found. The detection limit was 10 micrograms/l. The objectives of this study were to measure trough concentration of AM19 in whole blood, expressed as percentage of total metabolites plus parent CsA, and to determine if the blood level of AM19 could be used to predict subsequent changes in serum creatinine level in liver transplant patients. Twenty-three patients, who underwent liver transplantation between January and June 1993 were studied. Trough concentration of CsA in whole blood, serum creatinine and liver enzymes were constantly monitored. AM19 level was determined 5-8 months after transplantation. Preliminary results suggest an inverse relationship between AM19 and serum creatine levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
20026321	Human benzene metabolism following occupational and environmental exposures. We previously reported evidence that humans metabolize benzene via two enzymes, including a hitherto unrecognized high-affinity enzyme that was responsible for an estimated 73% of total urinary metabolites [sum of phenol (PH), hydroquinone (HQ), catechol (CA), E,E-muconic acid (MA), and S-phenylmercapturic acid (SPMA)] in nonsmoking females exposed to benzene at sub-saturating (ppb) air concentrations. Here, we used the same Michaelis-Menten-like kinetic models to individually analyze urinary levels of PH, HQ, CA and MA from 263 nonsmoking Chinese women (179 benzene-exposed workers and 84 control workers) with estimated benzene air concentrations ranging from less than 0.001-299 ppm. One model depicted benzene metabolism as a single enzymatic process (1-enzyme model) and the other as two enzymatic processes which competed for access to benzene (2-enzyme model). We evaluated model fits based upon the difference in values of Akaike's Information Criterion (DeltaAIC), and we gauged the weights of evidence favoring the two models based upon the associated Akaike weights and Evidence Ratios. For each metabolite, the 2-enzyme model provided a better fit than the 1-enzyme model with DeltaAIC values decreasing in the order 9.511 for MA, 7.379 for PH, 1.417 for CA, and 0.193 for HQ. The corresponding weights of evidence favoring the 2-enzyme model (Evidence Ratios) were: 116.2:1 for MA, 40.0:1 for PH, 2.0:1 for CA and 1.1:1 for HQ. These results indicate that our earlier findings from models of total metabolites were driven largely by MA, representing the ring-opening pathway, and by PH, representing the ring-hydroxylation pathway. The predicted percentage of benzene metabolized by the putative high-affinity enzyme at an air concentration of 0.001 ppm was 88% based upon urinary MA and was 80% based upon urinary PH. As benzene concentrations increased, the respective percentages of benzene metabolized to MA and PH by the high-affinity enzyme decreased successively to 66 and 77% at 0.1 ppm, 20 and 58% at 1 ppm, and 2.7 and 17% at 10 ppm. This indicates that the putative high-affinity enzyme was active primarily below 1 ppm and favored the ring-opening pathway.
14962724	Phase IB and pharmacological study of the novel taxane BMS-184476 in combination with doxorubicin. The aim of this study was to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the pharmacological profile of the paclitaxel analogue BMS-184476 given once every 3 weeks, or on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks (d1&8), in combination with a fixed dose of 50 mg/m(2) of Doxorubicin (Doxo) administered on day 1 of a 21-day cycle. Adult patients with advanced solid malignancies received escalating doses of BMS-184476 infused over 1 h after bolus Doxo. Pharmacokinetics (PK) of BMS-184476, Doxo and metabolites were investigated. The effect of BMS-184476 on doxorubicinol formation was studied in the cytosol from human myocardium. The MTD of 3-weekly BMS-184476 was 30 mg/m(2). The MTD/recommended Phase II dose was 35 mg/m(2)/week (70 mg/m(2) per cycle) in the d1&8 schedule. The dose-limiting toxicity was neutropenia for both schedules. Other toxicities were loss of appetite, asthenia, and mild, cumulative peripheral neuropathy. The objective response rate in 17 previously untreated or minimally pretreated patients with breast cancer treated at 35 mg/m(2)/week of BMS-184476 was 59% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 33-82%). Two of the 7 patients not responding to the study regimen later responded to Doxo and paclitaxel. Plasma disposition of BMS-184476 at 30, 35 and 40 mg/m(2) was linear without evidence of a PK interaction with Doxo. In studies with cytosol from human myocardium, the formation of cardiotoxic doxorubicinol was not enhanced by BMS-184476. Dosing of BMS-184476 for 2 consecutive weeks allowed the administration of larger doses of the taxane with a promising antitumour activity in patients with untreated or minimally pretreated breast cancer. The higher than expected myelotoxicity of the 3-weekly schedule is unexplained by the investigated interactions. Lack of enhanced doxorubicinol formation in human myocardium is consistent with the cardiac safety of the regimen.
2876899	Comparative single dose and steady-state pharmacokinetics of bevantolol in young and elderly subjects. The pharmacokinetics of bevantolol were examined following single and repeated oral doses to young and elderly volunteers. Following administration of a single 200-mg bevantolol tablet mean maximum plasma bevantolol concentrations in young and elderly subjects were 1690 ng/ml and 1810 ng/ml, respectively. Maximum bevantolol concentrations occurred approximately 1.1 h postdose in both young and elderly subjects. There were no significant differences in mean steady state bevantolol concentrations on Day 14 between young and elderly subjects. However, disproportionate increases in Cmax, and in AUC, but not in tmax values were observed between Days 1 and 14. On Days 1 and 14, most young and elderly subjects exhibited monoexponential decline in bevantolol plasma concentrations after absorption phase. In those subjects Day 14 elimination half-lives in young and elderly were 1.9 and 2.2 h, respectively. In subjects who exhibited biexponential decline in bevantolol, an age effect in elimination became apparent, on Day 14 elimination half-lives were 5.7 and 11.2 h in young and elderly subjects, respectively. Bevantolol Metabolite III concentrations were observed in plasma of some subjects during the first 6 h after dosing. At steady-state AUC (0-ldc) values for the metabolite were less than 2% those of bevantolol. Bevantolol plasma levels accumulate to a small extent with repeated 200 mg daily doses. This is probably due to the contribution of a late and more persistent terminal elimination phase that was discernable in only certain individuals.
15286088	Influence of genetic variants in UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 on the in vivo glucuronidation of SN-38. The uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 and 1A9 isoforms are involved in the phase II biotransformation of the irinotecan metabolite, SN-38. Recently, several variants in the UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 genes have been described with altered functionality in vitro. The aim of this study was to evaluate the functional consequence of the UGT1A1(TA)(7)TAA (UGT1A1(*)28), UGT1A9 766G>A (D256N; UGT1A9(*)5), and UGT1A9 98T>C (M33T; UGT1A9(*)3) variants in Caucasian patients treated with irinotecan. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed after the first course of irinotecan in 47 males and 47 females. The mean (SD) area under the curves (AUCs) of irinotecan and SN-38 were 20,348 +/- 6466 ng x h/mL and 629 +/- 370 ng x h/mL, respectively, which is in line with earlier findings. For UGT1A9(*)5,novariant alleles were observed, whereas for UGT1A9(*)3, 1 patient with the variant allele was found (allele frequency, 0.633%). The distribution of the UGT1A1(*)28 variant showed 44 wild-type patients (Wt), 37 heterozygotes (Het), and 5 homozygotes (Var). The median AUC ratio of SN-38G to SN-38 was significantly reduced in carriers of the variant UGT1A1(*)28 allele (7.00 [Wt] vs. 6.26 [Het] vs. 2.51 [Var]; p =.022). It is concluded that UGT1A9 functional variants are rare in Caucasians and likely to be clinically insignificant in irinotecan regimens. Screening for the UGT1A1(*)28 polymorphism may identify patients with altered SN-38 pharmacokinetics.
17596106	Effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide. To investigate the effects of steady-state dosing of fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 and CYP2C19, on the pharmacokinetics of roflumilast, an oral, once-daily phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor and its pharmacodynamically active metabolite roflumilast N-oxide. In an open-label, non-randomised, one-sequence, two-period, two-treatment crossover study, 14 healthy subjects received a single oral dose of roflumilast 500 microg on study day 1. After a 6-day washout period, repeated doses of fluvoxamine 50 mg once daily were given from days 8 to 21. On day 15, roflumilast 500 microg and fluvoxamine 50 mg were taken concomitantly. Percentage ratios of test/reference (reference: roflumilast alone; test: roflumilast plus steady-state fluvoxamine) of geometric means and their 90% confidence intervals for area under the plasma concentration-time curve, maximum plasma concentration (roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide) and plasma clearance of roflumilast were calculated. Upon co-administration with steady-state fluvoxamine, the exposure to roflumilast as well as roflumilast N-oxide increased by a factor of 2.6 and 1.5, respectively. Roflumilast plasma clearance decreased by a factor of 2.6, from 9.06 L/h (reference) to 3.53 L/h (test). The combined effect of fluvoxamine co-administration on roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide exposures resulted in a moderate (i.e. 59%) increase in total PDE4 inhibitory activity. Co-administration of roflumilast and fluvoxamine affects the disposition of roflumilast and its active metabolite roflumilast N-oxide most likely via a potent dual pathway inhibition of CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 by fluvoxamine. The exposure increases observed for roflumilast N-oxide are suggested to be attributable to CYP2C19 co-inhibition by fluvoxamine and thus, are not to be expected to occur when roflumilast is co-administered with more selective CYP1A2 inhibitors.
15363588	Dehydrocrotonin and its derivative, dimethylamide-crotonin induce apoptosis with lipid peroxidation and activation of caspases-2, -6 and -9 in human leukemic cells HL60. A variety of stimuli can induce cells to undergo apoptosis, with one of the most reproducible inducers being mild oxidative stress following exposure to anticancer agents. Apoptosis involves events mediated by cysteine proteases (caspases) that are classified as initiators (-8, -9 and -12) or executors (-2, -3, -6 and -7). In this study, we examined the mechanisms of apoptosis induced by dehydrocrotonin (DHC), a diterpene lactone isolated from the Amazonian plant Croton cajucara, and its synthetic derivative, dimethylamide-crotonin (DCR), in human HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. Flow cytometric analysis of HL60 cells after treatment for 72 h showed that DCR- and DHC-induced apoptosis, with maximum cell death at a concentration of 250 microM for both compounds. DCR and DHC were effective in triggering the activation of caspases-2, -6 and -9. The level of reduced glutathione (GSH) decreased, whereas there was an increase in thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) production and in mitochondrial swelling. These effects on mitochondrial swelling, GSH content and lipid peroxidation were abolished by cyclosporine A, an inhibitor of the membrane permeability transition. The cytotoxicity of DHC and DCR was prevented by a high concentration of GSH (15 mM) in the culture medium. These results indicate that DCR and DHC produced apoptosis partly by oxidative stress-induced lipid peroxidation, which triggered the caspase cascade, that lead to apoptotic cell death in HL60 cells. Based on the pattern of caspase activation, on the increase in mitochondrial swelling and on the inhibitory action of cyclosporine A, we conclude that DCR and DHC triggered apoptosis in HL60 cells probably through cytochrome c release and apoptosome formation.
15256747	Passive cutaneous anaphylaxis-inhibitory action of tectorigenin, a metabolite of tectoridin by intestinal microflora. Tectoridin isolated from the flowers of Pueraria thunbergiana (Leguminosae) are metabolized to tectorigenin by human intestinal microflora. When tectoridin was orally administered to rats, tectorigenin, but not tectoridin, was detected in urine after beta-glucuronidase hydrolysis. The main metabolite tectorigenin potently inhibited the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reaction and inhibited in vitro the release of beta-hexosaminidase from RBL-2H3 cells induced by IgE. These results suggest that tectoridin is a prodrug, which can be transformed into the active agent tectorigenin by human intestinal bacteria and can be a candidate for antiallergic agent.
21726172	Drug interaction potential of toremifene and N-desmethyltoremifene with multiple cytochrome P450 isoforms. Toremifene is an effective agent for the treatment of breast cancer in postmenopausal women and is being evaluated for its ability to prevent bone fractures in men with prostate cancer taking androgen deprivation therapy. Due to the potential for drug-drug interactions, the ability of toremifene and its primary circulating metabolite N-desmethyltoremifene (NDMT) to inhibit nine human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes was determined using human liver microsomes. Induction of CYP1A2 and 3A4 by toremifene was also investigated in human hepatocytes. Toremifene did not significantly inhibit CYP1A2 or 2D6. However, toremifene is a competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4, non-competitive inhibitor of CYP2A6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19 and 2E1 and mixed-type inhibitor of CYP2B6. CYP inhibition by NDMT was similar in magnitude to toremifene. Toremifene did not induce CYP1A2 but increased CYP3A4 monooxygenase activity and gene expression in drug-exposed human primary hepatocytes. Although clinical doses of toremifene produce steady state exposures to toremifene and NDMT that may be sufficient to cause pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions with other drugs metabolised by CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, these data indicate that toremifene is unlikely to play a role in clinical drug-drug interactions with substrate drugs of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6.
16510126	Oxidative metabolism of 5-methoxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine (Foxy) by human liver microsomes and recombinant cytochrome P450 enzymes. In vitro quantitative studies of the oxidative metabolism of (5-methoxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine, 5-MeO-DIPT, Foxy) were performed using human liver microsomal fractions and recombinant CYP enzymes and synthetic 5-MeO-DIPT metabolites. 5-MeO-DIPT was mainly oxidized to O-demethylated (5-OH-DIPT) and N-deisopropylated (5-MeO-IPT) metabolites in pooled human liver microsomes. In kinetic studies, 5-MeO-DIPT O-demethylation showed monophasic kinetics, whereas its N-deisopropylation showed triphasic kinetics. Among six recombinant CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) expressed in yeast or insect cells, only CYP2D6 exhibited 5-MeO-DIPT O-demethylase activity, while CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 showed 5-MeO-DIPT N-deisopropylase activities. The apparent Km value of CYP2D6 was close to that for 5-MeO-DIPT O-demethylation, and the Km values of other CYP enzymes were similar to those of the low-Km (CYP2C19), intermediate-Km (CYP1A2, CYP2C8 and CYP3A4) and high-Km phases (CYP2C9), respectively, for N-deisopropylation in human liver microsomes. In inhibition studies, quinidine (1 microM), an inhibitor of CYP2D6, almost completely inhibited human liver microsomal 5-MeO-DIPT O-demethylation at a substrate concentration of 10 microM. Furafylline, a CYP1A2 inhibitor, quercetin, a CYP2C8 inhibitor, sulfaphenazole, a CYP2C9 inhibitor and ketoconazole, a CYP3A4 inihibitor (5 microM each) suppressed about 60%, 45%, 15% and 40%, respectively, of 5-MeO-DIPT N-deisopropylation at 50 microM substrate. In contrast, omeprazole (10 microM), a CYP2C19 inhibitor, suppressed only 10% of N-deisopropylation by human liver microsomes, whereas at the same concentration the inhibitor suppressed the reaction by recombinant CYP2C19 almost completely. These results indicate that CYP2D6 is the major 5-MeO-DIPT O-demethylase, and CYP1A2, CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 are the major 5-MeO-DIPT N-deisopropylase enzymes in the human liver.
18356270	Metabolism of boswellic acids in vitro and in vivo. Boswellia serrata resin dry extract is among the few herbal remedies designated with an orphan drug status for the treatment of peritumoral brain edema. In addition, boswellic acids (BAs), the main active ingredients of B. serrata extracts, have potent anti-inflammatory properties, and may represent promising agents for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Pharmacokinetic studies, however, revealed poor bioavailability, especially of 11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (KBA) and 3-acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (AKBA), the most potent BAs. To address the question of whether BAs are extensively metabolized, we determined the metabolic stability of KBA and AKBA in vitro, investigated the in vitro metabolism of BAs, and compared the metabolic profiles of KBA and AKBA with those obtained in rats in vivo. In rat liver microsomes and hepatocytes as well as in human liver microsomes, we found that KBA but not AKBA undergoes extensive phase I metabolism. Oxidation to hydroxylated metabolites is the principal metabolic route. In vitro, KBA yielded metabolic profiles similar to those obtained in vivo in rat plasma and liver, whereas no metabolites of AKBA could be identified in vivo. Furthermore, AKBA is not deacetylated to KBA. This study indicates that the efficacy of B. serrata extract may be enhanced by increasing the bioavailability of AKBA.
19797000	A routine feasible HPLC analysis for the anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sunitinib, and its main metabolite, SU12662, in plasma. Sunitinib is an oral inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinase receptors with antitumor activity in metastatic renal cell carcinoma. So far, published methods for analysis of sunitinib and its active metabolite (SU12662) in plasma are exclusively based on mass spectrometry. In the context of a large-scale feasibility pharmacokinetic analysis, we developed an original, simple, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay with UV detection. A stability study of sunitinib and SU12662 in different light exposure conditions is presented. Due to photo-instability of the compounds, blood sampling and the whole handling procedure have to be performed quickly and with minimal light exposure (6-7 lx). Following single organic extraction with tert-butyl methyl ether, HPLC analysis was performed on an ODS column and UV detection was monitored at 369 nm (run time 15 min). This assay was selective and sensitive enough (limit of detection approximately 1 ng/ml) to quantify minimal concentrations at steady state (Css min) of sunitinib and SU12662 in treated patients.
6777107	Tocainide kinetics and metabolism: effects of phenobarbital and substrates of glucuronyl transferase. Tocainide, a lidocaine congener with low hepatic clearance, is eliminated predominantly by formation of a novel glucuronide conjugate. This suggested the possibility of metabolic interactions with enzyme inducers or competitive substrates for glucuronyl transferase. The time course of tocainide blood concentration as well as the urinary excretion-time profiles of drug and principal metabolite (a glucuronide of tocainide carbaminic acid, TOCG) were examined in six subjects before and after 15 days on phenobarbital (100 mg/day). In another study, the effect of salicylamide and clofibrate on the time courses of tocainide and TOCG urinary excretion were examined in four of the same six subjects. After 600 mg tocainide HCl by mouth, the area under the tocainide blood concentration-time curve was 48.2 +/- 11.9 hr micrograms/ml for the control dose and 49.6 +/- 4.2 hr micrograms/ml (mean = SD) after phenobarbital. Percent of dose excreted unchanged in urine (46.0 +/- 4.9 and 43.4 +/- 5.6) and percent of dose excreted as TOCG (30.6 +/0 3.3 and 27.7 +/- 7.2) were not affected by phenobarbital (data presented as control and after phenobarbital). Because salicylamide has been reported to be a potent inhibitor of the glucuronidation of some drugs and because clofibrate yields metabolites that may be competitive inhibitors of tocainide conjugation, the two were given together with tocainide. Average percent of dose recovered in urine as unchanged tocainide in 24 hr was 26.8%, 28.3%, and 29.7% in the control, salicylamide, and clofibrate studies. The urinary excretion of TOCG was also not affected. It is concluded that under the conditions of our investigation, the principal urinary metabolite of tocainide, a glucuronide of tocainide carbaminic acid, is formed by a mechanism not subject to induction by phenobarbital or competitive inhibition by salicylamide or clofibrate.
22568631	Two novel creatinine adducts of andrographolide in human urine. Andrographolide is a major labdane diterpenoid of the traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine. Andrographis paniculate (Burm) Nees, is used in clinical situations in China mainly to treat fever, cold, and inflammation. In our previous study, fifteen metabolites of andrographolide were identified in human urine. However, there are still two other unknown metabolites. The aim of this study was to elucidate the structures of these two metabolites. 3. The two metabolites which are probably epimers were identified as creatinine adducts, and their structures were determined to be 14-deoxy-12-(creatinine-5-yl)-andrographolide-19-O-β-D-glucuronide A (Metabolite 1) and 14-deoxy-12-(creatinine-5-yl)-andrographolide-19-O-β-D-glucuronide B (Metabolite 2) by means of spectroscopic evidences. 4. It is for the first time that the formation of creatinine adducts as a novel metabolic pathway is reported. The mechanism was presumed that β-carbon (C-12) of α, β-unsaturated carbonyl was attacked by a 5-anion intermediate of creatinine formed through elimination of a proton, followed by the double bond migration from 12(13) to 13(14) and elimination of the hydroxyl group at C-14.
22543979	Postmortem distribution of tapentadol and N-desmethyltapentadol. Postmortem distribution concentrations of the pain medication tapentadol and its metabolite N-desmethyltapentadol are reported. Tapentadol (Nucynta®) is a synthetic mu-opioid receptor agonist that also has norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor action. The laboratory received two cases. Case 1: a 19-year-old, morbidly obese male with sudden unexpected death. Toxicology results revealed tapentadol (femoral blood: 0.77 mg/L, liver: 1.65 mg/kg), N-desmethyltapentadol (femoral blood: 0.07 mg/L, liver: 0.19 mg/kg), diazepam (femoral blood: 0.04 mg/L), nordiazepam (femoral blood: 0.06 mg/L) and amiodarone (femoral blood: 5.30 mg/L). Case 2: a 60-year-old female who died from complications following hip replacement. Only tapentadol (femoral blood: 0.26 mg/L, liver: 0.52 mg/kg) was found in the toxicology results. Quantitative results of tapentadol/N-desmethyltapentadol were achieved using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in multiple reactions monitoring mode. This is the first known distribution study of tapentadol and N-desmethyltapentadol values in postmortem cases.
16755044	Synthesis and pharmacological activity of the metabolites of Pratosartan. Three hydroxylated metabolites of 2-propyl-3-[2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-ylmethyl]-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-3H-cycloheptimidazol-4-one (Pratosartan), which is a selective angiotensin II receptor antagonist, were synthesized in confirmation of their structures and in studies of their pharmacological properties. An MTPA ester of the human main metabolite was identified with the synthesized compound by comparing (1)H-NMR spectra, MS spectra, and HPLC retention time. The structure of the human main metabolite was confirmed to be (S)-(-)-2-(1-hydroxypropyl)-3-[2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-ylmethyl]-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-3H-cycloheptimidazol-4-one ((S)-(-)-1). Also, the rat main metabolites were confirmed to be 8-hydroxylated compound (2) and 5-hydroxylated compound (3). These metabolites showed lower antagonistic activity than that of the parent compound.
20665528	Simultaneous determination of aripiprazole and its active metabolite, dehydroaripiprazole, in plasma by capillary electrophoresis combining on-column field-amplified sample injection and application in schizophrenia. A sensitive high-performance CZE combining on-column field-amplified sample injection (FASI) has been developed for simultaneous determination of aripiprazole and its active metabolite, dehydroaripiprazole, in human plasma. A sample pretreatment by means of liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) (diethyl ether) with subsequent quantitation by FASI-CZE was used. The separation of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole was performed using a BGE containing 150 mM phosphate buffer (pH 3.5) with 40% methanol and 0.02% PVA as a dynamic coating to reduce interaction of analytes with the capillary wall. Before sample loading, a methanol plug (0.3 psi, 6 s) was injected to permit FASI for stacking. The samples were injected electrokinetically (10 kV, 30 s) to introduce sample cations and the applied voltage was 20 kV with on-column detection at 214 nm. Several parameters affecting the separation and sensitivity of the drug and its active metabolite were studied, including reconstitution solvent, organic modifier, pH and concentration of phosphate buffer. The linear ranges of the method for test drug and its active metabolite, in plasma using amlodipine as an internal standard, were over the range 5.0-100.0 ng/mL. One female volunteer (25 years old) was orally administered a single dose of 10 mg aripiprazole (Abilify, Otsuka) and blood samples were drawn over a 60 h period for pharmacokinetic study. The method was also applied to monitor the concentration of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole in plasma collected after oral administration of 20 or 30 mg aripiprazole (Abilify, Otsuka) daily at steady state in one schizophrenic patient.
20444044	Grapefruit juice, lyophilized grapefruit juice, and powdered whole grapefruit inhibit cytochrome P450-mediated triazolam hydroxylation by beagle dog liver microsomes. Coadministration of grapefruit juice (GFJ) has been proposed to enhance the systemic availability and decrease the required dose of drugs such as cyclosporine that are extensively metabolized in the intestine and liver. Although GFJ inhibits human cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A, effects on dog CYP have not yet been reported. Consequently, we determined whether GFJ inhibits triazolam hydroxylation by Beagle dog liver microsomes (DLM) using human liver microsomes (HLM) as positive control. Results were compared with the effects of lyophilized GFJ and commercially-available powdered grapefruit capsules, which may be more convenient dosage forms. GFJ inhibited alpha-hydroxytriazolam formation in both DLM and HLM with similar IC(50) (inhibitor concentration producing a 50% decrease in reaction velocity) values of 0.56% and 0.52% (v/v), respectively. Lyophilized GFJ and powdered grapefruit also inhibited DLM alpha-hydroxytriazolam formation with IC(50) values of 0.76 and 1.2 mg/mL, respectively. Consistent with mechanism-based enzyme inhibition, preincubation of DLM with any of the grapefruit products for 20 min resulted in significant enhancement of inhibition of triazolam alpha-hydroxylation by 8-20%. The results indicate that 16 g of lyophilized GFJ or 23 g of powdered grapefruit would be equivalent to dosing 100 mL of GFJ. In vivo pharmacokinetic interaction studies are needed to confirm these in vitro findings.
18606399	Pharmacological effects of a novel isosorbide-based butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor. Isosorbide-2-benzylcarbamate-5-benzoate, a novel butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor, shows interspecies variation in its inhibitory activity (IC(50) of 4.3 nM for human plasma butyrylcholinesterase, but 1.09 microM for mouse plasma butyrylcholinesterase). Stability studies revealed that this drug is resistant to hydrolysis by human plasma (no degradation in 1 h). However, it was found to undergo rapid degradation when incubated with mouse plasma or mouse liver homogenate, yielding benzyl carbamate and benzoic acid. The addition of the carboxylesterase inhibitor bis-(4-nitrophenyl) phosphate (BNPP) inhibited the degradation of the novel drug, indicating that it may be a substrate for both butyrylcholinesterase and carboxylesterase. The absence of carboxylesterase from human plasma explains the drug's stability in this medium. In vivo, pharmacodynamic studies on single doses of 1 mg/kg to naïve male C57BL/6 mice revealed maximal plasma butyrylcholinesterase inhibition 20 min after intraperitoneal administration (approximately 60% inhibition) and 1 h after administration by gavage (approximately 45% inhibition). While this plasma butyrylcholinesterase inhibition was short-lived, the drug also penetrated the blood-brain barrier resulting in a slight (10-15%) but persistent (> or =72 h) reduction in brain butyrylcholinesterase activity.
17521300	Artemisinin antimalarials moderately affect cytochrome P450 enzyme activity in healthy subjects. The aim of this study was to investigate which principal human cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes are affected by artemisinin and to what degree the artemisinin derivatives differ with respect to their respective induction and inhibition capacity. Seventy-five healthy adults were randomized to receive therapeutic oral doses of artemisinin, dihydroartemisinin, arteether, artemether or artesunate for 5 days (days 1-5). A six-drug cocktail consisting of caffeine, coumarin, mephenytoin, metoprolol, chlorzoxazone and midazolam was administered orally on days -6, 1, 5 and 10 to assess the activities of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A, respectively. Four-hour plasma concentrations of parent drugs and corresponding metabolites and 7-hydroxycoumarin urine concentrations were quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The 1-hydroxymidazolam/midazolam 4-h plasma concentration ratio (CYP3A) was increased on day 5 by artemisinin [2.66-fold (98.75% CI: 2.10-3.36)], artemether [1.54 (1.14-2.09)] and dihydroartemisinin [1.25 (1.06-1.47)] compared with day -6. The S-4'-hydroxymephenytoin/S-mephenytoin ratio (CYP2C19) was increased on day 5 by artemisinin [1.69 (1.47-1.94)] and arteether [1.33 (1.15-1.55)] compared with day -6. The paraxanthine/caffeine ratio (CYP1A2) was decreased on day 1 after administration of artemisinin [0.27 (0.18-0.39)], arteether [0.70 (0.55-0.89)] and dihydroartemisinin [0.73 (0.59-0.90)] compared with day -6. The alpha-hydroxymetoprolol/metoprolol ratio (CYP2D6) was lower on day 1 compared with day -6 in the artemisinin [0.82 (0.70-0.96)] and dihydroartemisinin [0.83 (0.71-0.96)] groups, respectively. In the artemisinin-treated subjects this decrease was followed by a 1.34-fold (1.14-1.58) increase from day 1 to day 5. These results show that intake of artemisinin antimalarials affect the activities of several principal human drug metabolizing CYP450 enzymes. Even though not significant in all treatment groups, changes in the individual metrics were of the same direction for all the artemisinin drugs, suggesting a class effect that needs to be considered in the development of new artemisinin derivatives and combination treatments of malaria.
11977110	Systemic absorption of topical lidocaine in normal volunteers, patients with post-herpetic neuralgia, and patients with acute herpes zoster. Topical lidocaine has been recently marketed as a new treatment for post-herpetic neuralgia. The aim of our study was to characterize the absorption profile of and systemic exposure to lidocaine from patch and gel formulations in normal volunteers, patients with post-herpetic neuralgia, and patients with acute herpes zoster. The bioavailability of lidocaine from the patch formulation averaged 3%, and was similar after single and repeated doses. Systemic exposure to lidocaine and monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX), the primary active metabolite of lidocaine, after application of lidocaine gel or patches was minimal in normal volunteers, patients with post-herpetic neuralgia, and patients with acute herpes zoster. Considering the benefit versus risk of topical lidocaine, systemic absorption and toxicity of lidocaine seems not to be a significant risk.
22100559	High-performance liquid chromatographic determination of tiapride and its phase I metabolite in blood plasma using tandem UV photodiode-array and fluorescence detection. New bioanalytical SPE-HPLC-PDA-FL method for the determination of the neuroleptic drug tiapride and its N-desethyl metabolite was developed, validated and applied to xenobiochemical and pharmacokinetic studies in humans and animals. The sample preparation process involved solid-phase extraction of diluted plasma spiked with sulpiride (an internal standard) using SPE cartridges DSC-PH Supelco, USA. Chromatographic separation of the extracts was performed on a Discovery HS F5 250 mm × 4 mm (Supelco) column containing pentafluorophenylpropylsilyl silica gel. Mobile phase (acetonitrile-0.01 M phosphate buffer pH=3, flow rate 1 ml min(-1)) in the gradient mode was employed in the HPLC analysis. Tandem UV photodiode-array→fluorescence detection was used for the determination of the analytes. Low concentrations of tiapride and N-desethyl tiapride were determined using a more selective fluorescence detector (λ(exc.)/λ(emiss.)=232 nm/334 nm), high concentrations (500-6000 pmol ml(-1)) using a UV PDA detector at 212 nm with a linear response. Each HPLC run lasted 15 min. Lower limits of quantification (LLOQ) for tiapride (N-desethyl tiapride) were found to be 8.24 pmol ml(-1) (10.11 pmol ml(-1)). The recoveries of tiapride ranged from 89.3 to 94.3%, 81.7 to 86.8% for internal standard sulpiride and 90.9 to 91.8% for N-desethyl tiapride.
845795	Pharmacokinetics of beta-methyldigoxin in healthy humans II: Oral studies and bioavailability. The pharmacokinetics of orally administered aqueous 3H-beta-methyldigoxin solutions were studied at two dose levels, 0.3 and 0.6 mg, in healthy human subjects. The drug and its metabolites were specifically assayed in biological fluids and compared with results after intravenous doses to the same subjects. No significant dose dependency was observed. The apparent half-life of absorption was 16+/-6 min (SEM). Digoxin was the only metabolite observed in the plasma and comprised 28.6+/-3.7% of the dose in the urine. 3H-beta-Methyldigoxin, renally excreted unchanged, comprised 25.7+/-1.7% (SEM). Water-soluble metabolites in the urine comprised 9.0+/-1.8%. Fecal and urinary excretion accounted for 85% of the dose at 144 hr. The oral absorption of unchanged 3H-beta-methyldigoxin from solution was 59+/-6% by area under the curve methods and 60+/-4% by renal excretion. A total of 73% of the dose in the solution was absorbed as beta-methyldigoxin and digoxin. First-pass metabolism prior to absorption was largely prehepatic and assignable to GI degradation; 21.9+/-2.8% was degraded with 12.8+/-4.0% to digoxin and 9.1+/-4.0% to water-soluble metabolites. From 14 to 18% of the administered oral dose did not reach the systemic circulation. Analog computer fitting of plasma and urine levels of drug and digoxin was consistent with the first-pass premise with a delayed absorption of GI-generated digoxin and other metabolites. There were no significant differences between the oral absorption of a tablet formulation and the solution. Orally administered beta-methyldigoxin solution delivered 97% cardioactivity as itself and digoxin with respect to an equivalent amount of intravenously administered digoxin. This value contrasts to the 140% delivered by intravenously administered beta-methyldigoxin on the premise of pharmacodynamic equivalence of systemically appearing digoxin and beta-methyl-digoxin. Literature reports on the oral bioavailability of solutions and solid dosage forms of digoxin were critically reviewed, but no reliable comparison of the extent and reproducibility of oral absorption of cardioactive agents from administered digoxin or beta-methyldigoxin could be made from the widely variable digoxin studies with nonspecific assays.
21303923	Prediction of human drug clearance by multiple metabolic pathways: integration of hepatic and intestinal microsomal and cytosolic data. The current study assesses hepatic and intestinal glucuronidation, sulfation, and cytochrome P450 (P450) metabolism of raloxifene, quercetin, salbutamol, and troglitazone using different in vitro systems. The fraction metabolized by conjugation and P450 metabolism was estimated in liver and intestine, and the importance of multiple metabolic pathways on accuracy of clearance prediction was assessed. In vitro intrinsic sulfation clearance (CL(int, SULT)) was determined in human intestinal and hepatic cytosol and compared with hepatic and intestinal microsomal glucuronidation (CL(int, UGT)) and P450 clearance (CL(int, CYP)) expressed per gram of tissue. Hepatic and intestinal cytosolic scaling factors of 80.7 mg/g liver and 18 mg/g intestine were estimated from published data. Scaled CL(int, SULT) ranged between 0.7 and 11.4 ml · min(-1) · g(-1) liver and 0.1 and 3.3 ml · min(-1) · g(-1) intestine (salbutamol and quercetin were the extremes). Salbutamol was the only compound with a high extent of sulfation (51 and 28% of total CL(int) for liver and intestine, respectively) and also significant renal clearance (26-57% of observed plasma clearance). In contrast, the clearance of quercetin was largely accounted for by glucuronidation. Drugs metabolized by multiple pathways (raloxifene and troglitazone) demonstrated improved prediction of intravenous clearance using data from all hepatic pathways (44-86% of observed clearance) compared with predictions based only on the primary pathway (22-36%). The assumption of no intestinal first pass resulted in underprediction of oral clearance for raloxifene, troglitazone, and quercetin (3-22% of observed, respectively). Accounting for the intestinal contribution to oral clearance via estimated intestinal availability improved prediction accuracy for raloxifene and troglitazone (within 2.5-fold of observed). Current findings emphasize the importance of both hepatic and intestinal conjugation for in vitro-in vivo extrapolation of metabolic clearance.
15640381	Cytochrome P450 3A-mediated metabolism of buspirone in human liver microsomes. This study was carried out to determine the metabolic pathways of buspirone and cytochrome P450 (P450) isoform(s) responsible for buspirone metabolism in human liver microsomes (HLMs). Buspirone mainly underwent N-dealkylation to 1-pyrimidinylpiperazine (1-PP), N-oxidation on the piperazine ring to buspirone N-oxide (Bu N-oxide), and hydroxylation to 3'-hydroxybuspirone (3'-OH-Bu), 5-hydroxybuspirone (5-OH-Bu), and 6'-hydroxybuspirone (6'-OH-Bu) in HLMs. The apparent K(m) values for buspirone metabolite formation in pooled HLMs were 8.7 (1-PP), 34.0 (Bu N-oxide), 4.3 (3'-OH-Bu), 11.4/514 (5-OH-Bu), and 8.8 microM (6'-OH-Bu). CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole (1 microM) completely inhibited the formation of all major metabolites in HLMs (0-16% of control), whereas the chemical inhibitor selective to other P450 isoforms had little or no inhibitory effect. Recombinant CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP2D6 exhibited buspirone oxidation activities among nine P450 isoforms tested. The overall metabolism rate of 5 microM buspirone by CYP3A4 was 18-fold greater than that by CYP2D6 and 35-fold greater than that by CYP3A5. In a panel of HLMs from 16 donors, buspirone metabolism correlated well CYP3A activity (r2 = 0.85-0.96, rho < 0.0005), but not the activities of other P450 isoforms. The metabolism rates of buspirone in CYP2D6 poor-metabolizer genotype HLMs were comparable to those in pooled HLMs. Taken together, these data suggest that CYP3A, mostly likely CYP3A4, is primarily responsible for the metabolism of buspirone in HLMs.
12451292	Monitoring urinary excretion of cannabinoids by fluorescence-polarization immunoassay: a cannabinoid-to-creatinine ratio study. Drug testing in substance abuse treatment programs is focused on urine analysis of parent drugs and major metabolites. Huestis reported that serial monitoring of the major urinary cannabinoid metabolite (delta9-THC-COOH)-to-creatinine ratios in paired urine specimens (collected at least 24 hours apart) could differentiate new marijuana or hashish use from residual cannabinoid metabolite excretion in urine after previous drug use. Subjects with a history of chronic marijuana use were screened for cannabinoids in urine over several months by an enzyme immunoassay (EMIT) with a cut-off value of 50 ng/mL. Presumptive positive specimens were confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for delta9-THC-COOH with a cut-off value of 15 ng/mL. The objective of this study was to determine whether a semiquantitative cannabinoids immunoassay (corrected for creatinine concentration) could differentiate new marijuana use from residual cannabinoid excretion in chronic users of marijuana or hashish compared with GC-MS. The criterion for new marijuana use was a cannabinoid-to-creatinine ratio > or =0.5 (dividing the immunoassay quantitative result to creatinine ratio of specimen 2 by the specimen 1 ratio, specimen 3 by the specimen 2 ratio, etc.). Urine specimens were analyzed by fluorescence-polarization immunoassay (FPIA) on an Abbott TDxFLx analyzer after analysis by GC-MS. In 90 urine specimens (group A) with delta9-THC-COOH values determined by GC-MS, the mean delta9-THC-COOH concentration was 44.4 ng/mL (range, 16-100), and the mean FPIA total cannabinoids value was 91.7 ng/mL (range, 21-204 ng/mL) with a correlation coefficient of 0.993 (group A). In 111 specimens (group B), the mean delta9-THC-COOH concentration was 361 ng/mL (range, 101-960 ng/mL). The mean FPIA value was 657 ng/mL (range, 211-1,270 ng/mL), and the correlation coefficient of the B series was 0.975. Percent cross-reactivity for delta9-THC-COOH standards prepared in drug-free urine by FPIA was 82% at 25 ng/mL, 45% at 50 ng/mL, and 50% at 100 ng/mL. Overall, there was 89% agreement (132 of 148 specimens) between FPIA and GC-MS. In 16 of 148 specimens, however, the FPIA and GC-MS paired urine data did not agree. The sensitivity of the FPIA assay was 95.3%, and the specificity was 44.4%. The authors conclude that FPIA cannabinoid analysis should be further evaluated as an alternative to GC-MS quantitation to help distinguish new marijuana use from residual marijuana metabolite excretion in clinical drug treatment programs.
8857570	On the metabolism and the toxicological analysis of methylenedioxyphenylalkylamine designer drugs by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Designer drugs of the methylenedioxyphenylalkylamine type are increasingly abused. Studies on their metabolism in humans are necessary to develop a reliable gas chromatography--mass spectrometry (GC-MS) screening procedure. Such a method must allow their detection in urine for drug testing in clinical and forensic toxicology. Studies on racemic methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), methylenedioxymetamphetamine (MDMA), methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDE), benzodioxazolylbutanamine (BDB), and N-methylbenzodioxazolylbutanamine (MBDB) are presented. The metabolites were identified by GC-MS after enzymatic hydrolysis, isolation (pH 4.5 and 8-9), and derivatization (acetylation followed by methylation). The drugs undergo two overlapping metabolic pathways: O-dealkylation of the methylenedioxy group to dihydroxy derivatives followed by methylation of one of the hydroxy groups and successive degradation of the side chain to N-dealkyl and deaminooxo metabolites. MDA, MDMA, and MDE are subsequently metabolized to glycine conjugates of the corresponding 3,4-disubstituted benzoic acids. The hydroxy metabolites are excreted in a conjugated form. Based on these results, a GC-MS procedure was developed for simultaneous screening and identification of these designer drugs and/or their metabolites in urine after acid hydrolysis, isolation at pH 8-9, and acetylation. With use of mass chromatography with the most characteristic fragment ions m/z 58, 72, 86, 150, 162, 164, 176, and 178, the presence of the designer drugs was indicated and the peak underlying spectra could be identified by computerized comparison with reference spectra recorded during the presented studies. The procedure was suitable to detect an abuse of or an intoxication with the studied designer drugs (detection limit 5-50 ng/ml).
11471772	The influence of CYP2D6 polymorphism on the antiarrhythmic efficacy of propafenone in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation during 3 months propafenone prophylactic treatment. Propafenone (PPF) is an antiarrhythmic, Class Ic agent. Its metabolism is genetically controlled by a cytochrome P450 isoenzyme named CYP2D6, which shows polymorphism in human population. The aim of this paper was to determine the correlation between the antiarrhythmic efficacy of PPF and the oxidation phenotype. SUBJECTS AND MATERIAL: The study group consisted of 42 patients, aged 36 to 75 years, suffering from paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). The oxidation phenotype was described by the metabolic ratio (MR) of sparteine. The MR value separated the group of poor metabolizers (MR > 20) from the group of extensive metabolizers (MR < 20) with the subgroup of very extensive metabolizers (MR < 1). The study was conducted during a 3-month PPF therapy for the prophylaxis of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. PPF was given orally, 300-450 mg/day. The oxidation phenotype was checked prior to the administration of PPF. Serum concentration of PPF at 7, 11 days and the end of PPF therapy were determined. Statistical analysis of data was performed with the chi2 test and the Pearson's correlation methods. In the group of 42 patients, PPF therapy was 100% effective in poor metabolizers (PM). In extensive metabolizers (EM), 61% efficacy was observed with efficacy 0% in very extensive metabolizers (VEM). The correlation between oxidation phenotype and the ability to maintain sinus rhythm (SR) was statistically significant (r = 0.414, p < 0.05). The antiarrhythmic efficacy of propafenone depends on the oxidation phenotype; 100% efficacy occurred in the group of poor metabolizers whereas PPF, at the dose tested, was ineffective in very extensive metabolizers.
16497679	Unexpected cause of raised benzene absorption in coke oven by-product workers. Urinary biological monitoring for benzene (by measuring benzene metabolites) in coke oven by-product workers produced the unexpected result that 2 out of 10 employees had significantly raised urinary S-phenylmercapturic acid (S-PMA). However, simultaneous personal air sampling showed no excessive airborne exposure. Possible causes for this finding were investigated having excluded inhalation as the route of uptake. It was suspected that skin absorption via contaminated overalls was the possible mechanism and a standard frequency for overall change was introduced. Changing overalls after every four shifts reduced uptake levels to less than the equivalent of 1 ppm inhaled dose for all employees. Skin absorption of benzene in coke oven by-product workers from contaminated overalls can be significant and therefore overalls should be changed on a regular and frequent basis.
17505827	A phase I and pharmacokinetic study of sunitinib administered daily for 2 weeks, followed by a 1-week off period. Sunitinib, an oral multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits VEGFR, PDGFR, FLT3, KIT, and RET, is currently approved for the treatment of imatinib-refractory GIST and advanced renal cell carcinoma at a dose of 50 mg daily for 4 weeks followed by a 2-week off period (4/2 schedule). This trial was performed to investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of sunitinib 50 mg daily for 2 weeks followed by a 1-week off period (2/1 schedule). Twelve patients with advanced refractory malignancies were treated with sunitinib on the 2/1 schedule. Intensive safety monitoring included serial measurements of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Extensive pharmacokinetic sampling was performed on days 1 and 14 of course 1, and on day 14 of courses 2 and 3 to evaluate sunitinib and the SU12662 metabolite. Twelve patients received a total of 50 courses with an average (+/-SD) off-drug period of 11.5 +/- 5.7 days. Two patients experienced DLT: one patient had asymptomatic grade 4 elevations in lipase and amylase, and another patient had an asymptomatic grade 2 decline in LVEF in course 1. In total, five patients demonstrated asymptomatic grade 2 declines in LVEF. Other principal effects were similar to previous experience with sunitinib, including fatigue, myelosuppression, skin discoloration, and gastrointestinal effects. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed no significant accumulation of sunitinib or SU12662. One patient with papillary thyroid cancer developed a partial response, and was on study for 16 courses, followed by an additional 18 courses on a continuation protocol. The 2/1 schedule of sunitinib 50 mg was tolerable, and no significant drug accumulation was demonstrated. The safety profile on this schedule was consistent with the safety profile of sunitinib when administered on a 4-week on, 2-week off schedule.
16611861	Identification of human hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of 8-prenylnaringenin and isoxanthohumol from hops (Humulus lupulus L.). The female flowers of hops (Humulus lupulus L.) are used in the brewing of beer and are under investigation for use in dietary supplements for the management of menopausal symptoms in women. Hop extracts contain the weakly estrogenic compound isoxanthohumol (IX), proestrogenic xanthohumol, and the potent estrogen 8-prenylnaringenin (8PN). Because IX can be metabolized in the human liver to form 8PN, the specific cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes responsible for this O-demethylation reaction were identified. In addition, the enzymes that convert IX and 8PN to their most abundant metabolites were identified because these metabolic pathways might also affect the estrogenicity of hop preparations. Specifically, the P450 enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of the prenyl side chains of IX and 8PN into trans- or cis-alcohols were investigated. Human liver microsomes and monoclonal antibodies that inhibit specific P450 enzymes were used in combination with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry to identify the enzymes responsible for these transformations. CYP2C19 was found to catalyze the formation of both cis- and trans-alcohols of the prenyl side chain of 8PN with K(m) values of 14.8 +/- 3.2 and 16.6 +/- 4.6 microM, respectively. CYP2C8 converted 8PN regioselectively to the trans-alcohol of the prenyl group with a K(m) of 3.7 +/- 0.9 microM. Finally, CYP1A2 was found to catalyze the O-demethylation of IX to generate 8PN, with a K(m) value of 17.8 +/- 3.7 microM. These results suggest that the estrogenicity of hop constituents in vivo will depend in part on metabolic conversion that may show individual variation.
19666078	CYP1-mediated antiproliferative activity of dietary flavonoids in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells. Among the different mechanisms proposed to explain the cancer-protecting effect of dietary flavonoids, substrate-like interactions with cytochrome P450 CYP1 enzymes have recently been explored. In the present study, the metabolism of the flavonoids chrysin, baicalein, scutellarein, sinensetin and genkwanin by recombinant CYP1A1, CYP1B1 and CYP1A2 enzymes, as well as their antiproliferative activity in MDA-MB-468 human breast adenocarcinoma and MCF-10A normal breast cell lines, were investigated. Baicalein and 6-hydroxyluteolin were the only conversion products of chrysin and scutellarein metabolism by CYP1 family enzymes, respectively, while baicalein itself was not metabolized further. Sinensetin and genkwanin produced a greater number of metabolites and were shown to inhibit strongly in vitro proliferation of MDA-MB-468 cells at submicromolar and micromolar concentrations, respectively, without essentially affecting the viability of MCF-10A cells. Cotreatment of the CYP1 family inhibitor acacetin reversed the antiproliferative activity noticed for the two flavones in MDA-MB-468 cells to 13 and 14 microM respectively. In contrast chrysin, baicalein and scutellarein inhibited proliferation of MDA-MB-468 cells to a lesser extent than sinensetin and genkwanin. The metabolism of genkwanin to apigenin and of chrysin to baicalein was favored by CYP1B1 and CYP1A1, respectively. Taken together the data suggests that CYP1 family enzymes enhance the antiproliferative activity of dietary flavonoids in breast cancer cells, through bioconversion to more active products.
2291877	The influence of food on the pharmacokinetics of CGP 6140 (amocarzine) after oral administration of a 1200 mg single dose to patients with onchocerciasis. Eleven male patients from Mali with Onchocerca volvulus infections received in random order a 1200 mg single oral dose of CGP 6140 after an overnight fast and after food intake. The concentrations of CGP 6140 and of its N-oxide metabolite, CGP 13231, were measured in plasma and urine. Mean (+/- s.d.) AUC CGP 6140 values were 67.0 +/- 10.8 mumol l-1 h in fed and 22.0 +/- 17.2 mumol l-1 h in fasting patients. The mean maximum concentrations (Cmax) in plasma +/- s.d. were 12.7 +/- 2.8 mumol l-1 in fed and 4.7 +/- 4.1 mumol l-1 in fasting patients. The median time to Cmax was 3 h in fed and 2 h in fasting patients. Mean (+/- s.d.) AUC of the N-oxide metabolite was 59.9 +/- 10.7 mumol l-1 h in fed and 23.4 +/- 16.2 mumol l-1 h in fasting patients. The urinary recovery was less than 0.5% of dose for CGP 6140 in both fed and fasting conditions. It was 30.1 +/- 11.5 and 11.4 +/- 8.0% of the dose for the N-oxide metabolite in fed and fasting conditions, respectively. Variability in plasma concentrations and urinary recovery of CGP 6140 and of the N-oxide metabolite was greater in fasted patients. The low solubility of CGP 6140 in aqueous solutions at neutral pH and its higher solubility at acidic pH might explain the increase in bioavailability after food intake. The administration of CGP 6140 after food intake is therefore recommended for an optimal systemic effect.
690998	Metabolic fate of tolazamide in man and in the rat. The metabolic fate of tolazamide, 1-(hexahydroazepin-1-yl)-3-p-tolylsulfonylurea (1), was studied in man and in the rat using tritium-labeled 1. The metabolites were isolated in crystalline form from urine for structure determination. The crystal structure and final molecular structure of one of these, 1-(4-hydroxyhexahydroazepin-1-yl)-3-p-tolylsulfonylurea (5), were determined using single-crystal X-ray techniques. Following oral administration of tritiated tolazamide to male humans, 85% of the radioactivity was excreted in urine during a 5-day period. In addition to being excreted in urine unchanged, tolazamide was metabolized to 1-(hexahydroazepin-1-yl)-3-p-(carboxyphenyl)sulfonylurea (2), p-toluenesulfonamide (3), 1-(hexahydroazepin-1-yl)-3-p-(hydroxymethylphenyl)sulfonylurea (4), 1-(4-hydroxyhexahydroazepin-1-yl)-3-p-tolylsulfonylurea (5) and a labile, unidentified metabolite 6 by man. The relative amounts of these materials excreted in 0-24-h urine collections from eight subjects averaged 7, 17, 26, 10, 25, and 15% for 1-6, respectively. In the female rat, 79% of an orally administered dose of tritiated tolazamide was excreted in urine during a 5-day period as 1-4. The relative amounts of these materials excreted during the 24-h period following administration of tolazamide were 10, 5, 5, and 80% for 1-4, respectively.
11453890	In vitro metabolism and drug interaction potential of a new highly potent anti-cytomegalovirus molecule, CMV423 (2-chloro 3-pyridine 3-yl 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroindolizine I-carboxamide). To identify the enzymes involved in the metabolism of CMV423, a new anticytomegalovirus molecule, to evaluate its in vitro clearance and to investigate its potential involvement in drug/drug interactions that might occur in the clinic. The enzymes involved in and the kinetics of CMV423 biotransformation were determined using pools of human liver subcellular fractions and heterologously expressed human cytochromes P450 (CYP) and FMO. The effect of CMV423 on CYP probe activities as well as on indinavir and AZT metabolism was determined, and 26 drugs were tested for their potential to inhibit or activate CMV423 metabolism. CMV423 was oxidized by CYP and not by FMO or cytosolic enzymes. The Km values for 8-hydroxylation to rac-RPR 127025, an active metabolite, and subsequent ketone formation by human liver microsomes were 44 +/- 13 microM and 47 +/- 11 microM, respectively, with corresponding Vmax/Km ratios of 14 and 4 microl min(-1) nmol(-1) P450. Inhibition with selective CYP inhibitors indicated that CYP1A2 was the main isoform involved, with some participation from CYP3A. Expressed human CYP1A1, 1A2, 2C9, 3A4 and 2C8 catalysed rac-RPR 127025 formation with Km values of < 10 microM, 50 +/- 21 microM, 55 +/- 19 microM, circa 282 +/- 61 microM and circa 1450 microM, respectively. CYP1B1, 2A6, 2B6, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 or 3A5 did not catalyse the reaction to any detectable extent. CYP1A1 and 3A4 also catalysed ketone formation from rac-RPR 127025. In human liver microsomes, CMV423 at 1 and 10 microM inhibited CYP1A2 activity up to 31% and 63%, respectively, CYP3A4 activity up to 40% (10 microM) and CYP2C9 activity by 35% (1 and 10 microM). No effect was observed on CYP2A6, 2D6 and 2E1 activities. CMV423 had no effect on indinavir and AZT metabolism. Amongst 26 drugs tested, none inhibited CMV423 metabolism in vitro at therapeutic concentrations. CMV423 is mainly metabolized by CYP1A2 and 3A4. Its metabolism should not be saturable at the targeted therapeutic concentrations range (Cmax < 1 microM). CMV423 will probably affect CYP1A2 and 1A1 activities in vivo to some extent, but no other drug-drug interactions are expected.
17576805	Characterization of diuron N-demethylation by mammalian hepatic microsomes and cDNA-expressed human cytochrome P450 enzymes. Diuron, a widely used herbicide and antifouling biocide, has been shown to persist in the environment and contaminate drinking water. It has been characterized as a "known/likely" human carcinogen. Whereas its environmental transformation and toxicity have been extensively examined, its metabolic characteristics in mammalian livers have not been reported. This study was designed to investigate diuron biotransformation and disposition because metabolic routes, metabolizing enzymes, interactions, interspecies differences, and interindividual variability are important for risk assessment purposes. The only metabolic pathway detected by liquid chromatography/mass spectometry in human liver homogenates and seven types of mammalian liver microsomes including human was demethylation at the terminal nitrogen atom. No other phase I or phase II metabolites were observed. The rank order of N-demethyldiuron formation in liver microsomes based on intrinsic clearance (V(max)/K(m)) was dog > monkey > rabbit > mouse > human > minipig > rat. All tested recombinant human cytochrome P450s (P450s) catalyzed diuron N-demethylation and the highest activities were possessed by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. Relative contributions of human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 to hepatic diuron N-demethylation, based on average abundances of P450 enzymes in human liver microsomes, were approximately 60, 14, and 13%, respectively. Diuron inhibited relatively potently only CYP1A1/2 (IC(50) 4 microM). With human-derived and quantitative chemical-specific data, the uncertainty factors for animal to human differences and for human variability in toxicokinetics were within the range of the toxicokinetics default uncertainty/safety factors for chemical risk assessment.
16131524	Unusual dehydroxylation of antimicrobial amidoxime prodrugs by cytochrome b5 and NADH cytochrome b5 reductase. Furamidine is an effective antimicrobial agent; however, oral potency of furamidine is poor. A prodrug of furamidine, 2,5-bis(4-amidinophenyl)furan-bis-O-methylamidoxime (DB289), has greatly improved oral potency. DB289 is transformed to furamidine via O-demethylation, and N-dehydroxylation reactions with four intermediate metabolites formed. The O-demethylation reactions have been shown to be catalyzed by cytochrome P450. The enzymes catalyzing the reductive N-dehydroxylation reactions have not been determined. The objective of this study was to identify the enzymes that catalyze N-dehydroxylation of metabolites M1, a monoamidoxime, and M2, a diamidoxime, formed during generation of furamidine. M1 and M2 metabolism was investigated using human liver microsomes and human soluble cytochrome b5 and NAD cytochrome b5 reductase, expressed in Escherichia coli. Kinetics of M1 and M2 reduction by human liver microsomes exhibited high affinity and moderate capacity. Metabolism was significantly inhibited by antibodies to cytochrome b5 and b5 reductase and by chemical inhibitors of b5 reductase. The amidoximes were efficiently metabolized by liver mitochondria, which contain cytochrome b5/b5 reductase, but not by liver cytosol, which contains minimal amounts of these proteins. Expressed cytochrome b5/b5 reductase, in the absence of any other proteins, efficiently catalyzed reduction of both amidoximes. K(m) values were similar to those for microsomes, and V(max) values were 33- to 36-fold higher in the recombinant system compared with microsomes. Minimal activity was seen with cytochrome b5 or b5 reductase alone or with cytochrome P450 reductase alone or with cytochrome b5. These results indicate that cytochrome b5 and b5 reductase play a direct role in metabolic activation of DB289 to furamidine.
2872296	Metabolism of cathinone to (-)-norephedrine and (-)-norpseudoephedrine. S-(-)-Cathinone (S-(-)-alpha-aminopropiophenone) is the major active principle of khat leaves (Catha edulis), which are widely used in East Africa and the Arab peninsula as an amphetamine-like stimulant. After oral administration of synthesized cathinone (isomers, racemate), 22-52% was recovered in 24 h urine samples mainly as aminoalcohol metabolites. With GC/MS, HPLC and CD, the main metabolite of S-(-)-cathinone was identified as R/S-(-)-norephedrine and the main metabolite of R-(+)-cathinone as R/R-(-)-norpseudoephedrine. Both aminoalcohols are formed by a stereospecific keto reduction.
12394264	An excretion balance and pharmacokinetic study of the novel anticancer agent E7070 in cancer patients. E7070 is a novel sulfonamide anticancer agent that arrests the G /S phase of the cell cycle. Preclinical and phase I studies have demonstrated non-linear pharmacokinetics of the drug. The objective of this study was to quantify the excretion of E7070 and the metabolite 1,4-benzene-sulfonamide (M1) in cancer patients. E7070 (1,000 mg) radiolabeled by (14)C in the benzene disulfonamide moiety (cohort 1, n = 6) or in the indole moiety (cohort 2, n = 7) was i.v. infused over 1 h. The levels of radioactivity in plasma, red blood cells, urine and feces were determined by liquid scintillation counting, and the E7070 and M1 concentrations in plasma, urine and feces were determined by coupled liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS). In plasma, the mean area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) based on radio-activity measurements (32.5 and 28.9 h. mM in cohorts 1 and 2, respectively) was substantially higher than the mean AUC of E7070 (3.8 h x mmol/l) and M1 (0.1 h x mmol/l) in all patients. The excretion of radioactivity (mean +/- SD) as a percentage of administered radioactivity was higher in urine [63.7 +/- 9.8% (cohort 1) and 61.5 +/- 5.5% (cohort 2)] than in feces [22.7 +/- 2.6% (1) and 21.1 +/- 3.1% (2)] during a mean collection period of 11 days. In both cohorts, the contribution of urinary and fecal recovery of E7070 (2.3 and 2.7%, respectively) and M1 (5.3 and 5.1%, respectively) was low. Subsequent HPLC analysis with online radioisotope detection of urine showed that the high radioactivity levels are caused by compounds other than E7070 and M1. The major metabolite is formed by glucuronidation of a hydroxylated metabolite of E7070. In conclusion, the excretion of the benzene sulfonamide and the indole moieties of E7070 was the same with a higher renal than gastrointestinal excretion. E7070 is extensively converted into currently unidentified metabolites. Glucuronidation is a major metabolic pathway.
15601807	Examination of 209 drugs for inhibition of cytochrome P450 2C8. Cytochrome P450 2C8 is involved in the metabolism of drugs such as paclitaxel, repaglinide, rosiglitazone, and cerivastatin, among others. An in vitro assessment of 209 frequently prescribed drugs and related xenobiotics was carried out to examine their potential to inhibit CYP2C8. A validated sensitive, moderate-throughput high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS/MS) assay was used to detect N-desethylamodiaquine, the CYP2C8-derived major metabolite of amodiaquine metabolism, using heterologously expressed recombinant CYP2C8 (rhCYP2C8) and pooled human liver microsomes. The 209 drugs were first tested at 30 muM for their ability to inhibit rhCYP2C8. Forty-eight compounds exhibited greater than 50% inhibition and were further evaluated for measurement of IC50. The six most potent inhibitors (IC50 <1 microM) from this set were measured for IC50 in pooled human liver microsomes, and the most potent inhibitor identified was the leukotriene receptor antagonist, montelukast (IC50 = 19.6 nM). Inhibitors of CYP2C8 were identified from a wide variety of therapeutic classes, with no single class predominating. Other potent inhibitors included candesartan cilexetil (cyclohexylcarbonate ester prodrug of candesartan), zafirlukast, clotrimazole, felodipine, and mometasone furoate. Seventeen moderate inhibitors of rhCYP2C8 (1 < IC50 < 10 microM) included salmeterol, raloxifene, fenofibrate, ritonavir, levothyroxine, tamoxifen, loratadine, quercetin, oxybutynin, medroxyprogesterone, simvastatin, ketoconazole, ethinyl estradiol, spironolactone, lovastatin, nifedipine, and irbesartan. These in vitro data were used along with clinical pharmacokinetic information in predicting potential drug-drug interactions that could occur by inhibition of CYP2C8. Although almost all drugs tested are not expected to cause drug interactions via inhibition of CYP2C8, montelukast was identified as being of concern as a potential inhibitor of clinical relevance. These findings are discussed in context to potential drug interactions that could be observed between these agents and drugs for which CYP2C8 is involved in metabolism and warrant investigation of the possibility of clinical drug interactions mediated by inhibition of this enzyme.
16717432	Biotransformation of (-)-menthone by human liver microsomes. The aim of the current study was to investigate the metabolism of (-)-menthone by liver microsomes of humans. (-)-Menthone (1) was metabolized to (+)-neomenthol (2) (3-reduction) and 7-hydroxymenthone (3) by human liver microsomes. The metabolites formed were analyzed on GC and GC-MS. Kinetic analysis showed that K(m) and V(max) values for the metabolized (-)-menthone to respective (+)-neomenthol and 7-hydroxymenthone by liver microsomes of human sample HG70 were 0.37 mM and 4.91 nmol/min/mg protein and 0.07 mM and 0.71 nmol/min/mg protein.
17064080	Synthesis and pharmacokinetics of valopicitabine (NM283), an efficient prodrug of the potent anti-HCV agent 2'-C-methylcytidine. In our search for new therapeutic agents against chronic hepatitis C, a ribonucleoside analogue, 2'-C-methylcytidine, was discovered to be a potent and selective inhibitor in cell culture of a number of RNA viruses, including the pestivirus bovine viral diarrhea virus, a surrogate model for hepatitis C virus (HCV), and three flaviviruses, namely, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, and dengue-2 virus. However, pharmacokinetic studies revealed that 2'-C-methylcytidine suffers from a low oral bioavailability. To overcome this limitation, we have synthesized the 3'-O-l-valinyl ester derivative (dihydrochloride form, valopicitabine, NM283) of 2'-C-methylcytidine. We detail herein for the first time the chemical synthesis and physicochemical characteristics of this anti-HCV prodrug candidate, as well as a comparative study of its pharmacokinetic parameters with those of its parent nucleoside analogue, 2'-C-methylcytidine.
16684711	Aldehyde oxidase and its contribution to the metabolism of a structurally novel, functionally selective GABAA alpha5-subtype inverse agonist. (3-Tert-butyl-7-(5-methylisoxazol-3-yl)-2-(1-methyl-1H-1,2,4-triazol-5-ylmethoxy)pyrazolo[1,5-d] [1,2,4]triazine was recently identified as a functionally selective, inverse agonist at the benzodiazepine site of GABA(A) alpha5-containing receptors, which enhances performance in animal models of cognition. The routes of metabolism of this compound in rat, dog, rhesus monkey and human in vitro systems, and in vivo in rat, dog and rhesus monkey have been characterized. The current study demonstrates that both a cytosolic oxidative reaction and cytochrome P450 play important roles in the metabolism of the compound. Chemical inhibition studies showed the oxidation in human cytosol to be catalysed predominantly by aldehyde oxidase rather than the related enzyme, xanthine oxidase. The aldehyde oxidase-mediated metabolites were present in vitro and in vivo in both rat and rhesus monkey, and also in vitro in man. They were absent both in vitro and in vivo in dog.
18393453	Bioactivation of a dihydropyrazole-1-carboxylic acid-(4-chlorophenyl amide) scaffold to a putative p-chlorophenyl isocyanate in rat liver microsomes and in vivo in rats. Compound I (4,5-dihydropyrazole-1,5-dicarboxylic acid-1-[(4-chlorophenyl)-amide] 5-[(2-oxo-2 H-[1,3']bipyridinyl-6'-yl)-amide] was found to undergo metabolic activation in rat liver microsomes in the presence of NADPH. A reactive intermediate, postulated to be p-chlorophenyl isocyanate (CPIC), was trapped by GSH in vitro and characterized by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Subsequently, the structure of the GSH conjugate was confirmed by a comparison with a synthetic standard. The GSH conjugate was also found in the bile of rats that received an oral dose (10 mg/kg) of compound I. Further analyses of rat bile and urine using online electrochemical derivatization coupled to LC/MS demonstrated the presence of p-chlorophenyl aniline (CPA), a hydrolytic product of the intermediate isocyanate. This provided further evidence for the potential existence of CPIC. Approximately 7% of the dose was accounted by the products of CPIC, which included the GSH conjugate and CPA excreted in bile and urine. Multiple rat cytochrome P450 enzymes, including P450 1A, P450 2C, and P450 3A, appeared to be responsible for the activation of compound I to CPIC. The activation kinetics of compound I to CPIC in male rat liver microsomes exhibited a biphasic profile, indicative of at least two contributing P450 enzymes. One enzyme showed a small value of K m at 42 microM and a low V max of 66 pmol min (-1) mg (-1), while the other exhibited a large value of K m at 148 microM and a high V max of 1200 pmol min (-1) mg (-1). The formation of a putative CPIC intermediate, a carbamoylating species known to be capable of covalent binding to macromolecules, suggests a potential liability associated with the compound, particularly the dihydropyrazole-1-carboxylic acid-(4-chlorophenyl amide) scaffold, which appears to be responsible for the generation of CPIC. The mechanism of bioactivation to the putative CPIC is postulated to involve an initial P450-mediated hydroxylation of the pyrazoline at the 3 position followed by subsequent decomposition to CPIC. This mechanistic insight into the bioactivation allowed for the development of a rational structural modification strategy to mitigate or minimize the reactive metabolite formation. One of the approaches included the introduction of a metabolically stable substituent with electron-donating character at the 3 position of pyrazoline to block CPIC formation.
22264564	An HPLC-ESI-MS method for simultaneous determination of fourteen metabolites of promethazine and caffeine and its application to pharmacokinetic study of the combination therapy against motion sickness. The combination therapy, promethazine and caffeine had been proven effective in treating motion sickness and counteracting some possible side effects of using promethazine alone while the mechanism and interaction remained unclear. Therefore, an HPLC-ESI-MS method for simultaneous determination of both drugs, and their metabolites was developed for purpose of pharmacokinetic study. To determine as many metabolites as possible, the influence of parameters such as column, flow rate and pH value of mobile phase, ionization polarity and fragmentation voltage were optimized. Fourteen target analytes were well separated and all of them could be identified and determined in plasma after administration of promethazine and caffeine. The LODs and LOQs were 0.9-6.0 and 2.50-16.0 ng/ml, respectively; the recoveries of three levels of quality control samples were from 86.7% to 102%; the intra-day and inter-day precisions were less than 3% and 9%, separately; and the RSDs of compound stability were all lower than 10% within 24h after sample preparation. As a pharmacokinetic study of the combination therapy in 30 healthy volunteers, concentration-time curves of the drugs and metabolites were studied. The present method for simultaneous measurement of more than ten metabolites is valuable for the study of mechanism and interaction of the combination therapy.
17163483	Metabolism of chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos oxon by human hepatocytes. The metabolism of chlorpyrifos (CPS) and chlorpyrifos oxon (CPO) by human hepatocytes and human liver S9 fractions was investigated using LC-MS/MS. Cytochrome P450 (CYP)-dependent and phase II-related products were determined following incubation with CPS and CPO. CYP-related products, 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP), diethyl thiophosphate, and dealkylated CPS, were found following CPS treatment and dealkylated CPO following CPO treatment. Diethyl phosphate was not identified because of its high polarity and lack of retention with the chromatographic conditions employed. Phase II-related conjugates, including O- and S-glucuronides as well as 11 GSH-derived metabolites, were identified in CPS-treated human hepatocytes, although the O-sulfate of TCP conjugate was found only when human liver S9 fractions were used as the enzyme source. O-Glucuronide of TCP was also identified in CPO-treated hepatocytes. CPS and CPO were identified using HPLC-UV after CPS metabolism by the human liver S9 fraction. However, CPO was not found following treatment of human hepatocytes with either CPS or CPO. These results suggest that human liver plays an important role in detoxification, rather than activation, of CPS.
21903155	Application of headspace solid phase dynamic extraction gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (HS-SPDE-GC/MS) for biomonitoring of n-heptane and its metabolites in blood. Solid phase dynamic extraction (SPDE) is an innovative sample preparation and enrichment technique in connection with gas chromatography (GC). Using SPDE, we developed a method for simultaneous determination of n-heptane and its mono-oxygenated metabolites heptane-4-one, 3-one, 2-one, 4-ol, 3-ol, 2-ol, and 1-ol in blood. After adjustment of various extraction and desorption parameters, method validation resulted in limits of detection (LOD) between 0.006 (heptane-4-one) and 0.021mg/L (heptane-1-ol). Intra-assay coefficients of variation ranged between 4.8% and 20.8% while relative recovery ranged between 100% and 117% (spiked concentration 0.128mg/L, n=8). The method was applied to blood samples, which have been collected from 20 volunteers after controlled inhalative exposure to 167, 333, and 500ppm n-heptane. After 3h of exposure, n-heptane and heptane-2-one were detectable in all samples in concentrations ranging up to 2.903 and 0.495mg/L, while the concentrations of the remaining analytes were closer to the respective LOD or even below. A significant linear relationship with ambient exposure (R(2)=0.701, p<0.001, n=55) was found for n-heptane in blood, which could be helpful for evaluation of biological exposure limits in future. Due to its high abundance in blood, 2-heptanone could be an interesting candidate as a biomarker also in alternative matrices such as urine or saliva.
11204222	Simple and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the determination of 1,5-benzodiazepine clobazam and its active metabolite N-desmethylclobazam in human serum and urine with application to 1,4-benzodiazepines analysis. A HPLC-UV determination of clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam in human serum and urine is presented. After simple liquid-liquid extraction with dichloromethane the compounds and an internal standard diazepam were separated on a Supelcosil LC-8-DB column at ambient temperature under isocratic conditions using the mobile phase: CH3CN-water-0.5 M KH2PO4-H3PO4 (440:540:20:0.4, v/v and 360:580:60:0.4, v/v for serum and urine, respectively). The detection was performed at 228 nm with limits of quantification of 2 ng/ml for serum and 1 ng/ml for urine. Relative standard deviations for intra- and inter-assay precision were found below 8% for both compounds for all the tested concentrations. The described procedure may be easily adapted for several 1,4-benzodiazepines.
20352613	Identification of ilaprazole metabolites in human urine by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS and HPLC-NMR experiments. Ilaprazole is a new proton pump inhibitor designed for the treatment of gastric ulcers, and limited data is available on the metabolism of the drug. In this article, the structural elucidation of urinary metabolites of ilaprazole in human was described by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS and stopped-flow HPLC-NMR experiments. Urinary samples were precipitated by sodium carbonate solution, and then extracted by liquid-liquid extraction after adding ammonium acetate buffer solution. The enriched sample was separated using a C(18) reversed-phase column with the mobile phase composed of acetonitrile and 0.05 mol/L ammonium acetate buffer solution in a gradient solution, and then directly coupled to ESI-MS/MS detection in an on-line mode or (1)H-NMR (500 MHz) spectroscopic detection in a stopped-flow mode. As a result, four sulfide metabolites, ilaprazole sulfide (M1), 12-hydroxy-ilaprazole sulfide (M2), 11,12-dihydroxy-ilaprazole sulfide (M3) and ilaprazole sulfide A (M4), were identified by comparing their MS/MS and NMR data with those of the parent drug and available standard compounds. The main biotransformation reactions of ilaprazole were reduction and the aromatic hydroxylation of the parent drug and its relative metabolites. The result testified that HPLC-ESI-MS/MS and HPLC-NMR could be widely applied in detection and identification of novel metabolites.
17701832	The metabolism of the 5HT3 antagonists ondansetron, alosetron and GR87442 I: a comparison of in vitro and in vivo metabolism and in vitro enzyme kinetics in rat, dog and human hepatocytes, microsomes and recombinant human enzymes. The metabolism of the structurally related 5HT3 antagonists ondansetron, alosetron and GR87442 in the rat, dog and human was determined in hepatocytes, liver microsomes and human recombinant microsomes. The profiles of phase I metabolites were similar in human hepatocytes and microsomes. The metabolites of all three compounds produced in rat, dog and human microsomes and hepatocytes were similar to those seen in vivo, with the major routes of metabolism being N-dealkylation and/or hydroxylation. There was more extensive metabolic processing in hepatocytes than in microsomes; however, sequential metabolism was less extensive in vitro compared with in vivo. The pharmacokinetics of the three 5HT3 antagonists investigated were dominated by CYP3A4 (and/or 2C9) compared with CYP1A2 in man, possibly determined by enzyme capacity rather than relative enzyme affinity. These data support the use of rat, dog and human hepatocytes for the prediction of in vivo metabolites of ondansetron, alosetron and GR87442.
19053182	In vitro nimesulide studies toward understanding idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity: diiminoquinone formation and conjugation. Nimesulide is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) marketed in more than 50 countries. This drug has caused rare and idiosyncratic but severe hepatotoxicity. The mechanisms associated with and factors responsible for this toxicity remain unknown. One of the nimesulide metabolites identified in human urine is 4-amino-2-phenoxy-methanesulfonanilide (M1). In the current study, we demonstrate that M1 is a stable metabolite that is highly susceptible to facile oxidation by cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s) to form a reactive diiminoquinone intermediate (M2). Direct detection of M2 was difficult by LC-MS. However, its formation was confirmed indirectly by identification of N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) adducts of M2. The formation of diiminoquinone M2 was P450 mediated with 2C19 and 1A2 as the two principal P450 enzymes catalyzing M1 oxidation. M1 metabolism irreversibly inhibited 2C19 but activated 1A2 in a time-dependent manner. P450 2C19 exclusively mediated further metabolism of M1 to the amino hydroxynimesulide M3 and its diiminoquinone M4. Similar to M2, M4 is also reactive and can be observed indirectly as its NAC adduct. Nucleophilic addition to diiminoquinone M2 occurs with low regioselectivity, yielding three adducts (the peak area ratio 1:0.08:12). The three regioisomers have the same m/z for [M + H](+), presumably due to nucleophilic addition at the three possible electrophilic sites (C-3, -5, and -6 positions of the sulfonaniline ring). The primary adduct, R, was derived from the attack of the nucleophile at the C-5 position of the sulfonaniline ring and was determined by MS/MS and (1)H and (13)C NMR analyses. The structural assignments were confirmed by chemical synthesis of the adduct R. M2 demonstrated its electrophilic reactivity by selectively alkylating human serum albumin (HSA) at the only free thiol, Cys-34. This suggests the possibility that other proteins may undergo a similar conjugation to form irreversible adducts. Under oxidizing conditions in the presence of cumene hydroperoxide (CHP), the formation of M2 was enhanced, indicating that oxidative stress may accelerate the production of reactive diiminoquinone species (M2 and M4).
8055632	Glucuronidation of carcinogenic arylamines and their N-hydroxy derivatives by rat and human phenol UDP-glucuronosyltransferase of the UGT1 gene complex. Since carcinogenic arylamines are sequentially oxidized and conjugated with glucuronic acid, differences in glucuronidation may critically determine the toxic potential of these compounds. Therefore, N-glucuronidation of 1- and 2-naphthylamine (1-NA and 2-NA),4-aminobiphenyl(4-ABP) and their N-hydroxy derivatives was investigated using rat and human liver microsomes and V79 cell-expressed phenol UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) of the UGT1 gene complex. Cell-expressed UGTs included rat and human UGT1.6, which are known to conjugate planar phenols, and human UGT1.7, conjugating both planar and bulky phenol. (i) N-Glucuronidation of 1- and 2-NA and of N-hydroxy-2-NA was inducible by 3-methylcholanthrene in rat liver microsomes whereas N-glucuronidation of the bulky arylamines 4-ABP and N-hydroxy-4-ABP was not. In support of these findings mutagenicity of N-hydroxy-2-NA in the Ames test was markedly reduced upon addition of UDP-glucuronic acid using liver homogenates from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats. (ii) With cell-expressed rat UGT1.6, non-carcinogenic 1-NA was conjugated with the highest rate and with higher affinity than 2-NA. UGT1.6 showed poor activity towards N-hydroxy-4-ABP and 4-ABP. (iii) Substrate specificity of human UGT1.6 also appeared to be limited to planar 1-NA, 2-NA and its N-hydroxy derivative, whereas UGT1.7 showed broader substrate specificity, including the bulky arylamine 4-ABP and its N-hydroxy derivative. The results suggest marked differences in substrate specificity of different UGT isozymes for arylamines and their N-hyroxy derivatives.
18191932	Simultaneous determination of GFA and its active metabolites in human plasma by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and its application to pharmacokinetic studies. A sensitive and rapid liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) method has been developed and validated for simultaneous quantification of guanfu base A (GFA) and its metabolites guanfu base I (GFI) and guanfu alcohol-amine (AA) in human plasma with phenoprolamine hydrochloride (DDPH) as the internal standard. The analytes were extracted from human plasma by using liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate and the LC separation was performed on a Diamonsil C(18) analytical column (150 mm x 2.1 mm i.d., 5 microm). The MS acquisition was performed in selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode of positive ions. Analysis was carried out in SIM mode at m/z 430.25 for GFA [M+H](+), m/z 388.25 for GFI [M+H](+), m/z 346.25 for AA [M+H](+) and m/z 344.20 for the IS DDPH [M+H](+). The calibration curves were linear over the range of 50-5000 ng/mL for GFA and 5-1000 ng/mL for GFI and AA, with coefficients of correlation above 0.999. The lower limit of quantification for GFA was 1 ng/mL, while for GFI and AA were both 5 ng/mL. The intra- and inter-day precisions (CV) of analysis were within 9%, and the accuracy ranged from 91% to 108%. The overall recoveries for GFA, GFI and AA were about 94.2%, 87.8% and 80.6%, respectively. The total LC-MS run-time was only 5.5 min. This quantitation method was successfully applied to the simultaneous determination of GFA and its metabolites in human plasma for the metabolic study and pharmacokinetic evaluation.
17827338	Identification of human liver cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in biotransformation of vicriviroc, a CCR5 receptor antagonist. Vicriviroc (SCH 417690), a CCR5 receptor antagonist, is currently under investigation for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus infection. The objective of this study was to identify human liver cytochrome P450 enzyme(s) responsible for the metabolism of vicriviroc. Human liver microsomes metabolized vicriviroc via N-oxidation (M2/M3), O-demethylation (M15), N,N-dealkylation (M16), N-dealkylation (M41), and oxidation to a carboxylic acid metabolite (M35b/M37a). Recombinant human CYP3A4 catalyzed the formation of all these metabolites, whereas CYP3A5 catalyzed the formation of M2/M3 and M41. CYP2C9 only catalyzed the formation of M15. There was a high correlation between the rates of formation of M2/M3, M15, and M41, which was determined using 10 human liver microsomal samples and testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation catalyzed by CYP3A4/5 (r > or = 0.91). Ketoconazole and azamulin (inhibitors of CYP3A4) were potent inhibitors of the formation of M2/M3, M15, M41, and M35b/M37a from human liver microsomes. A CYP3A4/5-specific monoclonal antibody (1 microg/microg of protein) inhibited the formation of all metabolites from human liver microsomes by 86 to 100%. The results of this study suggest that formation of the major vicriviroc metabolites in human liver microsomes is primarily mediated via CYP3A4. CYP2C9 and CYP3A5 most likely play a minor role in the biotransformation of this compound. These enzymology data will provide guidance to design clinical studies to address any potential drug-drug interactions.
23575872	Single-center evaluation of the single-dose pharmacokinetics of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist azilsartan medoxomil in renal impairment. Azilsartan medoxomil (AZL-M) is a potent angiotensin II receptor blocker that decreases blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner. It is a pro-drug and not detected in blood after oral administration because of rapid hydrolysis to the active moiety, azilsartan (AZL). AZL undergoes further metabolism to the major metabolite M-II and minor metabolites. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of AZL and its major metabolite. This was a single-center, open-label, phase I parallel-group study which examined the single-dose (40-mg) pharmacokinetics of AZL and M-II in 24 subjects with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis (n = 6 per group), respectively, and healthy matched subjects (n = 24). Renal impairment/disease did not cause clinically meaningful increases in exposure to AZL. M-II exposure was higher in all renally impaired subjects and highest in those with severe impairment (approx fivefold higher vs. control). M-II is pharmacologically inactive; increased exposure was not considered important in dose selection for AZL-M in subjects with renal impairment. Hemodialysis did not significantly remove AZL or M-II. Renal impairment had no clinically meaningful effect on the plasma protein binding of AZL or M-II. Single doses of AZL-M 40 mg were well tolerated in all subject groups. Based on the pharmacokinetic and tolerability findings, no dose adjustment of AZL-M is required for subjects with any degree of renal impairment, including end-stage renal disease.
16419413	Tissue distribution of loperamide and N-desmethylloperamide following a fatal overdose. We report a case involving a fatal intoxication with loperamide (Imodium). Loperamide is a synthetic opioid of the phenyl piperidine class used as an over-the-counter antidiarrheal. It exerts its effects through interaction with micro-opiate receptors in the intestine to reduce peristalsis. Loperamide lacks the typical euphoric opiate effects when administered at recommended doses. Both loperamide and its major metabolite, N-desmethylloperamide, were isolated by liquid-liquid extraction into n-butyl chloride from alkalinized samples. Extracts were analyzed by liquid chromatography-electrospray-mass spectrometry in selected-ion-monitoring mode. Rapid separation of the drug, metabolite, and internal standard (diphenoxylate) was achieved using a high-resolution C18 column with 1.8-microm particle diameter. The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid in deionized water (60%) and acetonitrile (40%) at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. Heart blood concentrations for loperamide and its metabolite were 1.2 mg/L and 3.3 mg/L, respectively. In contrast, reported peak plasma concentrations of loperamide after administration of recommended daily doses of 16 mg did not exceed 0.012 mg/L in controlled trials. Because the heart blood ethanol concentration was 0.08 g/dL, the medical examiner ruled that the cause of death was loperamide and ethanol intoxication, and the manner of death as undetermined.
7859374	Metabolic activation of the N-hydroxy derivative of the carcinogen 4-aminobiphenyl by human tissue sulfotransferases. The role of human sulfotransferase(s) in the bioactivation of the N-hydroxy (N-OH) metabolite of the human bladder carcinogen 4-aminobiphenyl (ABP) was investigated in vitro with human tissue cytosols. Using an enzymatic assay consisting of a PAPS-regenerating system, [3H]N-OH-ABP, calf thymus DNA and tissue cytosols, the sulfotransferase-mediated metabolic activation of N-OH-ABP was determined as the PAPS-dependent covalent binding of the N-OH substrate to DNA. With cytosols prepared from various tissues, we found that the sulfotransferase(s) in human liver, and to a lesser extent colon, can readily metabolize N-OH-ABP. No PAPS-dependent metabolic activation was detected with cytosols prepared from human pancreas or from the carcinogen target tissue, the urinary bladder epithelium. The N-OH-ABP sulfotransferase activities of liver and colon cytosols from different individuals were highly correlated with their thermostable phenol sulfotransferase (TS-PST) activity (liver, r = 0.99, P < 0.01; colon, r = 0.88, P < 0.01), but not with activities for the thermolabile phenol sulfotransferase (TL-PST; liver, r = 0.29; colon, r = 0.53), or for the dehydroepiandrosterone sulfotransferase (DHEA-ST; liver, r = 0.32; colon, negligible activity). N-OH-ABP sulfotransferase activity was highly sensitive to inhibition by a selective TS-PST inhibitor, 2,6-dichloro-4-nitrophenol (IC50 = 0.7 microM), and by p-nitrophenol, but was unaffected by competitive inhibitors of TL-PST (dopamine) or DHEA-ST (DHEA, DHEA-sulfate). The N-OH-ABP sulfotransferase activity also exhibited thermostability properties similar to that of the TS-PST. From these data, we conclude that human liver TS-PST but not TL-PST or DHEA-ST can metabolically activate the proximate human carcinogen N-OH-ABP to a reactive sulfuric acid ester intermediate that binds covalently to DNA. In addition, in view of the putative role of N-OH-ABP as a major transport form of the carcinogen to the urinary bladder and of the absence of sulfotransferase activity in this tissue, we hypothesize that sulfotransferase activation in the liver may actually decrease the bioavailability of N-OH-ABP toward extrahepatic tissues and thus serve as an important overall detoxification mechanism for the urinary bladder.
12485949	Mouse liver and kidney carboxylesterase (M-LK) rapidly hydrolyzes antitumor prodrug irinotecan and the N-terminal three quarter sequence determines substrate selectivity. Antitumor prodrug irinotecan is used for a variety of malignancies such as colorectal cancer. It is hydrolyzed to the metabolite, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38), which exerts its antineoplastic effect. Several human and rodent carboxylesterases are shown to hydrolyze irinotecan, but the overall activity varies from enzyme to enzyme. This report describes a novel mouse liver and kidney carboxylesterase (M-LK) that is highly active toward this prodrug. Northern analyses demonstrated that M-LK was abundantly expressed in the liver and kidney and slightly in the intestine and lung. Lysates from M-LK transfected cells exhibited a markedly higher activity on irinotecan hydrolysis than lysates from the cells transfected with mouse triacylglycerol hydrolase (TGH) (6.9 versus 1.3 pmol/mg/min). Based on the immunostaining intensity with purified rat hydrolase A, M-LK had a specific activity of 173 pmol/mg/min, which ranked it as one of the most efficient esterases known to hydrolyze irinotecan. A chimeric carboxylesterase and its wild-type enzyme (e.g., M-LKn and M-LK), sharing three quarters of the entire sequence from the N-terminus, exhibited the same substrate preference toward irinotecan and two other substrates, suggesting that the N-terminal sequence determines substrate selectivity. M-LK transfected cells manifested more severe cytotoxicity than TGH transfected cells upon being exposed to irinotecan. Topoisomerase I inhibitors such as irinotecan represent a promising class of anticancer drugs. Identification of M-LK as an efficient carboxylesterase to activate irinotecan provides additional sequence information to locate residues involved in irinotecan hydrolysis and thus facilitates the design of new analogs.
19015855	Disposition of desipramine, a sensitive cytochrome P450 2D6 substrate, when coadministered with intravenous temsirolimus. Intravenous (i.v.) temsirolimus, a novel inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), is approved for treatment of renal cell carcinoma. In vitro studies with pooled human liver microsomes showed that temsirolimus and its principal metabolite, sirolimus, inhibit the CYP2D6 isozyme (K(i) = 1.5 and 5 microM, respectively), indicating potential for pharmacokinetic interaction with agents that are substrates of CYP2D6. This 2-period study in healthy subjects investigated the pharmacokinetics of a single oral 50-mg dose of the CYP2D6 substrate desipramine, first without and subsequently with a single coadministered i.v. 25-mg dose of temsirolimus. The study population consisted of 25 males and 1 female; 10 were black, 12 were white, and 4 were of other races. Plasma and whole blood samples were available from all 26 subjects in period 1 following oral desipramine and from 23 subjects in period 2 following oral desipramine and i.v. temsirolimus coadministration. The 90% confidence intervals for least squares geometric mean ratios of desipramine and 2-hydroxy-desipramine C(max), AUC(T), and AUC were within 80-125%, indicating that parameter differences did not manifest into clinically relevant exposure changes. A single i.v. 25-mg dose of temsirolimus, alone or with desipramine, was well tolerated in healthy subjects. A single i.v. 25-mg dose of temsirolimus did not alter disposition of desipramine. Temsirolimus i.v. 25 mg may be safely administered with agents metabolized through the CYP2D6 pathway, but vigilance for drug interaction is warranted in patients with advanced malignancies.
17944539	Irreversible alkylation of human serum albumin by zileuton metabolite 2-acetylbenzothiophene-S-oxide: a potential model for hepatotoxicity. 2-acetylbenzothiophene-S-oxide (2-ABT-S-oxide or M1) is a reactive metabolite of zileuton, a drug used in the treatment of asthma and is capable of conjugating with glutathione in vitro. Human serum albumin (HSA) is the most abundant protein in plasma and plays a critical role in detoxifying reactive oxygen species. The current research is focused on understanding the interaction between M1 and HSA. The stability studies revealed the half-life of M1 to be about 0.85 h in HSA, 1.82 h in human plasma, and 4.48 h in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as determined by first-order approximation. The alkylation rate constant k for HSA was 20 M(-1) min(-1). After quenching with acetonitrile, the half-life of M1 did not change significantly, indicating that M1 is covalently bound to HSA. LC-MS and LC-MS/MS analysis of human plasma revealed the M1 alkylated peptide P (m/z 870) formed by HSA conjugation and concomitant water elimination. The specific amino acid on HSA bound to M1 was identified as Cys-34. This alkylation is observed to be concentration- and incubation-time-dependent in human plasma. HSA oxidized by N, N'-diacetyl-L-cystine exhibits a compromised ability of HSA to react with M1. The alkylated HSA diminished the binding affinity for warfarin. Furthermore, the alkylation was found to be irreversible in the dialysis experiment. In addition, M1 decomposes to 2-ABT in the presence of HSA, presumably acting as an oxidant. The formation of 2-ABT in the incubation and the self-condensation of M1 in PBS indicate that the alkylation of Cys-34 is only one of a number of reactions that occur in the presence of HSA. Irreversible protein modification may potentially lead to a loss of its function. HSA irreversible alkylation represents a model for other proteins to be potentially toxic and thus may help explain zileuton hepatotoxicity.
19147417	Validation of high performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection methods with simultaneous extraction procedure for the determination of artesunate, dihydroartemisinin, amodiaquine and desethylamodiaquine in human plasma for application in clinical pharmacological studies of artesunate-amodiaquine drug combination. With the expanded use of the combination of artesunate (AS) and amodiaquine (AQ) for the treatment of falciparum malaria and the abundance of products on the market, comes the need for rapid and reliable bioanalytical methods for the determination of the parent compounds and their metabolites. While the existing methods were developed for the determination of either AS or AQ in biological fluids, the current validated method allows simultaneous extraction and determination of AS and AQ in human plasma. Extraction is carried out on Supelclean LC-18 extraction cartridges where AS, its metabolite dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and the internal standard artemisinin (QHS) are separated from AQ, its metabolite desethylamodiaquine (DeAQ) and the internal standard, an isobutyl analogue of desethylamodiaquine (IB-DeAQ). AS, DHA and QHS are then analysed using Hypersil C4 column with acetonitrile-acetic acid (0.05M adjusted to pH 5.2 with 1.00M NaOH) (42:58, v/v) as mobile phase at flow rate 1.50ml/min. The analytes are detected with an electrochemical detector operating in the reductive mode. Chromatography of AQ, DeAQ and IB-DeAQ is carried out on an Inertsil C4 column with acetonitrile-KH(2)PO(4) (pH 4.0, 0.05M) (11:89, v/v) as mobile phase at flow rate 1.00ml/min. The analytes are detected by an electrochemical detector operating in the oxidative mode. The recoveries of AS, DHA, AQ and DeAQ vary between 79.1% and 104.0% over the concentration range of 50-1400ng/ml plasma. The accuracies of the determination of all the analytes are 96.8-103.9%, while the variation for within-day and day-to-day analysis are <15%. The lower limit of quantification for all the analytes is 20ng/ml and limit of detection is 8ng/ml. The method is sensitive, selective, accurate, reproducible and suited particularly for pharmacokinetic study of AS-AQ drug combination and can also be used to compare the bioavailability of different formulations, including a fixed-dose AS-AQ co-formulation.
21482104	Pharmacokinetics of cyclophosphamide and its metabolites in paediatric patients receiving high-dose myeloablative therapy. In order to better understand the impact of high-dose on the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of cyclophosphamide, a pharmacological study was performed in children with malignant mesenchymal tumours with metastatic disease. Patients received four courses of chemotherapy including two courses of cyclophosphamide. Plasma concentrations of cyclophosphamide and the metabolites 4-ketocyclophosphamide, dechloroethylcyclophosphamide and carboxyphosphamide were determined on days 1, 2 and 3 of each course. A population pharmacokinetic model for cyclophosphamide was developed using non-linear mixed effects modelling and metabolite AUC values were compared between days and courses. Data were available on 21 cyclophosphamide courses from 15 patients. A one compartment model, incorporating a term in surface area for both CL and V, best described cyclophosphamide pharmacokinetics. Typical CL and V on day 1 of treatment for a patient with a SA of 1.4m(2) were 4.3 L/h and 28.5L, respectively. On days 2 and 3 CL increased by 88% (95% CI, 72-105%) and 125% (95% CI, 108-145%) over day 1 levels; V increased by 14% (95% CI, 5-23%) on days 2 and 3. V tended to be larger for males than similarly sized females but no effect of age was found upon CL or V. Significant increases in metabolite AUCs were observed on days 2 and 3 compared to day 1 and a significant increase in CXCP AUC from course 1 to course 3. Administration of high-dose cyclophosphamide over several days results in an increase in metabolism, possibly by induction of the activation pathway. This induction is effectively reversed following a four week period between cyclophosphamide doses. The degree of intersubject variation in cyclophosphamide elimination is largely accounted for by body surface area and is less than previously reported.
16565170	N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase and 8-oxoguanine dna glycosylase metabolize the antiviral nucleoside 2-bromo-5,6-dichloro-1-(beta-D-ribofuranosyl)benzimidazole. The rapid in vivo degradation of the potent human cytomegalovirus inhibitor 2-bromo-5,6-dichloro-1-(beta-D-ribofuranosyl)benzimidazole (BDCRB) compared with a structural L-analog, maribavir (5,6-dichloro-2-(isopropylamino)-1-beta-L-ribofuranosyl-1H-benzimidazole), has been attributed to selective glycosidic bond cleavage. An enzyme responsible for this selective BDCRB degradation, however, has not been identified. Here, we report the identification of two enzymes, 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) and N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase (MPG), that catalyze N-glycosidic bond cleavage of BDCRB and its 2-chloro homolog, 2,5,6-trichloro-1-(beta-D-ribofuranosyl)benzimidazole, but not maribavir. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that free nucleosides are substrates of OGG1 and MPG. To understand how these enzymes might process BDCRB, docking and molecular dynamics simulations were performed with the native human OGG1 crystal coordinates. These studies showed that OGG1 was not able to bind a negative control, guanosine, yet BDCRB and maribavir were stabilized through interactions with various binding site residues, including Phe319, His270, Ser320, and Asn149. Only BDCRB, however, achieved orientations whereby its anomeric carbon, C1', could undergo nucleophilic attack by the putative catalytic residue, Lys249. Thus, in silico observations were in perfect agreement with experimental observations. These findings implicate DNA glycosylases in drug metabolism.
1812984	Stereospecific gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric assay of the chiral labetalol metabolite 3-amino-1-phenylbutane. We previously identified 3-amino-1-phenylbutane (APB) as an oxidative N-dealkylated, metabolite of the antihypertensive agent labetalol. Labetalol has two asymmetric centers and is used clinically as a mixture of the four possible stereoisomers; APB has one asymmetric center. We now report an enantiospecific gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric assay for APB in urine. After adding the internal standard 1-methyl-2-phenoxyethylamine and alkalinizing, the urine samples were extracted with ether. The extracts were derivatized with the optically active acid chloride prepared from (S)-alpha-methoxy-alpha-trifluoromethylphenylacetic acid. The derivatives were separated by capillary gas chromatography and detected by electron capture negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry with selected ion monitoring. The derivative of the R enantiomer eluted first, and the [M--32]- ions were monitored for both the drug and the internal standard. The method was linear in the 0.05-2.5 micrograms enantiomer-1 ml-1 range and had inter-assay and intra-assay coefficients of variation of less than 6%. The assay was used in the analysis of urine samples from a patient in labetalol therapy and no interference was found. Further studies are needed to elucidate the oxidative metabolism of labetalol and its stereochemical aspects.
12975337	Metabolism and pharmacokinetics of a dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor in rats, dogs, and monkeys with selective carbamoyl glucuronidation of the primary amine in dogs. The pharmacokinetics and metabolism of the l-threo isoleucine thiazolidide dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor, di-[2S,3S]-2-amino-3-methyl-pentanoic-1,3-thiazolidine fumarate (ILT-threo) and its allo stereoisomer (ILT-allo) were evaluated in rats, dogs, and monkeys. Both compounds were well absorbed (>80%) in all species, and most of the dose (>60%) was recovered in urine. Metabolites identified in all species included a sulfoxide (M1), a sulfone (M2), and a carbamoyl glucuronide (M3). For both compounds, parent drug had moderate systemic clearance in rats and dogs ( approximately 20-35 ml/min/kg in both species) and lower clearance in monkeys ( approximately 6-9 ml/min/kg). In rats, M1 was present in systemic circulation in concentrations similar to that of parent drug, whereas in dogs and monkeys, exposures to M1 were higher than for parent drug. In dogs, exposures to the sulfoxide metabolite were approximately 2 to 3 times higher after administration of ILT-allo than after administration of ILT-threo. Carbamoyl glucuronidation was an important biotransformation pathway in dogs. Circulating levels of M3 were significant in the dog, and present only in trace levels in rats and monkeys. M3 could be produced in in vitro systems in a NaHCO3 buffer under a CO2-saturated atmosphere and in the presence of UDP-glucuronic acid and alamethicin.
19833844	Comparative biotransformation of pyrazinone-containing corticotropin-releasing factor receptor-1 antagonists: minimizing the reactive metabolite formation. (S)-5-Chloro-1-(1-cyclopropylethyl)-3-(2,6-dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenylamino)pyrazin-2(1H)-one (BMS-665053), a pyrazinone-containing compound, is a potent and selective antagonist of corticotropin-releasing factor receptor-1 (CRF-R1) that showed efficacy in the defensive withdrawal model for anxiety in rats, suggesting its use as a potential treatment for anxiety and depression. In vitro metabolism studies of BMS-665053 in rat and human liver microsomes revealed cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation of the pyrazinone moiety, followed by ring opening, as the primary metabolic pathway. Detection of a series of GSH adducts in trapping experiments suggested the formation of a reactive intermediate, probably as a result of epoxidation of the pyrazinone moiety. In addition, BMS-665053 (20 mg/kg i.v.) underwent extensive metabolism in bile duct-cannulated (BDC) rats. The major drug-related materials in rat plasma were the pyrazinone oxidation products. In rat bile and urine (0-7 h), only a trace amount of the parent drug was recovered, whereas significant levels of the pyrazinone epoxide-derived metabolites and GSH-related conjugates were detected. Further evidence suggested that GSH-related conjugates also formed at the dichloroarylamine moiety possibly via an epoxide or a quinone imine intermediate. Other major metabolites in BDC rat bile and urine included glucuronide conjugates. To reduce potential liability due to metabolic activation of BMS-665053, a number of pyrazinone analogs with different substituents were synthesized and investigated for reactive metabolite formation, leading to the discovery of a CRF-R1 antagonist with diminished in vitro metabolic activation.
20484614	No dose adjustment on coadministration of the PDE4 inhibitor roflumilast with a weak CYP3A, CYP1A2, and CYP2C19 inhibitor: an investigation using cimetidine. This nonrandomized, fixed-sequence, 2-period crossover study investigated potential pharmacokinetic interactions between the phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor roflumilast, currently in clinical development for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the histamine 2 agonist cimetidine. Participants received roflumilast, 500 µg once daily, on days 1 and 13. Cimetidine, 400 mg twice daily, was administered from days 6 to 16. Pharmacokinetic analysis of roflumilast and its active metabolite roflumilast N-oxide was performed, and the ratio of geometric means for roflumilast alone and concomitantly with steady-state cimetidine was calculated. The effect of cimetidine on the total PDE4 inhibitory activity (tPDE4i; total exposure to roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide) was also calculated. Coadministration of steady-state cimetidine increased mean tPDE4i of roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide by about 47%. The maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) of roflumilast increased by about 46%, with no effect on C(max) of roflumilast N-oxide. The increase in tPDE4i of roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide following coadministration with cimetidine was mainly due to the inhibitory effect of cimetidine on cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP3A, and CYP2C19. These moderate changes indicate that dose adjustment of roflumilast is not required when coadministered with a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP3A, and CYP2C19, such as cimetidine.
2333716	Human biliary metabolites of isotretinoin: identification, quantification, synthesis, and biological activity. 1. The metabolites of isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid, Accutane) were investigated in the bile of two patients with biliary T-tube drainage after administration of a single, oral, 80-mg dose of 14C-isotretinoin. Radioactivity measurements showed that the two patients excreted 22.7 and 17.1% of the dose in their bile in 4 days. 2. The two major drug-related components in the bile were identified as the glucuronide conjugates of 4-oxo-isotretinoin and 16-hydroxy-isotretinoin. Two minor components were identified as the glucuronide conjugates of isotretinoin and 18-hydroxy-isotretinoin. 3. H.p.l.c. analyses of Glusulase-treated bile samples indicated that the glucuronides of isotretinoin and the two major metabolites accounted for about 48% and 44% of the total radioactivity in the bile of the two patients. 4. Racemic 16-hydroxy-isotretinoin was synthesized and evaluated for its effect on human sebocytes in vitro. This metabolite and the other major metabolites of isotretinoin were less active than isotretinoin in inhibiting the proliferation of the sebocytes.
23314398	High-sensitivity liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for the simultaneous determination of sodium picosulfate and its three major metabolites in human plasma. Sodium picosulfate (PICO-Na) is a member of the polyphenolic group of stimulant laxatives. Its major metabolites in humans are its active aglycone BHPM (bis-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-pyridyl-2-methane), the monoglucuronide (M1) and the monosulfate (M2) of BHPM. A sensitive, specific and rapid liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was established and validated for the simultaneous determination of picosulfate (PICO) and its three major metabolites in human plasma to investigate the pharmacokinetics of PICO and its major metabolites. Following protein precipitation with acetonitrile, chromatographic separation was achieved on a Luna 5u C(18)(2) column using gradient elution starting with 10% of 10mM ammonium acetate followed by increasing percentages of acetonitrile to eliminate interferences due to in-source conversion of the conjugated metabolites. Detection was performed on a tandem mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source operated in the positive mode, using the transitions of m/z 438.1→m/z 278.1 for PICO, m/z 278.1→m/z 184.2 for BHPM, m/z 454.1→m/z 184.2 for M1, and m/z 358.1→m/z 184.2 summed with m/z 358.1→m/z 278.1 for M2. Deuterium labeled compounds of the analytes were used as the internal standard, two of which, M1-d(12) and M2-d(12), were synthesized in-house. The method was validated in concentration ranges of 0.150-40.0 ng/mL for PICO and M2, 0.600-160 ng/mL for BHPM, and 0.045-12.0 ng/mL for M1 with acceptable accuracy and precision. The method was successfully applied to characterize the pharmacokinetic profiles of PICO and its metabolites in healthy volunteers after a single oral administration of 5mg PICO-Na.
18056281	Intracellular metabolism of the nucleotide prodrug GS-9131, a potent anti-human immunodeficiency virus agent. GS-9131 is a phosphonoamidate prodrug of the novel ribose-modified phosphonate nucleotide analog GS-9148 that demonstrates potent anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) activity and an excellent resistance profile in vitro. Prodrug moieties were optimized for the efficient delivery of GS-9148 and its active diphosphate (DP) metabolite to lymphoid cells following oral administration. To understand the intracellular pharmacology of GS-9131, incubations were performed with various types of lymphoid cells in vitro. The intracellular accumulation and antiviral activity levels of GS-9148 were limited by its lack of cellular permeation, and GS-9131 increased the delivery of GS-9148-DP by 76- to 290-fold relative to that of GS-9148. GS-9131 activation was saturable at high extracellular concentrations, potentially due to a high-affinity promoiety cleavage step. Once inside the cells, GS-9148 was efficiently phosphorylated, forming similar amounts of anabolites in primary lymphoid cells. The levels of GS-9148-DP formed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with HIV-1 were similar to that in uninfected PBMCs, and approximately equivalent intracellular concentrations of GS-9148-DP and tenofovir (TVF)-DP were required to inhibit viral replication by 90%. Once it was formed, GS-9148-DP was efficiently retained in activated CD4(+) cells, with a half-life of 19 h. In addition, GS-9131 showed a low potential for drug interactions with other adenine nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, based on the lack of competition for anabolism between suprapharmacologic concentrations of GS-9148 and TVF and the lack of activity of GS-9131 metabolites against purine nucleoside phosphorylase, an enzyme involved in the clearance of 2',3'-dideoxyinosine. Together, these observations elucidate the cellular pharmacology of GS-9131 and illustrate its efficient loading of lymphoid cells, resulting in a prolonged intracellular exposure to the active metabolite GS-9148-DP.
14742144	S-oxidation of S-methyl-esonarimod by flavin-containing monooxygenases in human liver microsomes. 1. Studies using human liver microsomes and recombinant human cytochrome P450 (CYP) and flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) were performed to identify the enzymes responsible for the metabolism of S-methyl-esonarimod (M2), an active metabolite of esonarimod (KE-298, a novel antirheumatic drug). 2. S-oxidative activities of M2 significantly correlated with those of methyl p-tolyl sulfide, a specific substrate of FMOs, as tested using 10 different human liver microsomes (r(2) = 0.539, p<0.05). Thermal treatment of microsomes reduced the S-oxidative activity in the absence of the NADPH-generating system at 45 degrees C for 5 min. However, methimazole, a known competitive substrate of FMOs, was a weak inhibitor of the S-oxidation in liver microsomes. 3. Recombinant human FMO1 and FMO5 produced M3 in greater quantities than recombinant human FMO3. The S-oxidation of M2 by recombinant human FMO5 was not appreciably inhibited in the presence of methimazole. In contrast, methimazole was effective in suppressing the catalytic activity of recombinant human FMO1 and FMO3. 4. The apparent K(m) (K(m app)) for the S-oxidation of M2 in human recombinant FMO5 (2.71 microM) was similar to that obtained using human liver microsomes (2.43 microM). 5. The present results suggest that the S-oxidation of S-methyl esonarimod reflects FMO5 activity in the human liver because the recombinant FMO5 data match well with the human liver microsomal experiments.
14997211	2-Amino metabolites are key mediators of CB 1954 and SN 23862 bystander effects in nitroreductase GDEPT. An important feature of gene-directed enzyme-prodrug therapy is that prodrug activation can provide diffusible cytotoxic metabolites capable of generating a local bystander effect in tumours. Activation of the aziridinyl dinitrobenzamide CB 1954 by E. coli nitroreductase (NTR) provides a bystander effect assumed to be due to the potently cytotoxic 4-hydroxylamine metabolite. We show that there are four cytotoxic extracellular metabolites of CB 1954 in cultures of NTR-expressing tumour cells (the 2- and 4-hydroxylamines and their corresponding amines). The 4-hydroxylamine is the most cytotoxic in DNA crosslink repair defective cells, but the 2-amino derivative (CB 10-236) is of similar potency to the 4-hydroxylamine in human tumour cell lines. Importantly, CB 10-236 has much superior diffusion properties to the 4-hydroxylamine in multicellular layers grown from the SiHa human cervical carcinoma cell line. These results suggest that the 2-amine, not the 4-hydroxylamine, is the major bystander metabolite when CB 1954 is activated by NTR in tumours. The corresponding dinitrobenzamide nitrogen mustard SN 23862 is reduced by NTR to form a single extracellular metabolite (also the 2-amine), which has superior cytotoxic potency and diffusion properties to the CB 1954 metabolites. These results are consistent with the reported high bystander efficiency of SN 23862 as an NTR prodrug in multicellular layers and tumour xenografts.
18952506	A liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay for the determination of irinotecan (CPT-11) and its two major metabolites in human liver microsomal incubations and human plasma samples. A sensitive, rapid LC-MS/MS assay has been developed and validated for the simultaneous quantification of CPT-11 and its two principal metabolites, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38), and 7-ethyl-10-[4-N-(5-aminopentanoic acid)-1-piperidino]carbonyloxy-camptothecin (APC) in human liver microsomal fractions and plasma. The method was linear over the ranges of 1.56-100 ng/mL, 3.13-150 ng/mL, and 0.78-100 ng/mL for CPT-11, SN-38, and APC, respectively. The total run time was 7.0 min. This assay offers advantages in terms of expediency, recovery of analytes, and suitability for the analysis of CPT-11 and its metabolites in various biological fluids.
15902980	Urinary excretion of alpha-hydroxytriazolam following a single dose of halcion. As an approved medicinal product and reportedly an abused substance that have been associated with death and "considered to be a factor...of impaired driving, sexual assault, and other violent crimes", triazolam is controlled at the same level (Level III) as flunitrazepam in Taiwan. Alleged misuses of this substance have been associated with case specimens submitted to this laboratory. A sample preparation (with and without enzymatic hydrolysis) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry protocols were evaluated and applied to the analysis of free and total alpha-hydroxytriazolam (the main metabolite of triazolam) in urine. Ions designated for TMS-derivatized alpha-hydroxytriazolam and alpha-hydroxytriazolam-d4 are m/z 415, 417, and 430 and 419, 421, and 434, respectively. The overall protocol achieved the following results when applied to the analysis of 2-mL drug-free urine specimens fortified with 10-200 ng/mL alpha-hydroxytriazolam: recovery, 95%; interday and intraday precision ranges, 1.50-3.52% and 0.93-4.71%, respectively; linearity, r2 > 0.99; and limits of detection and quantitation, 0.05 and 0.1 ng/mL, respectively. This protocol was applied to the analysis of case specimens and urine samples collected from two patients (A and B) taking one oral dose of Halcion (0.25 mg triazolam). Excretion profiles of free and total alpha-hydroxytriazolam show that free alpha-hydroxytriazolam is detectable, but at very low levels (< 5 ng/mL). Peak excretion of total alpha-hydroxytriazolam occurs at approximately 5-10 h following the drug intake. Total alpha-hydroxytriazolam is excreted at detectable levels approximately 2-35 h following an oral dose of 0.25 mg triazolam. Total free and conjugated alpha-hydroxytriazolam excreted by A and B are 0.61% and 31.6%; and 0.36% and 57.2% of the dose, respectively.
16381669	Novel metabolites of buprenorphine detected in human liver microsomes and human urine. The in vitro metabolism of buprenorphine was investigated to explore new metabolic pathways and identify the cytochromes P450 (P450s) responsible for the formation of these metabolites. The resulting metabolites were identified by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. In addition to norbuprenorphine, two hydroxylated buprenorphine (M1 and M2) and three hydroxylated norbuprenorphine (M3, M4, and M5) metabolites were produced by human liver microsomes (HLMs), with hydroxylation occurring at the tert-butyl group (M1 and M3) and at unspecified site(s) on the ring moieties (M2, M4, and M5). Time course and other data suggest that buprenorphine is N-dealkylated to form norbuprenorphine, followed by hydroxylation to form M3; buprenorphine is hydroxylated to form M1 and M2, followed by N-dealkylation to form M3 and M4 or M5. The involvement of selected P450s was investigated using cDNA-expressed P450s coupled with scaling models, chemical inhibition, monoclonal antibody (MAb) analysis, and correlation studies. The major enzymes involved in buprenorphine elimination and norbuprenorphine and M1 formation were P450s 3A4, 3A5, 3A7, and 2C8, whereas 3A4, 3A5, and 3A7 produced M3 and M5. Based on MAb analysis and chemical inhibition, the contribution of 2C8 was higher in HLMs with higher 2C8 activity, whereas 3A4/5 played a more important role in HLMs with higher 3A4/5 activity. Examination of human urine from subjects taking buprenorphine showed the presence of M1 and M3; most of M1 was conjugated, whereas 60 to 70% of M3 was unconjugated.
21045200	Absorption and disposition of the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator fingolimod (FTY720) in healthy volunteers: a case of xenobiotic biotransformation following endogenous metabolic pathways. Fingolimod [(FTY720), Gilenya; 2-amino-2-[2-(4-octylphenyl)ethyl]-1,3-propanediol], a new drug for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis, acts through its phosphate metabolite, which modulates sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors. This represents a novel mechanism of action. In the present work, the absorption and disposition of (14)C-labeled fingolimod were investigated in healthy male volunteers after a single oral dose of 4.5 mg. Total radioactivity was determined in blood, urine, and feces. Fingolimod was quantified in blood. Metabolite profiles were determined in blood and excreta, and metabolite structures were elucidated by mass spectrometry, wet-chemical methods, and comparison with reference compounds. Fingolimod was absorbed slowly but almost completely. The biotransformation of fingolimod involved three main pathways: 1) reversible phosphorylation to fingolimod phosphate [(S)-enantiomer, active principle]; 2) ω-hydroxylation at the octyl chain, catalyzed predominantly by CYP4F enzymes, followed by further oxidation to a carboxylic acid and subsequent β-oxidation; and 3) formation of ceramide analogs by conjugation with endogenous fatty acids. This metabolism is quite unusual because it follows metabolic pathways of structurally related endogenous compounds rather than biotransformations typical for xenobiotics. The elimination of fingolimod was slow and occurred predominantly by oxidative metabolism whereas fingolimod phosphate was eliminated mainly by dephosphorylation back to fingolimod. Drug-related material was excreted mostly in the urine in the form of oxidation products.
14742135	Comparison of the metabolism of ethylene glycol and glycolic acid in vitro by precision-cut tissue slices from female rat, rabbit and human liver. 1. The metabolism of [1,2-(14)C]-ethylene glycol and [1,2-(14)C]-glycolic acid was studied in vitro using precision-cut tissue slices prepared from the livers of female Sprague-Dawley rats, New Zealand white rabbits and humans. The time-course for production of metabolites formed from ethylene glycol at concentrations from 3 to 40 mM was determined to compare quantitatively the differences between species in the rates and amounts of formation of glycolic acid, the presumed developmental toxicant of ethylene glycol. The rates of metabolism of glycolic acid to glyoxylic acid at concentrations from 0.05 to 16 mM by liver tissue from the different species were also determined. The apparent V(max)/K(m) for the metabolic conversions of ethylene glycol to glycolic acid and for glycolic acid to glyoxylic acid in liver tissue from the different species were obtained. 2. There were qualitative differences in the metabolic profiles and quantitative differences in the formation of glycolic acid between the mammalian liver systems. There was an average of 10-fold less glycolic acid produced by liver slices from rabbits compared with rats. With the human liver, the formation of glycolic acid was not detectable using tissue from three of four human donors. A low level of glycolic acid was detected in one liver slice incubation from one of the four subjects, but only at one extended time point; glyoxylate was detected with liver slices from all four humans. 3. Liver slices prepared from female Sprague-Dawley rats, female New Zealand White rabbits and three female human subjects all metabolized glycolic acid to glyoxylic acid. Human liver tissue was the most effective at further metabolizing glycolic acid to glyoxylic acid. The ratios of V(max)/K(m), representing the relative clearance of glycolic acid from liver tissue, were approximately 14:9:1 for human, rat and rabbit liver, respectively. 4. Precision-cut liver slices maintained in dynamic organ culture are good predictors of metabolism by liver tissue in vivo. The results of the present study therefore indicate that levels of glycolic acid, if formed in vivo, following exposures to similar concentrations of ethylene glycol, would be lower in humans than in rabbits and rats.
22472641	Simultaneous determination of flumatinib and its two major metabolites in plasma of chronic myelogenous leukemia patients by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Flumatinib is an antineoplastic tyrosine kinase inhibitor used for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Its major metabolites in the circulation are N-desmethyl flumatinib (M1) and amide hydrolysis product (M3). To investigate the pharmacokinetics of flumatinib in CML patients, a simple, specific and rapid liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of flumatinib and its two major metabolites in patient plasma. After a simple, one-step protein precipitation with methanol, flumatinib, its two metabolites, and internal standard (HHGV-E) were separated on a C(18) column using an isocratic mobile phase of methanol:5mM ammonium acetate:formic acid (60:40:0.4, v/v/v). A total chromatographic run time of 4.2 min was achieved. The detection was performed in multiple reaction monitoring mode, using the transitions of m/z 563→m/z 463 for flumatinib, m/z 549→m/z 463 for M1, m/z 303→m/z 175 for M3, and m/z 529→m/z 429 for HHGV-E. The method was linear over the concentration ranges of 0.400-400 ng/mL for flumatinib, 0.100-100 ng/mL for M1, and 0.200-200 ng/mL for M3, using only 50 μL of plasma. The intra- and inter-day precisions were less than 8.5% for flumatinib, 9.8% for M1, and 10.6% for M3 in terms of the relative standard deviation. The accuracy was within ± 2.2% for flumatinib, ± 6.0% for M1, and ± 9.9% for M3 in terms of relative error. The validated method was successfully applied to clinical pharmacokinetic studies of flumatinib mesylate in CML patients following oral administration at all dosage regimens.
12235447	Clinical pharmacokinetics of irinotecan and its metabolites in relation with diarrhea. Our objective was to build population pharmacokinetic models that describe plasma concentrations of irinotecan (CPT-11) and its metabolites 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38) and SN-38 glucuronide (SN-38G) and to investigate the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships between drug exposure and diarrhea, the major dose-limiting toxicity. Data were obtained from 109 patients (65 men and 44 women) who received 1.5-hour (range, 0.75- to 2.25-hour) intravenous infusions of irinotecan at doses that ranged from 100 to 350 mg/m(2); 44 patients had a second course. The population pharmacokinetic models were developed to describe plasma concentration-time profiles. The area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to 60 hours [AUC (0-60)] was used as a measure of drug exposure to model the probabilities of diarrhea with use of a logistic regression model. A 3-compartment pharmacokinetic model best described the disposition of irinotecan, whereas SN-38 and SN-38G showed 2-compartmental characteristics. The population estimate of clearance for irinotecan was 31.6 L/h, and the volume of distribution at steady-state (V(SS)) was 263 L. The clearance divided by formation fraction (F(m)) was 712 L/h and 66.8 L/h for SN-38 and SN-38G, respectively. The V(SS)/F(m) was 72,000 L for SN-38 and 85.4 L for SN-38G. The frequencies of diarrhea scores in this study were 46% (grade 0), 28% (grade 1), 20% (grade 2), 4% (grade 3), and 2% (grade 4). Significant correlations between AUC(0-60) and diarrhea scores were found for irinotecan (P <.05) and SN-38G (P <.01) but not for SN-38 or the biliary index. In this population analysis, irinotecan and SN-38G AUC values were appropriate predictors of the risk for diarrhea, and SN-38G AUC showed the stronger relationship of the two. The developed population models may be useful in further clinical development of this agent.
8971957	Cyclosporin nephrotoxicity in relation to its metabolism in psoriasis. Cyclosporine (CsA) and some of its metabolites (M9, M17, M18, M21) have been determined by means of an LC-MASS method in eight psoriatic patients developing nephrotoxicity. In comparison with a control group (15 psoriatics who after the same period of time, with the same daily dose, did not develop nephrotoxicity) they showed an increase of CsA metabolites, especially M17. Because M17 blood concentrations in the nephrotoxic group tended to be higher than in the control group from the first week of treatment we suggest that M17 might be considered a marker of ongoing nephrotoxicity.
20200232	In vitro glucuronidation of 2,2-bis(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanediol by microsomes and hepatocytes from rats and humans. 2,2-Bis(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanediol (BMP) is a brominated flame retardant used in unsaturated polyester resins. In a 2-year bioassay BMP was shown to be a multisite carcinogen in rats and mice. Because glucuronidation is the key metabolic transformation of BMP by rats, in this study the in vitro hepatic glucuronidation of BMP was compared across several species. In addition, the glucuronidation activities of human intestinal microsomes and specific human hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes for BMP were determined. To explore other possible routes of metabolism for BMP, studies were conducted with rat and human hepatocytes. Incubation of hepatic microsomes with BMP in the presence of UDP-glucuronic acid resulted in the formation of a BMP monoglucuronide. The order of hepatic microsomal glucuronidation activity of BMP was rats, mice >> hamsters > monkeys >>> humans. The rate of glucuronidation by rat hepatic microsomes was 90-fold greater than that of human hepatic microsomes. Human intestinal microsomes converted BMP to BMP glucuronide at a rate even lower than that of human hepatic microsomes. Among the human UGT enzymes tested, only UGT2B7 had detectable glucuronidation activity for BMP. BMP monoglucuronide was the only metabolite formed when BMP was incubated with suspensions of freshly isolated hepatocytes from male F-344 rats or with cryopreserved human hepatocytes. Glucuronidation of BMP in human hepatocytes was extremely low. Overall, the results support in vivo studies in rats in which BMP glucuronide was the only metabolite found. The poor glucuronidation capacity of humans for BMP suggests that the pharmacokinetic profile of BMP in humans will be dramatically different from that of rodents.
12433805	Enzyme kinetics for the formation of 3-hydroxyquinine and three new metabolites of quinine in vitro; 3-hydroxylation by CYP3A4 is indeed the major metabolic pathway. The formation kinetics of 3-hydroxyquinine, 2'-quininone, (10S)-11-dihydroxydihydroquinine, and (10R)-11-dihydroxydihydroquinine were investigated in human liver microsomes and in human recombinant-expressed CYP3A4. The inhibition profile was studied by the use of different concentrations of ketoconazole, troleandomycin, and fluvoxamine. In addition, formation rates of the metabolites were correlated to different enzyme probe activities of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 in microsomes from 20 human livers. Formation of 3-hydroxyquinine had the highest intrinsic clearance in human liver microsomes (mean +/- S.D.) of 11.0 +/- 4.6 micro l/min/mg. A markedly lower intrinsic clearance, 1.4 +/- 0.7, 0.5 +/- 0.1, and 1.1 +/- 0.2 micro l/min/mg was measured for 2'-quininone, (10R)-11-dihydroxydihydroquinine and (10S)-11-dihydroxydihydroquinine, respectively. Incubation with human recombinant CYP3A4 resulted in a 20-fold higher intrinsic clearance for 3-hydroxyquinine compared with 2'-quininone formation whereas no other metabolites were detected. The formation rate of 3-hydroxyquinine was completely inhibited by ketoconazole (1 micro M) and troleandomycin (80 micro M). Strong inhibition was observed on the formation of 2'-quininone whereas the formation of (10S)-11-dihydroxydihydroquinine was partly inhibited by these two inhibitors. No inhibition on the formation of (10R)-11-dihydroxydihydroquinine was observed. There was a significant correlation between the formation rates of quinine metabolites and activities of the CYP3A4 selected marker probes. This in vitro study demonstrates that 3-hydroxyquinine is the principal metabolite of quinine and CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in this metabolic pathway.
14634046	Effect of age on in vitro triazolam biotransformation in male human liver microsomes. We studied age-related changes in enzyme kinetic parameters in human liver microsomes (HLMs) in vitro, using triazolam (TRZ), an index of CYP3A activity. HLMs were prepared from male livers from four age groups, n = 5 per group: A (14-20 years), B (21-40 years), C (41-60 years), and D (61-72 years). Mean V(max) values in groups B and C for both 1-hydroxytriazolam (1-OH-TRZ) and 4-hydroxy-triazolam (4-OH-TRZ) formation were significantly greater as compared with groups A and D individually, as well as the net intrinsic clearance (sum of the two pathways). The mean net intrinsic clearance (Cl(int)) values were 25.2, 89.8, 78, and 20.6 nl/min/mg protein in A, B, C, and D, respectively. TRZ Cl(int) correlated well with total CYP3A content (r(s) = 0.84; P < 0.0001). Testosterone (TST) inhibited 1-OH-TRZ formation and activated 4-OH-TRZ formation in all age groups, with no significant differences among the groups; this suggests that the drug-drug interaction potential using TRZ and TST as index CYP3A substrates may not change with age. Reduced V(max) and Cl(int) for TRZ hydroxylation and CYP3A protein in livers from elderly men suggest reduced CYP3A gene expression in this group.
21060109	Safety and pharmacokinetics of IDX184, a liver-targeted nucleotide polymerase inhibitor of hepatitis C virus, in healthy subjects. IDX184 is a nucleotide prodrug designed to enhance formation in the liver of the active triphosphate of 2'-methylguanosine (2'-MeG), a potent and specific polymerase inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV). In the present study, single ascending oral doses of 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 mg IDX184 were administered sequentially to cohorts of 8 healthy subjects, randomized 6:2, active/placebo. Plasma and urine pharmacokinetic sampling was performed over a period of 120 h after dosing. Upon absorption, IDX184 rapidly disappeared from plasma, with a mean half-life (t(1/2)) of approximately 1 h, while plasma concentrations of 2'-MeG gradually increased. Consistent with a liver-targeting approach, plasma exposure of IDX184 and 2'-MeG was low and was also dose related: the mean maximum concentrations ranged from 1.1 to 17 ng/ml for IDX184 and 1.7 to 19 ng/ml for 2'-MeG, and the respective mean total area under the curve ranged from 1.2 to 22.7 and 17.3 to 334 ng·h/ml. Mean 2'-MeG plasma concentrations 24 h after dosing were 0.6 to 3 ng/ml for the 25- to 100-mg doses. Mean 2'-MeG t(1/2) values ranged from 18 to 43 h for doses of 25 mg and above. Mean cumulative urine excretion was 0.2% and 12 to 20% of administered doses for the unchanged IDX184 and 2'-MeG, respectively. IDX184 was safe and well tolerated; no serious adverse events (SAEs), dose-dependent adverse events (AEs), or dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The incidence of AEs and laboratory abnormalities was low and was similar among subjects receiving IDX184 or a placebo. All AEs were mild to moderate and resolved at the end of study. The favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profiles support further clinical evaluation of IDX184 in HCV-infected patients.
12505783	Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of cis-9,10-epoxyoctadecanoic acid (cis-EODA). I. Direct evidence for cis-EODA formation from oleic acid oxidation by liver microsomes and isolated hepatocytes. Oleic acid, cis-9-octadecenoic acid, is the major fatty acid in mammals. Its oxide, cis-9,10-epoxyoctadecanoic acid (cis-EODA), has been identified in blood and urine of humans, its origin is, however, still unknown. Lipid peroxidation and enzyme-catalyzed epoxidation of oleic acid are two possible sources. In the present article, we investigated by HPLC and GC-MS whether cis-EODA is formed enzymatically from oleic acid by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system. Oleic acid, cis-EODA and its hydratation product threo-9,10-dihydroxyoctadecanoic acid (threo-DiHODA) were quantitated by HPLC as their p-bromophenacyl esters. For structure elucidation by GC-MS, the pentafluorobenzyl (PFB) esters of these compounds were isolated by HPLC and converted to their trimethylsilyl ether derivatives. Liver microsomes of rats, rabbits and humans oxidized oleic acid into cis-EODA. This is the first direct evidence for the enzymatic formation of cis-EODA from oleic acid. The epoxidation of oleic acid was found to depend on CYP, NADPH+H(+), and O(2). cis-EODA was measurable in incubates of liver microsomes for up to 30 min of incubation. Maximum cis-EODA concentrations were reached after 5-7 min of incubation and found to depend upon oleic acid concentration. Isolated rat hepatocytes hydratated cis-EODA into threo-DiHODA which was further converted to unknown metabolites. However, from incubation of oleic acid with these cells we could not detect threo-DiHODA or cis-EODA. Our study suggests that circulating and excretory cis-EODA may originate, at least in part, from CYP-catalyzed epoxidation of oleic acid. GC-MS of intact cis-EODA as its PFB ester in the negative-ion chemical ionization mode should be useful in investigating the physiological role of cis-EODA in man.
9070593	Pharmacokinetics of oxcarbazepine and carbamazepine in human placenta. To study the transfer and metabolism of oxcarbazepine (OCBZ) and 10-hydroxy-10,11-dihydrocarbamazepine (10-OH-CBZ) and carbamazepine (CBZ) metabolism and its possible induction in human placenta. A dual recirculating human placental perfusion system, blood sampling, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and enzyme assays. OCBZ was metabolized into 10-OH-CBZ in five human placental cotyledons perfused for 2 h in a dual recirculating perfusion system. The same metabolite was found by HPLC in three sample pairs of maternal and cord blood taken during delivery from patients on OCBZ therapy. In all of the clinical samples, 10,11-trans-dihydroxy-10,11-dihydrocarbamazepine (10,11-D) was also found, but not in the perfusions. In addition, 10-OH-CBZ was not metabolized in the placental perfusions. The transfer of OCBZ through the perfused placentas was quicker than the transfer of antipyrine, while the transfer of 10-OH-CBZ was slower. Both OCBZ and 10-OH-CBZ also accumulated in placental tissue. CBZ metabolism was studied in three perfusions using placentas from mothers on CBZ therapy. No metabolism could be detected in the perfused placentas, while metabolites were found in both maternal and cord blood of the same mothers. Another series of placentas of mothers on CBZ therapy did not differ significantly from the placenta of a healthy mother as to CYP activities or the level of CYP3A4 mRNA. OCBZ is metabolized into 10-OH-CBZ to some extent in human placenta in vitro, suggesting that the placenta also participates in the metabolism of OCBZ in vivo. On the contrary, the placenta does not participate in the metabolism of CBZ. No induction of placental CBZ metabolism in vitro can be detected after maternal CBZ treatment during pregnancy.
22538270	Effect of gemfibrozil on the metabolism of brivaracetam in vitro and in human subjects. Brivaracetam (BRV) is a new high-affinity synaptic vesicle protein 2A ligand in phase III for epilepsy. Initial studies suggested that the hydroxylation of BRV into BRV-OH is supported by CYP2C8. Other metabolic routes include hydrolysis into a carboxylic acid derivative (BRV-AC), which could be further oxidized into a hydroxy acid derivative (BRV-OHAC). The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of gemfibrozil (CYP2C9 inhibitor) and its 1-O-β-glucuronide (CYP2C8 inhibitor) on BRV disposition both in vivo (healthy participants) and in vitro (human liver microsomes and hepatocytes). In a two-period randomized crossover study, 26 healthy male participants received a single oral dose of 150 mg of BRV alone or at steady state of gemfibrozil (600 mg b.i.d). Gemfibrozil did not modify plasma and urinary excreted BRV, BRV-OH, or BRV-AC. The only observed change was a modest decrease (approximately -40%) in plasma and urinary BRV-OHAC. In human hepatocytes and/or liver microsomes, gemfibrozil potently inhibited the hydroxylation of BRV-AC into BRV-OHAC (K(I) 12 μM) while having a marginal effect on BRV-OH formation (K(I) ≥153 μM). Gemfibrozil-1-O-β-glucuronide had no relevant effect on either reaction (K(I) >200 μM). In conclusion, gemfibrozil did not influence the pharmacokinetics of BRV and its hydroxylation into BRV-OH. Overall, in vitro and in vivo data suggest that CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 are not involved in BRV hydroxylation, whereas hydroxylation of BRV-AC to BRV-OHAC is likely to be mediated by CYP2C9.
19095720	Pinoline may be used as a probe for CYP2D6 activity. Pinoline, 6-methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-beta-carboline, is a serotonin analog that selectively inhibits the activity of monoamine oxidase-A and shows antidepressant activity. Our previous study using a panel of recombinant cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes suggests that pinoline O-demethylation may be selectively catalyzed by polymorphic CYP2D6. The current study, therefore, aimed to delineate the impact of CYP2D6 status on pinoline metabolism. Enzyme kinetic studies using recombinant CYP2D6 allelic isozymes revealed that CYP2D6.2 exhibited 5-fold lower enzyme efficiency (V(max)/K(m)) toward pinoline compared with CYP2D6.1, and CYP2D6.10 did not show any catalytic activity. Inhibition study showed that quinidine (1 microM) completely blocked pinoline O-demethylase activity in human liver microsomes, whereas other P450 isoform-selective inhibitors had no or minimal effects. Pinoline O-demethylase activities in 10 human liver microsomes showed significantly strong correlation with bufuralol 1'-hydroxylase activities (R(2)=0.93; p<0.0001) and CYP2D6 contents (R(2)=0.82; p=0.005), whereas no appreciable correlations with enzymatic activities of other P450 enzymes were found. Furthermore, we compared pinoline urinary metabolic ratio (pinoline/6-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-beta-carboline) between CYP2D6-humanized and wild-type control mice after intraperitoneal injection of pinoline (30 mg/kg). Results indicated that the two genotyped mice were clearly distinguished by pinoline metabolic ratio (mean +/- S.D.), which was much higher in wild-type mice (0.29+/-0.19, n=4) than in CYP2D6-humanized transgenic mice (0.0070+/-0.0048, n=4). Our findings suggest that pinoline O-demethylation is governed by CYP2D6 status, and pinoline, at a proper concentration or dose, may be a good probe to evaluate CYP2D6 activity.
21176727	High absolute bioavailability of the new oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor roflumilast. To establish basic intravenous (IV) pharmacokinetics of roflumilast (ROF) and its pharmacologically active metabolite roflumilast N-oxide (R-NO) and to determine the absolute bioavailability of ROF in humans. In a randomized, open-label, 2-period, 2-sequence crossover study 12 healthy male subjects were randomized to receive ROF either orally (PO) 500 µg (immediate release tablets) or single IV (150 µg over 15 min). Plasma concentrations were determined. Dose-adjusted point estimates and 90% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for the ratio of the AUC time curves using a multiplicative model and parametric analysis. After IV administration, clearance of ROF was 0.14 l/h/kg, volume of distribution (Vd area) 2.92 l/kg, and the terminal t1/2 was 14.8 h. After PO administration, ROF was rapidly absorbed; the absolute bioavailability was 79%. The AUC of the R-NO metabolite generally exceeded that of ROF. After IV and PO administration, the metabolic ratios were 7.4 and 12.4, respectively. Dose-adjusted analysis of the R-NO AUC values indicate a 21% higher R-NO formation seen with PO vs. IV, suggesting entire first-pass conversion of ROF is to the active R-NO. Formation/clearance processes of the R-NO appear to be slow with an observed tmax of 6.9 - 8.8 h, and corresponding to apparent t1/2 values of 22.7 h and 20.6 h, after IV and PO administration, respectively. ROF is rapidly absorbed after PO administration and exhibits high absolute bioavailability and low clearance pharmacokinetics. The total exposure of R-NO exceeds that of ROF by a factor of 12 after oral administration.
21300142	Low occupational exposure to benzene in a petrochemical plant: modulating effect of genetic polymorphisms and smoking habit on the urinary t,t-MA/SPMA ratio. The identification of reliable biomarkers is critical for the assessment of occupational exposure of benzene: S-phenylmercapturic acid (SPMA) and trans,trans-muconic acid (t,t-MA) are the most currently used. t,t-MA is an open-ring metabolite, but it is also a metabolite of the food preservative sorbic acid, while SPMA is formed by conjugation with glutathione, and several studies suggested that the genetic polymorphism of glutathione S-transferases modulates its production. This study compared the ability of these metabolites to assess the benzene exposure in a big group of petrochemical workers. Furthermore, investigated how genetic polymorphism of glutathione S-transferase theta 1 (GSTT1), glutathione S-transferase mu 1 (GSTM1), glutathione S-transferase pi 1 (GSTP1) and smoking habits, may influence their excretion. Results showed that occupational exposure to benzene was negligible compared to that from smoking and confirmed the modulating effect of the genetic polymorphism of GSTT1 on the urinary excretion of SPMA, but not of t, t-MA, even at very low levels of benzene exposure. The same effect was found for GSTM1, but only for smokers. The t,t-MA/SPMA ratio was not a constant value and resulted to be higher than the corresponding Biological Exposure Index (BEI) ratio, which is currently equal to 20. Higher values of metabolite have been associated with the GSTT1 or GSTM1 null genotype and these are responsible for increase health risk. We suggest that this ratio could be used as a marker of individual susceptibility for subjects with benzene exposure.
12712459	Effect of intrapatient dosage escalation of irinotecan on its pharmacokinetics in pediatric patients who have high-grade gliomas and receive enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant therapy. The authors set out to determine the effect of intrapatient dose escalation of irinotecan on its disposition in pediatric patients with high-grade glioma who received concomitant enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants (EIAs). During Course 1, a 60-minute intravenous infusion of irinotecan (20 mg/m(2) per day) was administered once daily for 5 days on each of 2 consecutive weeks. The authors measured the concentrations of the lactone forms of irinotecan and its metabolites 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38), SN-38 glucuronide, and 7-ethyl-10-[4-N-(5-aminopeptanoic acid)-1-piperidino]-carbonyloxycamptothecin (APC) in serial plasma samples collected on Days 1 and 12 of Course 1. For the 6 patients who received EIAs but whose SN-38 areas under the concentration-time curve (AUCs) on Day 1 were below clinically significant levels, irinotecan dosage was increased, and subsequent pharmacokinetic studies were performed. Thirty-five patients were enrolled. The rate of irinotecan clearance was greater for patients who received EIAs than for those who did not (P = 0.0008), whereas systemic exposure to irinotecan (P = 0.02) and SN-38 (P = 0.0001) was lower for those treated with EIAs than for those who were not. Of the 6 patients whose irinotecan dosages were increased, 3 experienced an increase in the SN-38 AUC between Days 1 and 12. For 1 patient, the SN-38 AUC on Day 12 was lower than on Day 1; this result likely was due to an increased dose of EIAs during the same period. Despite irinotecan dose escalation to 60 and 80 mg/m(2), the SN-38 AUCs for 2 patients did not increase to clinically significant levels. The type and grade of toxicity did not differ between the two patient groups. Increasing the dosage of irinotecan increased the SN-38 AUC in some patients who received concomitant EIA therapy.
12811361	The Karolinska cocktail for phenotyping of five human cytochrome P450 enzymes. Our objectives were (1) to determine whether the drugs caffeine, losartan, omeprazole, debrisoquin (INN, debrisoquine), and quinine can be given simultaneously in low doses as a cocktail for the phenotyping of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4, respectively, and (2) to design an administration schedule to give as few sampling occasions as possible. Twenty-four subjects were given oral doses of 100 mg caffeine, 25 mg losartan, 20 mg omeprazole, 10 mg debrisoquin, and 250 mg quinine on separate days. After a washout period of at least 4 days, all drugs were given simultaneously except for quinine, which was given 8 hours after the other drugs. Blood and urine samples were collected to determine parent drug and metabolite concentrations for assessment of phenotyping indices. Any difference between both single and cocktail doses was tested on a log-normal distribution. The phenotypic indices of CYP1A2 (paraxanthine/caffeine in 4-hour plasma), CYP2C9 (losartan/E-3174 [metabolite of losartan] in 0- to 8-hour urine), CYP2C19 (omeprazole/5-hydroxyomeprazole in 3-hour plasma), and CYP3A4 (quinine/3-hydroxyquinine in 16-hour plasma) were not significantly changed when probe drugs were administered alone compared with together, although a tendency toward higher concentrations of losartan was seen during simultaneous administration (95% confidence interval, 0.51-1.002; P =.051). The CYP2D6 phenotypic index (debrisoquin/4-hydroxydebrisoquin in 0- to 8-hour urine) was significantly changed when drugs were given together (95% confidence interval, 0.45-0.87; P =.007), indicating an inhibition of the debrisoquin metabolism. The within-subject coefficients of variation (8%-25%) were much lower than the between-subject coefficients of variation (34%-79%). The administration of drugs together suggests an inhibition of debrisoquin metabolism caused by the concurrent drugs given. By separating debrisoquin from the other cocktail drugs, this method is likely to be used as a tool to phenotype the enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 with only 2 urinary collections and 2 blood-sampling occasions.
16678548	Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral oxycodone in healthy human subjects: role of circulating active metabolites. In vitro experiments suggest that circulating metabolites of oxycodone are opioid receptor agonists. Clinical and animal studies to date have failed to demonstrate a significant contribution of the O-demethylated metabolite oxymorphone toward the clinical effects of the parent drug, but the role of other putative circulating active metabolites in oxycodone pharmacodynamics remains to be examined. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oxycodone were investigated in healthy human volunteers; measurements included the time course of plasma concentrations and urinary excretion of metabolites derived from N-demethylation, O-demethylation, and 6-keto-reduction, along with the time course of miosis and subjective opioid side effects. The contribution of circulating metabolites to oxycodone pharmacodynamics was analyzed by pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling. The human study was complemented by in vitro measurements of opioid receptor binding and activation studies, as well as in vivo studies of the brain distribution of oxycodone and its metabolites in rats. Urinary metabolites derived from cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A-mediated N-demethylation of oxycodone (noroxycodone, noroxymorphone, and alpha- and beta-noroxycodol) accounted for 45% +/- 21% of the dose, whereas CYP2D6-mediated O-demethylation (oxymorphone and alpha- and beta-oxymorphol) and 6-keto-reduction (alpha- and beta-oxycodol) accounted for 11% +/- 6% and 8% +/- 6% of the dose, respectively. Noroxycodone and noroxymorphone were the major metabolites in circulation with elimination half-lives longer than that of oxycodone, but their uptake into the rat brain was significantly lower compared with that of the parent drug. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling indicated that the time course of pupil constriction is fully explained by the plasma concentration of the parent drug, oxycodone, alone. The metabolites do not contribute to the central effects, either because of their low potency or low abundance in circulation or as a result of their poor uptake into the brain. CYP3A-mediated N-demethylation is the principal metabolic pathway of oxycodone in humans. The central opioid effects of oxycodone are governed by the parent drug, with a negligible contribution from its circulating oxidative and reductive metabolites.
16506809	Urolithins, ellagic acid-derived metabolites produced by human colonic microflora, exhibit estrogenic and antiestrogenic activities. Urolithins A and B (hydroxy-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one derivatives) are colonic microflora metabolites recently proposed as biomarkers of human exposure to dietary ellagic acid derivatives. Molecular models suggest that urolithins could display estrogenic and/or antiestrogenic activity. To this purpose, both urolithins and other known phytoestrogens (genistein, daidzein, resveratrol, and enterolactone) were assayed to evaluate the capacity to induce cell proliferation on the estrogen-sensitive human breast cancer MCF-7 cells as well as the ability to bind to alpha- and beta-estrogen receptors. Both urolithins A and B showed estrogenic activity in a dose-dependent manner even at high concentrations (40 microM), without antiproliferative or toxic effects, whereas the other phytoestrogens inhibited cell proliferation at high concentrations. Overall, urolithins showed weaker estrogenic activity than the other phytoestrogens. However, both urolithins displayed slightly higher antiestrogenic activity (antagonized the growth promotion effect of 17-beta-estradiol in a dose-dependent manner) than the other phytoestrogens. The IC(50) values for the ERalpha and ERbeta binding assays were 0.4 and 0.75 microM for urolithin A; 20 and 11 microM for urolithin B; 3 and 0.02 for genistein; and 2.3 and 1 for daidzein, respectively; no binding was detected for resveratrol and enterolactone. Urolithins A and B entered into MCF-7 cells and were metabolized to yield mainly urolithin-sulfate derivatives. These results, together with previous studies regarding absorption and metabolism of dietary ellagitannins and ellagic acid in humans, suggest that the gut microflora metabolites urolithins are potential endocrine-disrupting molecules, which could resemble other described "enterophytoestrogens" (microflora-derived metabolites with estrogenic/antiestrogenic activity). Further research is warranted to evaluate the possible role of ellagitannins and ellagic acid as dietary "pro-phytoestrogens".
19063590	Bioactivation of lumiracoxib by peroxidases and human liver microsomes: identification of multiple quinone imine intermediates and GSH adducts. Lumiracoxib (Prexige; 2-[(2-fluoro-6-chlorophenyl)amino]-5-methyl-benzeneacetic acid) is a cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor for the symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis. Recently, the drug has been withdrawn in several countries due to serious liver side effects. Li et al. recently have shown that lumiracoxib is bioactivated to a proposed quinone imine that is trapped by N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to form two NAC adducts in human and rat liver microsomal incubations. The current study demonstrated that the lumiracoxib metabolite 4'-hydroxylumiracoxib (M5) can also be bioactivated by peroxidases such as horseradish peroxidase, myeloperoxidase, and prostaglandin H synthases. Efforts were also made to identify GSH adducts formed by P450s in human liver microsomal incubations of lumiracoxib. We herein report the detection and characterization of mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra-GSH adducts in these oxidizing systems. Most of the conjugates were generated as a result of bioactivation of M5 by both peroxidases and P450s. Quinone imine (M15) and two GSH-conjugated quinone imines (M17 and M18) were identified as intermediates in the formation of these conjugates. The latter two were formed through sequential elimination of the fluorine and chlorine groups of GSH-conjugated M15. An additional GSH adduct, which appeared to be formed directly from parent, was only observed in human liver microsomal incubations. A mechanism was proposed for the bioactivation of lumiracoxib and the formation of the observed GSH adducts. These results suggest that bioactivation of lumiracoxib and M5 may result in GSH depletion, covalent binding to proteins, and oxidative stress and may potentially lead to hepatotoxicity.
20001672	CYP3A catalyses schizandrin biotransformation in human, minipig and rat liver microsomes. Schizandrin is recognized as the major absorbed effective constituent of Fructus schisandrae, which is extensively applied in Chinese medicinal formula. The present study aimed to profile the phase I metabolites of schizandrin and identify the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms involved. After schizandrin was incubated with human liver microsomes, three metabolites were isolated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and their structures were identified to be 8(R)-hydroxyl-schizandrin, 2-demethyl-8(R)-hydroxyl-schizandrin, 3-demethyl-8(R)-hydroxyl-schizandrin, by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and (13)C-NMR, respectively. A combination of correlation analysis, chemical inhibition studies, assays with recombinant CYPs, and enzyme kinetics indicated that CYP3A4 was the main hepatic isoform that cleared schizandrin. Rat and minipig liver microsomes were included when evaluating species differences, and the results showed little difference among the species. In conclusion, CYP3A4 plays a major role in the biotransformation of schizandrin in human liver microsomes. Minipig and rat could be surrogate models for man in schizandrin pharmacokinetic studies. Better knowledge of schizandrin's metabolic pathway could provide the vital information for understanding the pharmacokinetic behaviours of schizandrin contained in Chinese medicinal formula.
20940093	Development and validation of a highly sensitive GC/MS method for the determination of buprenorphine and nor-buprenorphine in blood. A sensitive and specific GC/MS method for the determination of buprenorphine (BPN) and its main metabolite nor-buprenorphine (nor-BPN) in blood has been developed, optimized and validated. Sample preparation includes solid-phase extraction of both analytes and their derivatization with acetic anhydride in pyridine. BPN-d4 was used as internal standard for the determination of both analytes. Limits of detection and quantification for BPN and nor-BPN were 0.02 and 0.05 μg/L, respectively. The calibration curves were linear within the dynamic range of each analyte (0.05-30.0 μg/L) with a correlation coefficient higher than 0.996. Absolute recovery ranged from 90.2 to 97.6% for both analytes and their internal standard. Intra- and inter-day accuracy was found to be between -5.40 to 1.73% and -2.45 to 2.80%, respectively, while intra- and inter-day precision were less than 5.8 and 4.7%, for both analytes. The method was applied to real blood samples obtained from patients that follow BPN maintenance program. The developed method can be used in routine every day analysis by clinical and forensic laboratories, for pharmacokinetic studies, for therapeutic drug level monitoring in order to adjust BPN dosage of BPN maintained patients or for the investigation of forensic cases.
15327972	Improved antiviral activity of the aryloxymethoxyalaninyl phosphoramidate (APA) prodrug of abacavir (ABC) is due to the formation of markedly increased carbovir 5'-triphosphate metabolite levels. The anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activity of abacavir (ABC; 1-(1S,4R)-4-[2-amino-6-(cyclopropylamino)-9H-purin-9-yl]-2-cyclopentene-1-methanol) could be markedly enhanced by administering the aryloxymethoxyalaninyl phosphoramidate prodrug derivative of ABC (pro-ABC-MP) to virus-infected cell cultures. Metabolic studies with radiolabeled ABC and pro-ABC-MP in human T-lymphocyte and primary macrophage cell cultures revealed a significantly increased delivery of the activated (phosphorylated) metabolite of ABC (ABC-MP) by pro-ABC-MP, and the concomittant appearance of markedly higher intracellular levels of carbovir 5'-triphosphate (CBV-TP), which represents the eventual antivirally active metabolite of ABC. The intracellular amounts of ABC-MP and appearance of CBV-TP closely correlated with the extracellular pro-ABC-MP concentrations that were administered to the cell cultures within a concentration range between 0.5 and 100 microM. The highest amounts of CBV-TP were observed within 6-24 h after drug administration. The improved delivery of ABC-MP and metabolic conversion to CBV-TP explain the markedly enhanced antiviral activity of the prodrug of ABC, and warrant further exploration of this prodrug technology on ABC and related compounds to further enhance and optimize their antiviral efficacy.
17268056	In vitro metabolism of (-)-camphor using human liver microsomes and CYP2A6. The in vitro metabolism of (-)-camphor was examined in human liver microsomes and recombinant enzymes. Biotransformation of (-)-camphor was investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). (-)-Camphor was oxidized to 5-exo-hydroxyfenchone by human liver microsomal cytochrome (P450) enzymes. The formation of metabolites of (-)-camphor was determined by the relative abundance of mass fragments and retention time on gas chromatography (GC). CYP2A6 was the major enzyme involved in the hydroxylation of (-)-camphor by human liver microsomes, based on the following lines of evidence. First, of eleven recombinant human P450 enzymes tested, CYP2A6 catalyzed the oxidation of (-)-camphor. Second, oxidation of (-)-camphor was inhibited by (+)-menthofuran and anti-CYP2A6 antibody. Finally, there was a good correlation between CYP2A6 contents and (-)-camphor hydroxylation activities in liver microsomes of 9 human samples.
17200836	Inhibition of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 catalyzed metabolism of alprazolam and quinine by ketoconazole as racemate and four different enantiomers. The antifungal drug ketoconazole (KTZ) is known as an inhibitor of, especially, the CYP3A subfamily, which catalyzes the metabolism of a large variety of drugs. Interactions between KTZ and CYP3A substrates have been reported both in vivo and in vitro. Most of them, however, involved the KTZ racemate. KTZ racemate and the separate enantiomers, 2R,4R; 2R,4S; 2S,4S, and 2S,4R, were evaluated for their selectivity in inhibiting alprazolam and quinine metabolism. The inhibition of alprazolam and quinine metabolism was studied in an in vitro system of human liver microsomes (HLM), recombinant of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. The concentrations of formed 3-hydroxyquinine and 4- and alpha-hydroxyalprazolam were measured by HPLC and LC-MS, respectively. Quinine 3-hydroxylation was catalyzed to a similar extent by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. The formation rate of 4-hydroxyalprazolam was higher than that of alpha-hydroxyalprazolam for each HLM, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. KTZ racemate and enantiomers showed differential inhibitory effects of quinine and alprazolam metabolism. Quinine metabolism catalyzed by HLM, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 was potently inhibited by the trans-enantiomer KTZ 2S,4S, with IC(50) value of 0.16 microM for HLM, 0.04 microM for CYP3A4 and 0.11 microM for CYP3A5. The same enantiomer showed the lowest IC(50) values of 0.11 microM for HLM and 0.04 microM for CYP3A5 with respect to alprazoalm 4-hydroxylation and also the same pattern for alprazolamalpha-hydroxylation, 0.13 microM for HLM and 0.05 microM for CYP3A5. Alprazolam metabolism (both alpha- and 4- hydroxylations) catalyzed by CYP3A4 was inhibited potently by the cis-enantiomer KTZ 2S,4R, with IC(50) values of 0.03 microM. Alprazolam and quinine metabolism is catalyzed by both CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. The present study showed that different KTZ enantiomers inhibit CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 to different degrees, indicating that structural differences among the enantiomers would be related to their inhibitory potency on these two enzymes.
3770018	Formation of didesmethylethimizol (4-5-dicarbamoyl-1-ethylimidazole) in man. The chemical structure of an ethimizol metabolite found earlier in human urine and saliva was established as 4,5-dicarbamoyl-1-ethylimidazole (didesmethylethimizol). The treatment of biological samples comprised a solid-phase extraction, high-performance thin-layer chromatographic separation and high-performance liquid chromatographic purification techniques. The identification of the metabolite was based on the comparison of a mass spectrum of the substance isolated from the biological fluid with the mass spectra of synthetised reference compounds.
21189331	The intestine as an important contributor to prasugrel active metabolite formation in vivo. Prasugrel [2-acetoxy-5-(α-cyclopropylcarbonyl-2-fluorobenzyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine], a thienopyridine antiplatelet agent, undergoes rapid hydrolysis in vivo to a thiolactone intermediate, 2-[2-oxo-6,7-dihydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridin-5(4H)-yl]-1-cyclopropyl-2-(2-fluorophenyl)ethanone (R-95913), which is further converted to a pharmacologically active metabolite, 2-[1-2-cyclopropyl-1-(2-fluorophenyl)-2-oxoethyl]-4-mercapto-3-piperidinylidene acetic acid (R-138727), by oxidation via cytochromes P450. In this study, we investigated how much the intestine and liver contribute to the formation of R-95913 and R-138727 after intraduodenal administration of prasugrel (1 mg/kg) to portal vein- and hepatic vein-cannulated dogs. The areas under the plasma concentration-time curve up to 2 h of R-95913 in the portal, hepatic, and systemic veins were 525, 32, and 17 ng · h/ml, respectively, and those of R-138727 were 564, 529, and 495 ng · h/ml, respectively. The dose of prasugrel was absorbed and then converted to R-95913 and R-138727 by 93 and 13%, respectively, in the intestine. In the liver, 23% of the R-95913, which passed through the intestine, was converted to R-138727. In conclusion, this is the first report to directly demonstrate that the conversion of prasugrel to R-138727 in the intestine is comparable to that converted in the liver of dogs.
11376561	Expression of CYP2A6 in tumor cells augments cellular sensitivity to tegafur. To examine the role of cytochrome P450 2A6 (CYP2A6) in the cellular sensitivity to an anti-tumor prodrug, tegafur (FT), a CYP2A6 cDNA construct was transfected into cells of a colon cancer cell line, DLD-1. CYP2A6-expressing cells (DLD-1 / CYP2A6 cells) more efficiently catalyzed the conversion of FT to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (2.6-fold) and the 7-hydroxylation of coumarin (7.9-fold) than cells transfected with a null construct (DLD-1 / null cells). These results indicated that the expressed CYP2A6 was functionally active. The extent of growth inhibition of the DLD-1 / CYP2A6 cells by FT was greater than that of DLD-1 / null cells; the difference between the DLD-1 / CYP2A6 and DLD-1 / null cells was statistically significant at the concentrations of 250, 500 and 1000 mM. 5-FU, an active metabolite of FT, inhibited the growth of both types of cells to the same extent. Thus, intracellular expression of CYP2A6 can sensitize cells to FT.
15831782	Single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of levovirin valinate hydrochloride (R1518) in healthy volunteers. R1518 is a valine ester prodrug of levovirin as an investigational new drug for the treatment of hepatitis C virus. Two phase 1, single- and multiple-dose studies were conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of R1518 in healthy volunteers. After oral dosing, R1518 was rapidly and exclusively converted to levovirin. Levovirin plasma concentrations peaked at 2 hours, with T(1/2) ranging from 6 to 8 hours. The T(1/2) of R1518 was less than 1 hour, with relative exposures (R1518/levovirin) less than 6%. A high-fat meal did not affect the pharmacokinetics. The female groups in both studies had higher plasma levels than males did due to age and renal function difference. An accumulation ratio of 1.3 to 1.5 was observed with the twice-daily regimen. About 75% to 90% of the levovirin equivalent dose was recovered in urine. Increase in exposure was slightly disproportionate to increase in dose. Significantly improved oral absorption of levovirin was achieved following administration of R1518.
15769123	Allicin and allicin-derived garlic compounds increase breath acetone through allyl methyl sulfide: use in measuring allicin bioavailability. Progress in establishing systemic pharmacological effects for fresh, crushed garlic (Allium sativum L) in humans has been hindered by (1) the inability to measure allicin bioavailability, (2) lack of direct evidence that allicin has significant systemic activity at doses of garlic normally consumed, and (3) lack of a model for an acute effect. We have addressed these problems by quantifying the increases in breath acetone and breath allyl methyl sulfide (AMS). The area under the 48 h curve was measured in humans after consumption of standardized garlic preparations, allicin, and allicin-derived compounds, at the equivalent of 7 g of crushed garlic. It was shown that the allyl thiosulfinates (mainly allicin) are solely responsible for breath AMS and increased breath acetone. Diallyl trisulfide, diallyl disulfide, ajoene, and S-allylmercaptocysteine, at isomolar dithioallyl, showed the same quantitative effects as allicin. Consumption of AMS at isomolar allyl also gave the same effects as allicin, indicating that AMS is the main metabolite of allicin and is an active metabolite. In conclusion, allicin and allicin-derived compounds are rapidly metabolized to AMS, a compound which stimulates the production of acetone and which can be used to measure the bioavailability of allicin and, hence, the ability of garlic supplements to represent fresh garlic.
19761716	Influence of age, gender, and race on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of fesoterodine. Fesoterodine, a new antimuscarinic agent for overactive bladder, undergoes immediate and extensive hydrolysis by nonspecific esterases to 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the metabolite principally responsible for its antimuscarinic activity. Formation of 5-HMT does not require cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated metabolism, but its further metabolism and inactivation involves CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 isoenzymes. Subject age, gender, and race can play a key role in inter-subject variability in pharmacokinetics and thus efficacy and safety of drugs. This article examines the effects of age, gender, and race on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of fesoterodine. Data from two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials in healthy subjects are presented: Study 1 investigated the effects of race (white vs. black men) and Study 2 investigated the effects of age (young vs. old men) and gender (elderly men vs. elderly women) on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single doses of fesoterodine 8 mg. In both studies, the primary endpoints were area under the concentration-time curve up to the last sample (AUC0-tz) and maximum concentration (Cmax) of 5-HMT in plasma. Pharmacodynamic variables included spontaneous salivary secretion (Studies 1 and 2) and residual urine volume (Study 2 only). The two studies included 5 groups of 16 subjects each (randomized 3 : 1 to fesoterodine or placebo): white men aged 18 - 45 years, black men aged 18 - 45 years (Study 1); young white men aged 18 - 40 years, elderly white men aged > 65 years, and elderly white women aged > 65 years (Study 2). There were no clinically meaningful differences in the primary endpoints between white and black subjects or between young white men, elderly white men, and elderly white women. Mean AUC0-tz was 70.7 ng/ml x h in whites and 64.1 ng/ml x h in blacks; mean Cmax was 6.1 and 5.5 ng/ml in whites and blacks, respectively. Mean AUC0-tz in young white men, elderly white men, and elderly white women was 49, 48, and 54 ng/ml x h, respectively; mean Cmax in young white men, elderly white men, and elderly white women was 4.1, 3.8, and 4.6 ng/ml, respectively. Consistent with the anticholinergic pharmacology of fesoterodine, declines in salivary volume were observed in both studies, and elevations in residual urinary volume were observed, especially in elderly subjects, in Study 2. Fesoterodine was well tolerated, with common adverse events such as headache and dry mouth recognized as antimuscarinic class effects. Subject demographics, such as age, gender, and race, do not have a clinically meaningful effect on 5-HMT pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics after single-dose administration of fesoterodine 8 mg; thus, no dosage adjustment is required for fesoterodine based on age, gender, or race.
17062777	Comparative metabolism of radiolabeled muraglitazar in animals and humans by quantitative and qualitative metabolite profiling. Muraglitazar (Pargluva), a dual alpha/gamma peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) activator, has both glucose- and lipid-lowering effects in animal models and in patients with diabetes. This study describes the in vivo and in vitro comparative metabolism of [(14)C]muraglitazar in rats, dogs, monkeys, and humans by quantitative and qualitative metabolite profiling. Metabolite identification and quantification methods used in these studies included liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS), LC/tandem MS, LC/radiodetection, LC/UV, and a newly described mass defect filtering technique in conjunction with high resolution MS. After oral administration of [(14)C]muraglitazar, absorption was rapid in all species, reaching a concentration peak for parent and total radioactivity in plasma within 1 h. The most abundant component in plasma at all times in all species was the parent drug, and no metabolite was present in greater than 2.5% of the muraglitazar concentrations at 1 h postdose in rats, dogs, and humans. All metabolites observed in human plasma were also present in rats, dogs, or monkeys. Urinary excretion of radioactivity was low (<5% of the dose) in all intact species, and the primary route of elimination was via biliary excretion in rats, monkeys, and humans. Based on recovered doses in urine and bile, muraglitazar showed a very good absorption in rats, monkeys, and humans. The major drug-related components in bile of rats, monkeys, and humans were glucuronides of muraglitazar and its oxidative metabolites. The parent compound was a minor component in bile, suggesting extensive metabolism of the drug. In contrast, the parent drug and oxidative metabolites were the major components in feces, and no glucuronide conjugates were found, suggesting that glucuronide metabolites were excreted in bile and hydrolyzed in the gastrointestinal tract. The metabolites of muraglitazar resulted from both glucuronidation and oxidation. The metabolites in general had greatly reduced activity as PPARalpha/gamma activators relative to muraglitazar. In conclusion, muraglitazar was rapidly absorbed, extensively metabolized through glucuronidation and oxidation, and mainly eliminated in the feces via biliary excretion of glucuronide metabolites in all species studied. Disposition and metabolic pathways were qualitatively similar in rats, dogs, monkeys, and humans.
6684541	Review of single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of the monobactam, aztreonam (SQ 26,776) in healthy subjects. Aztreonam (SQ 26,776) is a new, completely synthetic, monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic with potent activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacteria. The pharmacokinetics of single intravenous doses of 125-4,000 mg, single intramuscular doses of 250-1,000 mg, and multiple intravenous and intramuscular doses of 500 and 1,000 mg q.8 h during 7 days, were studied in 90 healthy male subjects. The half-life was 1.7, apparent volume of distribution 0.2 liters/kg, serum protein binding 56%, and urinary excretion 60-70% of the dose. No significant accumulation or change in pharmacokinetics of aztreonam was found during q.8 h dosing. Small amounts of the biologically inactive open beta-lactam ring metabolite, SQ 26,992, were found in the urine. Aztreonam level in serum and urine after 500- to 2,000-mg doses were potentially therapeutic for most Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
15355884	Fluorinated 2-(4-amino-3-methylphenyl)benzothiazoles induce CYP1A1 expression, become metabolized, and bind to macromolecules in sensitive human cancer cells. Fluorinated 2-(4-amino-3-methylphenyl)benzothiazoles possess potent antiproliferative activity against certain cancer cells, similar to the unfluorinated 2-(4-amino-3-methylphenyl)benzothiazole (DF 203, NSC 674495). In "sensitive" cancer cells, DF 203 is metabolized by, can induce expression of, and binds covalently to CYP1A1. Metabolism appears to be essential for its antiproliferative activity through DNA adduct formation. However, a biphasic dose-response relationship compromises its straightforward development as a chemotherapeutic agent. We investigated whether fluorinated benzothiazoles inhibit cancer cell growth without the biphasic dose-response, and whether the fluorinated benzothiazoles are also metabolized into reactive species, with binding to macromolecules in sensitive cancer cells. One fluorinated benzothiazole, 2-(4-amino-methylphenyl)-5-fluorobenzothiazole (5F 203, NSC 703786) did exhibit potent, antiproliferative activity without a biphasic dose-response. The fluorinated benzothiazoles were also metabolized only in cells, which subsequently showed evidence of cell death. We used microsomes from genetically engineered human B-lymphoblastoid cells expressing cytochromes P450 (CYP1A1, CYP1A2, or CYP1B1) to clarify the basis for fluorinated benzothiazole metabolism. 5F 203 induced CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNA expression in sensitive breast and renal cancer cells, whereas 5F 203 induced CYP1A1 mRNA but not CYP1B1 mRNA expression in sensitive ovarian cancer cells. 5F 203 did not induce CYP1A1 or CYP1B1 mRNA expression in any "resistant" cancer cells. The fluorinated benzothiazoles induced CYP1A1 protein expression exclusively in sensitive cells. [14C]5F 203 bound substantially to subcellular fractions in sensitive cells but only minimally in resistant cells. These data are concordant with the antiproliferative activity of fluorinated benzothiazoles deriving from their ability to become metabolized and bind to macromolecules within sensitive cells.
7214799	Nalidixic acid kinetics after single and repeated oral doses. The kinetics of nalidixic acid (NA) and its two metabolites, 7-hydroxynalidixic acid (HNA) and 7-carboxynalidixic acid (CNA) were studied after a single oral dose and after two doses a day for 7 days. Total unconjugated NA, HNA, and CNA concentrations in plasma and urine samples were assayed by a new high-pressure liquid chromatographic (HPLC) technique. NA was rapidly absorbed and hydroxylated to HNA. Both were rapidly excreted in urine with an apparent elimination half-life (t1/2) of 6 to 7 hr. CNA was never detected in the plasma, although it accounted for about 25% of total urinary NA and metabolites. No major sex-related differences in the kinetics and the metabolic pattern were observed. During the 7-day treatment there was no significant cumulation of NA and HNA. The study demonstrated that the concentration of the active compounds, unconjugated NA and HNA, was more than five times the minimum bacteria inhibiting concentration for 8 hr after drug and slightly above this concentration during the next 4 hr.
8535411	Involvement of CYP2C in the metabolism of cannabinoids by human hepatic microsomes from an old woman. The hepatic microsomal metabolism of cannabinoids was studied using the liver from an old woman. delta 8-Tetrahydrocannabinol, delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol were biotransformed to their respective 11-hydroxy metabolites by a microsomal fraction with specific activities (pmol/min/mg protein) of 29.1, 47.1 and 27.9, respectively. In addition, both 11-oxo-delta 8-tetrahydrocannabinol and 11-oxo-delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol were metabolized to the corresponding carboxylic acids with the microsomes. An antibody against mouse CYP2C29 almost completely inhibited 11-hydroxylation of the cannabinoids and microsomal aldehyde oxygenase (MALDO) activity for 11-oxo-delta 8-tetrahydrocannabinol and 11-oxo-delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol, used as substrates, whereas an antibody against rat CYP3A2 conversely stimulated the 11-hydroxylation of delta 8-tetrahydrocannabinol and MALDO activity for 11-oxo-delta 8-tetrahydrocannabinol. The results indicate that a member of CYP2C is primarily responsible for the metabolism of the above cannabinoids in the human hepatic microsomes.
18431571	Altered cyclophosphamide and thiotepa pharmacokinetics in a patient with moderate renal insufficiency. We report a patient with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance, CL(cr) = 38 mL/min) who received high-dose chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide (1,500 mg/m(2) day(-1)), thiotepa (120 mg/m(2) day(-1)) and carboplatin (AUC = 5 mg min/mL day(-1)) for four consecutive days. Blood samples were collected on day 1 and 3 and plasma levels of cyclophosphamide, its active metabolite 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide, thiotepa, its main metabolite tepa and carboplatin were determined. Pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that the elimination of cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, carboplatin, but especially tepa was strongly reduced in this patient, resulting in increased exposures to these compounds of 67, 43, 30 and 157%, respectively, compared to a reference population (n = 24) receiving similar doses. Exposure to 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide increased 11%. These results suggest that it may not be necessary to alter the dose of cyclophosphamide in patients with moderate renal impairment. However, because high exposures to thiotepa and tepa have been correlated with increased toxicity, caution should be applied when administering thiotepa to patients with renal insufficiency.
19460943	Metabolite profiling of hydroxycinnamate derivatives in plasma and urine after the ingestion of coffee by humans: identification of biomarkers of coffee consumption. Human subjects drank coffee containing 412 mumol of chlorogenic acids, and plasma and urine were collected 0 to 24 h after ingestion and were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Within 1 h, some of the components in the coffee reached nanomole peak plasma concentrations (C(max)), whereas chlorogenic acid metabolites, including caffeic acid-3-O-sulfate and ferulic acid-4-O-sulfate and sulfates of 3- and 4-caffeoylquinic acid lactones, had higher C(max) values. The short time to reach C(max) (T(max)) indicates absorption of these compounds in the small intestine. In contrast, dihydroferulic acid, its 4-O-sulfate, and dihydrocaffeic acid-3-O-sulfate exhibited much higher C(max) values (145-385 nM) with T(max) values in excess of 4 h, indicating absorption in the large intestine and the probable involvement of catabolism by colonic bacteria. These three compounds, along with ferulic acid-4-O-sulfate and dihydroferulic acid-4-O-glucuronide, were also major components to be excreted in urine (8.4-37.1 mumol) after coffee intake. Feruloylglycine, which is not detected in plasma, was also a major urinary component (20.7 mumol excreted). Other compounds, not accumulating in plasma but excreted in smaller quantities, included the 3-O-sulfate and 3-O-glucuronide of isoferulic acid, dihydro(iso)ferulic acid-3-O-glucuronide, and dihydrocaffeic acid-3-O-glucuronide. Overall, the 119.9 mumol excretion of the chlorogenic acid metabolites corresponded to 29.1% of intake, indicating that as well as being subject to extensive metabolism, chlorogenic acids in coffee are well absorbed. Pathways for the formation of the various metabolites within the body are proposed. Urinary dihydrocaffeic acid-3-O-sulfate and feruloylglycine are potentially very sensitive biomarkers for the consumption of relatively small amounts of coffee.
18843263	Elucidating rifampin's inducing and inhibiting effects on glyburide pharmacokinetics and blood glucose in healthy volunteers: unmasking the differential effects of enzyme induction and transporter inhibition for a drug and its primary metabolite. The effects of single doses of intravenous (IV) ciprofloxacin and rifampin and of multiple doses of rifampin on glyburide exposure and blood glucose levels were investigated in nine healthy volunteers. A single IV dose of rifampin significantly increased the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of glyburide and its metabolite. Blood glucose levels were significantly lower than those observed after dosing with glyburide alone. Multiple doses of rifampin induced an increase in liver enzyme levels, leading to a marked decrease in glyburide exposure and blood glucose levels. When IV rifampin was administered after multiple doses of rifampin, the inhibition of hepatic uptake transporters masked the induction effect; however, the relative changes in AUC for glyburide and its hydroxyl metabolite were similar to those seen under noninduced conditions. The studies reported here demonstrate how measurements of the levels of both the parent drug and its primary metabolite are useful in unmasking simultaneous drug-drug induction and inhibition effects and in characterizing enzymatic vs. transporter mechanisms.
7325647	Bioavailability of bacampicillin and talampicillin, two oral prodrugs of ampicillin. A 200-mg amount of bacampicillin showed a significantly higher relative extent of bioavailability than did a 250-mg amount of talampicillin, possibly due to their different stability in the digestive juices.
19131519	Sulfation of o-demethyl apixaban: enzyme identification and species comparison. Apixaban, a potent and highly selective factor Xa inhibitor, is currently under development for treatment of arterial and venous thrombotic diseases. The O-demethyl apixaban sulfate is a major circulating metabolite in humans but circulates at lower concentrations relative to parent in animals. The aim of this study was to identify the sulfotransferases (SULTs) responsible for the sulfation reaction. Apixaban undergoes O-demethylation catalyzed by cytochrome P450 enzymes to O-demethyl apixaban, and then is conjugated by SULTs to form O-demethyl apixaban sulfate. Of the five human cDNA-expressed SULTs tested, SULT1A1 and SULT1A2 exhibited significant levels of catalytic activity for formation of O-demethyl apixaban sulfate, and SULT1A3, SULT1E1, and SULT2A1 showed much lower catalytic activities. In human liver S9, quercetin, a highly selective inhibitor of SULT1A1 and SULT1E1, inhibited O-demethyl apixaban sulfate formation by 99%; 2,6-dichloro-4-nitrophenol, another inhibitor of SULT1A1, also inhibited this reaction by >90%; estrone, a competitive inhibitor for SULT1E1, had no effect on this reaction. The comparable K(m) values for formation of O-demethyl apixaban sulfate were 41.4 microM (human liver S9), 36.8 microM (SULT1A1), and 70.8 microM (SULT1A2). Because of the high level of expression of SULT1A1 in liver and its higher level of catalytic activity for formation of O-demethyl apixaban sulfate, SULT1A1 might play a major role in humans for formation of O-demethyl apixaban sulfate. O-Demethyl apixaban was also investigated in liver S9 of mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, monkeys, and humans. The results indicated that liver S9 samples from dogs, monkeys, and humans had higher activities for formation of O-demethyl apixaban sulfate than those of mice, rats, and rabbits.
16782768	3,4-Dehydrodebrisoquine, a novel debrisoquine metabolite formed from 4-hydroxydebrisoquine that affects the CYP2D6 metabolic ratio. Considerable unexplained intersubject variability in the debrisoquine metabolic ratio (urinary debrisoquine/4-hydroxydebrisoquine) exists within individual CYP2D6 genotypes. We speculated that debrisoquine was converted to as yet undisclosed metabolites. Thirteen healthy young volunteers, nine CYP2D6*1 homozygotes [extensive metabolizers (EMs)] and four CYP2D6*4 homozygotes [poor metabolizers (PMs)] took 12.8 mg of debrisoquine hemisulfate by mouth and collected 0- to 8- and 8- to 24-h urines, which were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) before and after treatment with beta-glucuronidase. Authentic 3,4-dehydrodebrisoquine was synthesized and characterized by GCMS, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and (1)H NMR. 3,4-Dehydrodebrisoquine is a novel metabolite of debrisoquine excreted variably in 0- to 24-h urine, both in EMs (3.1-27.6% of dose) and PMs (0-2.1% of dose). This metabolite is produced from 4-hydroxydebrisoquine in vitro by human and rat liver microsomes. A previously unstudied CYP2D6*1 homozygote was administered 10.2 mg of 4-hydroxydebrisoquine orally and also excreted 3,4-dehydrodebrisoquine. EMs excreted 6-hydroxydebrisoquine (0-4.8%) and 8-hydroxydebrisoquine (0-1.3%), but these phenolic metabolites were not detected in PM urine. Debrisoquine and 4-hydroxydebrisoquine glucuronides were excreted in a highly genotype-dependent manner. A microsomal activity that probably does not involve cytochrome P450 participates in the further metabolism of 4-hydroxydebrisoquine, which we speculate may also lead to the formation of 1- and 3-hydroxydebrisoquine and their ring-opened products. In conclusion, this study suggests that the traditional metabolic ratio is not a true measure of the debrisoquine 4-hydroxylation capacity of an individual and thus may, in part, explain the wide intragenotype variation in metabolic ratio.
21602311	A single dose mass balance study of the Hedgehog pathway inhibitor vismodegib (GDC-0449) in humans using accelerator mass spectrometry. Vismodegib (GDC-0449), a small-molecule Hedgehog pathway inhibitor, was well tolerated in patients with solid tumors and showed promising efficacy in advanced basal cell carcinoma in a Phase I trial. The purpose of the study presented here was to determine routes of elimination and the extent of vismodegib metabolism, including assessment and identification of metabolites in plasma, urine, and feces. Six healthy female subjects of nonchildbearing potential were enrolled; each received a single 30-ml oral suspension containing 150 mg of vismodegib with 6.5 μg of [(14)C]vismodegib to yield a radioactivity dose of approximately 37 kBq (1000 nCi). Plasma, urine, and feces samples were collected over 56 days to permit sample collection for up to 5 elimination half-lives. Nonradioactive vismodegib was measured in plasma using liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometry, and total radioactivity in plasma, urine, and feces was measured using accelerator mass spectrometry. Vismodegib was slowly eliminated by a combination of metabolism and excretion of parent drug, most of which was recovered in feces. The estimated excretion of the administered dose was 86.6% on average, with 82.2 and 4.43% recovered in feces and urine, respectively. Vismodegib was predominant in plasma, with concentrations representing >98% of the total circulating drug-related components. Metabolic pathways of vismodegib in humans included oxidation, glucuronidation, and uncommon pyridine ring cleavage. We conclude that vismodegib and any associated metabolic products are mainly eliminated through feces after oral administration in healthy volunteers.
17403996	Antiviral and cellular metabolism interactions between Dexelvucitabine and lamivudine. Studies on cellular drug interactions with antiretroviral agents prior to clinical trials are critical to detect possible drug interactions. Herein, we demonstrated that two 2'-deoxycytidine antiretroviral agents, dexelvucitabine (known as beta-d-2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluorocytidine, DFC, d-d4FC, or RVT) and lamivudine (3TC), combined in primary human peripheral blood mononuclear (PBM) cells infected with human immunodeficiency virus 1 strain LAI (HIV-1(LAI)), resulted in additive-to-synergistic effects. The cellular metabolism of DFC and 3TC was studied in human T-cell lymphoma (CEM) and in primary human PBM cells to determine whether this combination caused any reduction in active nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) levels, which could decrease with their antiviral potency. Competition studies were conducted by coincubation of either radiolabeled DFC with different concentrations of 3TC or radiolabeled 3TC with different concentrations of DFC. Coincubation of radiolabeled 3TC with DFC at concentrations up to 33.3 microM did not cause any marked reduction in 3TC-triphosphate (TP) or any 3TC metabolites. However, a reduction in the level of DFC metabolites was noted at high concentrations of 3TC with radiolabeled DFC. DFC-TP levels in CEM and primary human PBM cells decreased by 88% and 94%, respectively, when high concentrations of 3TC (33.3 and 100 microM) were added, which may influence the effectiveness of DFC-5'-TP on the HIV-1 polymerase. The NTP levels remained well above the median (50%) inhibitory concentration for HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. These results suggest that both beta-d- and beta-l-2'-deoxycytidine analogs, DFC and 3TC, respectively, substrates of 2'-deoxycytidine kinase, could be used in a combined therapeutic modality. However, it may be necessary to decrease the dose of 3TC for this combination to prove effective.
12893525	Species and gender differences in the formation of an active metabolite of a substituted 2,4-thiazolidinedione insulin sensitizer. 1. The metabolism of a substituted 2,4-thiazolidinedione (P1) with dual PPARalpha/gamma activity was evaluated in male and female rats, dogs and monkeys. A para-hydroxylated metabolite (M1) with potent PPARgamma-selective agonist, was a major circulating drug-related component in female rats, dogs and monkeys, but not in male rats (M1-to-P1 exposure ratio of <1, 3-5, 5 and 5-11 in male rat, monkey, female rat, and dog, respectively). 2. M1 (%) formed in vitro (5, 53, 57-65, 67 and 67% in male rat, monkey, female rat, dog, and human liver microsomes, respectively), rank ordered with M1 (%) formed in vivo (24-45, 53-57, 78, 75-85%, for male rat, monkey, female rat and dog, respectively, after oral administration of P1). 3. The plasma clearance of M1 was higher in male rats (32 ml min(-1) kg(-1) compared with 6, 7 and 2 ml min(-1) kg(-1) in female rat, male monkey and male dogs, respectively). 4. The low amounts of M1 observed in male rats, with the appearance of products of the cleavage of the propyl group between the phenyl groups was probably due to the presence of the sex-specific CYP2C11, which cleaves P1 at the propyl bridge. None of the CYPs present in female rats cleaved P1 at this site and M1 was only produced by CYP2C6. In humans, only CYP2C8 and the polymorphic CYP2C19 produced M1.
15129551	The metabolic rate constants and specific activity of human and rat hepatic cytochrome P-450 2E1 toward toluene and chloroform. Chloroform (CHCl3) is a near-ubiquitous environmental contaminant, a by-product of the disinfection of drinking water sources and a commercially important compound. Standards for safe exposure have been established based on information defining its toxicity, which is mediated by metabolites. The metabolism of CHCl3 is via cytochrome P-450 2E1 (CYP2E1)-mediated oxidation to phosgene, which is known to obey a saturable mechanism. CYP2E1 is a highly conserved form, expressed in all mammalian systems studied, and is responsible for the metabolism of a great many low-molecular-weight (halogenated) compounds. However, the Michaelis-Menten rate constants for CHCl3 oxidation have not been derived in vitro, and the specific activity of CYP2E1 toward CHCl3 has not been reported. In this investigation with microsomal protein (MSP), apparent Vmax values of 27.6 and 28.3 nmol/h/mg MSP and apparent K(m) values of 1 and 0.15 microM in rats and human organ donors, respectively, were demonstrated. The specific activity of CYP2E1 toward CHCl3 in rats and humans was 5.29 and 5.24 pmol/min/pmol CYP2E1, respectively. Toluene metabolism to benzyl alcohol (BA), another CYP2E1-dependent reaction, was also highly dependent on CYP2E1 content in humans, and was more efficient than was CHCl3 metabolism. The specific activity of human CYP2E1 toward toluene metabolism in human MSP was 23 pmol/min/pmol CYP2E1. These results demonstrate that differences in CYP2E1 content of MSP among individuals and between species are largely responsible for observed differences in toluene and CHCl3 metabolism in vitro.
23777616	Comparative metabolism study of β-lapachone in mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human liver microsomes using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. β-Lapachone (3,4-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-2H-naphthol[1,2-b]pyran-5,6-dione) is a natural compound extracted from the bark of the lapacho tree (Tabebuia avellanedae) and is undergoing phase II clinical trials as an antitumor drug candidate. The present study characterized in vitro metabolites of β-lapachone in mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human liver microsomes. β-Lapachone (10 μM) was incubated with mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human liver microsomes in the presence of NADPH. The reaction mixtures were analyzed by LC/MS and the metabolites were identified based on their elemental composition and product ion spectra. A total of 6 metabolites (M1-M6) were detected in liver microsomes with a slight difference between species. M1 and M6 were identified as a decarbonated metabolite and a carboxylated metabolite, respectively; M2, M3, and M4 were identified as monohydroxylated metabolites; and M5 was identified as an O-methylated metabolite. M5, an O-methylated metabolite was found in rat and human liver microsomes, which is thought to be formed from a catechol intermediate by MB-COMT-mediated methylation and reported here for the first time.
9302	Gastrointestinal absorption and metabolism of two 35S-labelled ampicillin esters. Two ampicillin esters, 35S-pivampicillin and 35S-carampicillin and polyethylene glycol (nonabsorbable marker) were given orally to healthy subjects with gastrointestinal tubes. The cumulative absorption of radioactivity in both compounds (60-90%) was higher than (25-67%) previously found after administration of 35S-ampicillin. The pek plasma levels of radioactivity were reached earlier and were about twice as high as in the latter study. The amount of radioactivity excreted in urine was about the same as that absorbed from the proximal part of the gastrointestinal tract. Both 35S-pivampicillin and 35S-carampicillin were partly hydrolyzed in the stomach and upper small intestine and labelled ampicillin was released. They were also decomposed after absorption since all the radioactivity recovered from blood and urine appeared to be attached to ampicillin and ampicillin metabolites. Studies in vitro indicated that ampicillin esters absorbed intact may be hydrolyzed not only in the blood but also in the intestinal wall and the liver.
21443919	Ochratoxin A and its metabolite ochratoxin alpha in urine and assessment of the exposure of inhabitants of Lleida, Spain. Ochratoxin A (OTA) as well as its metabolite ochratoxin α (OTα) were detected in human urine in order to assess the exposure to OTA of a group of 72 adult inhabitants of the city of Lleida (Spain). Urine samples were enzymatically treated; OTA and OTα were separated by liquid-liquid extraction, and detected by HPLC-fluorescence. Exposure to OTA was also evaluated by the estimation of its daily intake from food contamination data from the literature and from food consumption data provided by the participants, who filled in a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and a three-day food consumption record (3DR). OTA occurrence (12.5%, limit of detection=0.034 ng/mL) was lower than OTα occurrence (61.1%, limit of detection=0.023 ng/mL). The range of concentrations was 0.057-0.562 ng/mL and 0.056-2.894 ng/mL for OTA and for OTα, respectively. It could be observed for positive samples that the FFQ data were related to the OTA concentration in urine, whereas the 3DR data were related to the OTα levels in urine. The OTA estimated daily intake of the participants was lower than 30% of the latest provisional tolerable daily intake of 14 ng/kg body weight/day in the worst cases of exposure.
39132	The distribution of amylobarbitone, butobarbitone, pentobarbitone and quinalbarbitone and the hydroxylated metabolites in man. Fluid and tissue specimens collected from 30 subjects at autopsy have been assayed for their content of common sedative barbiturates and the corresponding hydroxylated metabolites by g.l.c. Where one barbiturate had been ingested an inverse relationship between lipid solubility of the drug and the distribution in fluids and tissues was observed. In most cases the liver, and in the remainder the spleen, contained the highest concentrations of barbiturate. Bile concentrations were often in excess of those in the corresponding liver. The metabolites of the four sedative barbiturates were usually present in lower amounts than the parent drugs in the fluids and tissues of most subjects but urine often contained much higher concentrations of metabolites--sometimes exceeding that of the parent drug in the liver. Administration of two or more barbiturates together did not appear to affect the distribution and metabolism of the individual drugs.
16713261	Identification of metabolites of the tryptase inhibitor CRA-9249: observation of a metabolite derived from an unexpected hydroxylation pathway. The metabolites of the tryptase inhibitor CRA-9249 were identified after exposure to liver microsomes. CRA-9249 was found to be degraded rapidly in liver microsomes from rabbit, dog, cynomolgus monkey, and human, and less rapidly in microsomes from rat. The key metabolites included cleavage of an aryl ether, in addition to an unexpected hydroxylation of the amide side chain adjacent to the amide nitrogen. The chemical structures of both metabolites were confirmed by synthesis and comparison to material isolated from the liver microsomes. Several suspected hydroxylated metabolites were also synthesized and analyzed as part of the structure identification process.
18571483	Validated LC-MS/MS methods for the determination of risperidone and the enantiomers of 9-hydroxyrisperidone in human plasma and urine. Two liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods are described, one for the quantitative determination of risperidone and the enantiomers of its active metabolite 9-hydroxyrisperidone (paliperidone) in human plasma and the other for the determination of the enantiomers of 9-hydroxyrisperidone in human urine. The plasma method is based on solid-phase extraction of 200 microl of sample on a mixed-mode sorbent, followed by separation on a cellulose-based LC column with a 13.5-min mobile phase gradient of hexane, isopropanol and ethanol. After post-column addition of 10 mM ammonium acetate in ethanol/water, detection takes place by ion-spray tandem mass spectrometry in the positive ion mode. Method validation results show that the method is sufficiently selective towards the enantiomers of 7-hydroxyrisperidone and capable of quantifying the analytes with good precision and accuracy in the concentration range of 0.2-100 ng/ml. An accelerated (run time of 4.3 min) and equally valid method for the enantiomers of 9-hydroxyrisperidone alone in plasma is obtained by increasing the mobile phase flow-rate from 1.0 to 2.0 ml/min and slightly adapting the gradient conditions. The urine method is based on the same solid-phase extraction and chromatographic approach as the accelerated plasma method. Using 100 microl of sample, (+)- and (-)-9-hydroxyrisperidone can be quantified in the concentration range 1-2000 ng/ml. The accelerated method for plasma and the method for urine can be used only when paliperidone is administered instead of risperidone, as there is insufficient separation of the 9-hydroxy enantiomers from the 7-hydroxy enantiomers, the latter ones being present only after risperidone administration.
12846597	Ximelagatran, an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, has a low potential for cytochrome P450-mediated drug-drug interactions. Ximelagatran is an oral direct thrombin inhibitor currently in clinical development for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders. After oral administration, ximelagatran is rapidly absorbed and extensively bioconverted, via two intermediates (ethyl-melagatran and hydroxy-melagatran), to its active form, melagatran. In vitro studies have shown no evidence for involvement of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in either the bioactivation or the elimination of melagatran. To investigate the potential of ximelagatran, the intermediates ethyl-melagatran and hydroxy-melagatran, and melagatran to inhibit the CYP system in vitro and in vivo, and the influence of three CYP substrates on the pharmacokinetics of melagatran in vivo. The CYP inhibitory properties of ximelagatran, the intermediates and melagatran were tested in vitro by two different methods, using heterologously expressed enzymes or human liver microsomes. Diclofenac (CYP2C9), diazepam (CYP2C19) and nifedipine (CYP3A4) were chosen for coadministration with ximelagatran in healthy volunteers. Subjects received oral ximelagatran 24mg and/or diclofenac 50mg, a 10-minute intravenous infusion of diazepam 0.1 mg/kg, or nifedipine 60mg. The plasma pharmacokinetics of melagatran, diclofenac, diazepam, N-desmethyl-diazepam and nifedipine were determined when administered alone and in combination with ximelagatran. No inhibition, or only minor inhibition, of CYP enzymes by ximelagatran, the intermediates or melagatran was shown in the in vitro studies, suggesting that ximelagatran would not cause CYP-mediated drug-drug interactions in vivo. This result was confirmed in the clinical studies. There were no statistically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac, diazepam and nifedipine on coadministration with ximelagatran. Moreover, there were no statistically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of melagatran when ximelagatran was administered alone or in combination with diclofenac, diazepam or nifedipine. As ximelagatran did not exert a significant effect on the hepatic CYP isoenzymes responsible for the metabolism of diclofenac, diazepam and nifedipine, it is reasonable to expect that it would have no effect on the metabolism of other drugs metabolised by these isoenzymes. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetics of melagatran after oral administration of ximelagatran are not expected to be altered by inhibition or induction of CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP3A4. Together, the in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that metabolic drug-drug interactions involving the major human CYP enzymes should not be expected with ximelagatran.
17620343	Mechanism-based inactivation of cytochrome P450 2A6 by decursinol angelate isolated from Angelica Gigas. The inhibition of CYP2A6 by decursinol angelate, a pyranocoumarin isolated from Angelica gigas roots, was examined in human liver microsomes and recombinant CYP2A6. Decursinol angelate moderately inhibited coumarin 7-hydroxylation, but a 20-min preincubation with microsomes and NADPH significantly increased its inhibitory effect (IC(50); >20 versus 4.4 microM). A similar inhibition pattern was observed in nicotine C oxidation, which is also one of the prototype reactions of CYP2A6. Inactivation by decursinol angelate was selective for CYP2A6 and characterized by K(I) values of 0.99 and 2.42 microM and the k(inact) values of 0.136 and 0.053 min(-1) in microsomes and recombinant CYP2A6, respectively. This inactivation was not protected or restored by nucleophiles, reactive oxygen scavengers, or extensive dialysis but was inhibited by the addition of a competitive CYP2A6 inhibitor, pilocarpine. Furthermore, incubation of CYP2A6 with decursinol angelate in the presence of NADPH resulted in a loss of the spectral CYP2A6 content. An in vitro metabolism study revealed that CYP2A6 oxidized decursinol angelate to the dihydrodiol metabolite, presumably via an epoxide intermediate that might be responsible for the inactivation of CYP2A6. These results collectively demonstrated that decursinol angelate inactivated CYP2A6 in a mechanism-based mode.
20073472	Development of a hydrophilic liquid interaction chromatography-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry based stable isotope dilution analysis and pharmacokinetic studies on bioactive pyridines in human plasma and urine after coffee consumption. The paper reports on the development of an accurate hydrophilic liquid interaction chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS/MS) based stable isotope dilution analysis for the simultaneous quantitation of the food-derived bioactive pyridines trigonelline, nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, and N-methylpyridinium, as well as their key metabolites nicotinamide-N-oxide, N-methylnicotinamide, N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide, N-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide, and N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxylic acid in human plasma and urine. Precision of the stable isotope dilution analysis (SIDA) was 1.9% and 11.9% relative standard deviation (n = 6), and accuracy was between 92.4% and 113.0%. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) was 50 fmol (10 pmol/mL) injected onto the column for all analytes with the exception of N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxylic acid and N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide, for which an LLOQ of 100 fmol (20 pmol/mL) was found. The method was applied to monitor the plasma appearance and urinary excretion and to determine pharmacokinetic parameters of the bioactive pyridines as well as their metabolites in a clinical human intervention study with healthy volunteers (six women, seven men) after oral administration of 350 mL of a standard coffee beverage. Trigonelline plasma levels increased from 160 nmol/L to maximum concentrations of 5479 (males) or 6547 nmol/L (females), and N-methylpyridinium plasma levels raised from virtually complete absence to maximum values of 777 (females) or 804 nmol/L (males) within 2-3 and 1-2 h after coffee consumption, respectively. The high plasma levels of N-methylpyridinium found after coffee consumption clearly demonstrate for the first time that this cation is entering the vascular system, which is the prerequisite for biological in vivo effects claimed for that compound. In contrast, the coffee intervention did not significantly influence the plasma concentrations of N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide and N-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide, the major niacin metabolites. Within 8 h after coffee intervention, an urinary excretion of 57.4 +/- 6.9% of trigonelline and 69.1 +/- 6.2% of N-methylpyridinium was found for the male volunteers, whereas females excreted slightly less with 46.2 +/- 7.4% and 61.9 +/- 12.2% of these pyridines.
17219606	Detection of Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid A in human urine and blood serum by LC-MS/MS. Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid A (Delta9-THCA-A) is the precursor of Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta9-THC) in hemp plants. During smoking, the non-psychoactive Delta9-THCA-A is converted to Delta9-THC, the main psychoactive component of marihuana and hashish. Although the decarboxylation of Delta9-THCA-A to Delta9-THC was assumed to be complete--which means that no Delta9-THCA-A should be detectable in urine and blood serum of cannabis consumers--we found Delta9-THCA-A in the urine and blood serum samples collected from police controls of drivers suspected for driving under the influence of drugs (DUID). For LC-MS/MS analysis, urine and blood serum samples were prepared by solid-phase extraction. Analysis was performed with a phenylhexyl column using gradient elution with acetonitrile. For detection of Delta9-THCA-A, the mass spectrometer (MS) (SCIEX API 365 triple-quadrupole MS with TurboIonSpray source) was operated in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode using the following transitions: m/z357 --> 313, m/z357 --> 245 and m/z357 --> 191. Delta9-THCA-A could be detected in the urine and blood serum samples of several cannabis consumers in concentrations of up to 10.8 ng/ml in urine and 14.8 ng/ml in serum. The concentration of Delta9-THCA-A was below the Delta9-THC concentration in most serum samples, resulting in molar ratios of Delta9-THCA-A/Delta9-THC of approximately 5.0-18.6%. Only in one case, where a short elapsed time between the last intake and blood sampling is assumed, the molar ratio was 18.6% in the serum. This indicates differences in elimination kinetics, which need to be investigated in detail.
7875181	Interindividual variability of coumarin 7-hydroxylation in a Turkish population. One hundred healthy Turkish volunteers (70 male, 30 female) aged from 19 to 56 years were given 5 mg coumarin p.o. after an overnight fast. Urine samples were collected before and 2, 4 and 8 h after drug administration. The extent and rate of formation of 7-OH-coumarin (7OHC) was determined by the urinary excretion of the metabolite as measured with the fluorometric method. On average, 80% of 7OHC formed was excreted in 2 h. The total amount of 7OHC formed was 59.8% (21.5%) (mean and SD, n = 100, range 17-100%) of the given dose. The percentage of 7OHC excreted during the first 2 h compared with the 7OHC excretion at 8 h was a constant and stable individual characteristic for the rate of the formation of 7OHC ('2 h coumarin test'). Although four individuals had relatively slow coumarin test values (34-40%), no clear-cut polymorphism in the rate of 7OHC formation was found. However, 7OHC formation was lower in males and in cigarette smokers.
11504277	A comparative multidose pharmacokinetic study of buspirone extended-release tablets with a reference immediate-release product. Buspirone is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,717,634 as a pharmaceutically active compound that has been found to be effective for the treatment of anxiety disorders and depression. In this randomized, two-treatment, two-period, multidose crossover study, the pharmacokinetics of a once-daily extended-release (ER)formulation of buspirone was compared with that of an immediate-release (IR) formulation of commercially available buspirone. A total of 30 mg of the ER formulation was administered to 36 healthy volunteers once daily for 7 days, and 15 mg of the IR formulation was administered twice daily for 7 days. Pharmacokinetic profiles of buspirone and its metabolite, 1-pyrimidinylpiperazine (1-PP), were obtained at steady state. The bioavailability of buspirone from the ER formulation was more than three times higher than that from the IR formulation at steady state, and that of 1-PP was about 25% less. The mean steady-state Cmax of buspirone from the ER formulation was 46% higher than that from the IR formulation (p < 0.05), and that for 1-PP was lower by 29% (p < 0.05). The mean apparent half-life of buspirone from the ER formulation (9.04 hours) was considerably longer than that observed for the IR formulation (3.06 hours). The median 1-PP/buspirone AUC ratio was much higher for the IR formulation at steady state (24.4) than for the ER formulation (6.44). There were no significant differences in average pharmacokinetic metrics observed in men and women. Based on these observations of the potential benefits of once-daily dosing with the ER product in terms of prolonged buspirone plasma concentrations, a significant increase in the ratio of buspirone to 1-PP concentration with a lower intersubject variation could be achieved that should provide an improvement in the desired therapeutic effects of buspirone.
12186421	Effect of probucol on cytochrome P450 activities in human liver microsomes. The effects of probucol, a cholesterol-lowering agent, on several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoform-specific reactions in human liver microsomes were investigated to predict drug interactions with probucol in vivo from in vitro data. The following eight CYP catalytic reactions were used in this study: CYP1A1/2-mediated 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation, CYP2A6-mediated coumarin 7-hydroxylation, CYP2B6-mediated 7-benzyloxyresorufin O-debenzylation, CYP2C8/9-mediated tolbutamide methylhydroxylation, CYP2C19-mediated S-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation, CYP2D6-mediated bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation, CYP2E1-mediated chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylation, and CYP3A4-mediated testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation. Probucol had neither stimulatory nor inhibitory effects on CYP1Al/2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8/9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4 activities at concentrations up to 300 microM, indicating that probucol, at the expected therapeutic concentrations, would not be predicted to cause clinically significant interactions with other CYP-metabolized drugs.
15637092	Modulation of the metabolism and adverse effects of benzo[a]pyrene by a specific antibody: a novel host factor in environmental carcinogenesis? The influence of specific antibodies on molecular and cellular mechanisms of activation, detoxification and biological activity of the ubiquitous carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) was investigated using a monoclonal antibody. The antibody was shown to decrease cellular uptake and metabolic activation of B[a]P as demonstrated by higher recovery of unmetabolized B[a]P and decreased formation of end-point phenol metabolites in two types of target cells. Furthermore, strong antibody reactivity with 7,8-diol-B[a]P provided a second chance for interrupting metabolic activation by sequestration of this intermediate metabolite in the extracellular space. The biological relevance of B[a]P and 7,8-diol-B[a]P redistribution by antibody was demonstrated by reversion of B[a]P-induced inhibition of proliferation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and by inhibition of CYP 1A1 induction in HepG2 cells. Remarkably, the antibody was still protective against B[a]P-induced immunotoxicity even after delayed addition, suggesting a more important role of metabolites in immunotoxicity than has been appreciated so far. Although B[a]P is activated to 7,8-diol-B[a]P in the same cells that are inhibited by this metabolite, the antibody completely restored lymphocyte proliferation indicating that extracellular trapping of the 7,8-diol-B[a]P is biologically highly effective. Thus, repartitioning of both B[a]P and its metabolites by the antibody may reduce their effective concentration in susceptible target organs and therefore relieve overloaded DNA repair mechanisms and inhibit carcinogen-induced P450 induction. These in vitro data also suggest that a natural or prophylactic antibody response against carcinogens may be associated with a reduced risk of cancer.
12745870	Determination of the human cytochrome P450s involved in the metabolism of 2n-propylquinoline. 1 2n-Propylquinoline (2nPQ) is a newly developed drug for visceral antileishmaniasis and its activity has been previously evaluated in mice following oral administration. The study was carried out to investigate the kinetic formation of 2nPQ metabolites and to characterize the human liver CYP forms involved in its oxidative metabolism. 2. The inhibition of 2nPQ metabolite formation by specific substrates or inhibitors of CYP forms and correlation studies were performed in human liver microsomes. 2nPQ biotransformation was then studied in human lymphoblasts expressing specific CYPs and microsomal epoxide hydrolase. 3. Three major metabolites were produced by human liver microsomes and their structures were identified by ESI-LC/MS: dihydroxy-2n-propylquinoline, 3'-hydroxy-2n-propylquinoline and 1'-hydroxy-2n-propylquinoline. An intermediary metabolite, epoxy-2n-propylquinoline, formed by CYP was also biotransformed by microsomal epoxide hydrolase into dihydroxy-2n-propylquinoline. 4. 2nPQ oxidation follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics. In human liver microsomes, its metabolism was extremely inhibited by pilocarpine, coumarin and diethyldithiocarbamate. From a panel of 12 human liver microsome samples, the rate of 2nPQ oxidation was highly correlated with the activities of CYP2A6 and CYP2E1. Human lymphoblasts expressing specific CYPs showed the involvement of CYP2A6, CYP2E1 and CYP2C19. 5. The results indicate that 2nPQ metabolites are 3'- and 1'-hydroxylated by human liver microsomes and an epoxy-2n-propylquinoline is biotransformed into a dihydroxy-2n-propylquinoline by microsomal epoxide hydrolase.
12695354	Characterization of in vitro biotransformation of new, orally active, direct thrombin inhibitor ximelagatran, an amidoxime and ester prodrug. N-Hydroxylated amidines (amidoximes) can be used as prodrugs of amidines. The prodrug principle was developed in our laboratory for pentamidine and had been applied to several other drug candidates. One of these compounds is melagatran, a novel, synthetic, low molecular weight, direct thrombin inhibitor. To increase the poor oral bioavailability due to its strong basic amidine functionality selected to fit the arginine side pocket of thrombin, the less basic N-hydroxylated amidine was used in addition to an ethyl ester-protecting residue. The objective of this investigation was to study the reduction and the hydrolytic metabolism of ximelagatran via two mono-prodrugs (N-hydroxy-melagatran and ethyl-melagatran) to melagatran by in vitro experiments. New high-performance liquid chromatography methods were developed to analyze all four compounds. The biotransformation of ximelagatran to melagatran involving the reduction of the amidoxime function and the ester cleavage could be demonstrated in vitro by microsomes and mitochondria from liver and kidney of pig and human, and the kinetic parameters were determined. So far, one enzyme system capable of reducing N-hydroxylated structures has been identified in pig liver microsomes, consisting of cytochrome b(5), NADH-cytochrome b(5) reductase, and a P450 isoenzyme of the subfamily 2D. This enzyme system also reduces ximelagatran and N-hydroxy-melagatran. The participation of recombinant human CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4 with cytochrome b(5) and b(5) reductase in the reduction can be excluded. In summary, ximelagatran and N-hydroxy-melagatran are easily reduced by several enzyme systems located in microsomes and mitochondria of different organs.
19270786	Medications as a potential source of exposure to phthalates in the U.S. population. Widespread human exposure to phthalates, some of which are developmental and reproductive toxicants in experimental animals, raises concerns about potential human health risks. Underappreciated sources of exposure include phthalates in the polymers coating some oral medications. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether users of phthalate-containing medications have higher urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites than do nonusers. We used publically available files from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for the years 1999-2004. For certain survey periods, participants were asked to recall use of prescription medication during the past 30 days, and for a subsample of individuals, the urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites were measured. We a priori identified medications potentially containing phthalates as inactive ingredients and then compared the mean urinary concentration of phthalate metabolites between users and nonusers of those medications. Of the 7,999 persons with information on urinary phthalate concentrations, 6 reported using mesalamine formulations, some of which may include dibutyl phthalate (DBP); the mean urinary concentration of monobutyl phthalate, the main DBP metabolite, among these mesalamine users was 50 times higher than the mean for nonusers (2,257 microg/L vs. 46 microg/L; p < 0.0001). Users of didanosine, omeprazole, and theophylline products, some of which may contain diethyl phthalate (DEP), had mean urinary concentrations of monoethyl phthalate, the main DEP metabolite, significantly higher than the mean for nonusers. Select medications might be a source of high exposure to some phthalates, one of which, DBP, shows adverse developmental and reproductive effects in laboratory animals. These results raise concern about potential human health risks, specifically among vulnerable segments of the general population and particularly pregnant women and children.
15282755	Quantitative analysis of 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors in DU145 cells using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. N-(Dicyclohexyl)acetylpiperidine-4-benzylidene-4-carboxylic acid (1) is an excellent in vitro inhibitor of 5 alpha-reductase (5 alpha R). Compound 1 showed, however, much lower inhibition activity of 5 alpha R in vivo than in vitro, which might be caused by poor membrane permeability. The methyl ester of 1 (1a) was therefore tested as a model prodrug to see if it has better permeability properties than the corresponding acid 1. It was also monitored that this methyl ester was cleaved into the active compound 1 within the DU145 cells. Quantitative matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS) and high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS/MS) methods were established with reliable linearity factors (0.996 for MALDI-TOFMS and 0.998 for HPLC/MS/MS) and reproducibility (relative standard deviation = 6.5% for MALDI-TOFMS and 2.8% for HPLC/MS/MS). The samples for MS analysis were effectively prepared from the cell homogenates using solid-phase extraction, with a high recovery of 90% on average. The intracellular amount of 1a (1.7 nmol) was much higher than that of 1 (0.032 nmol) in DU145 cells after 6 h of incubation. After incubation with the ester (1a), the cleaved acid (1) was detected within the cells. The concentration of acid 1 (0.045 nmol) in this experiment was higher than the acid content (0.032 nmol) after direct incubation with 1. Surprisingly, high amounts of the cleaved compound 1 were found outside the cells after 6 h of incubation with 1a.
1683073	Pharmacokinetics and biotransformation of the anxiolytic abecarnil in healthy volunteers. 1. The pharmacokinetics of abecarnil were studied in eight healthy male volunteers using 14C-abecarnil and an h.p.l.c. method for determination of unchanged drug. 2. Abecarnil was rapidly and nearly completely absorbed after an oral dose of 10 mg; bioavailability was 40%. Plasma levels of the unchanged drug declined with a terminal half-life of 4 h. The total clearance of abecarnil was 11 ml/min per kg. 14C-Abecarnil was excreted rapidly and completely. The main route of elimination was in the faeces. 3. Abecarnil was extensively metabolized resulting in ether cleavage at position 6 with subsequent glucuronidation or sulphation and, to a minor extent, in ester cleavage.
21859392	Flavin monooxygenases, FMO1 and FMO3, not cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, contribute to metabolism of anti-tumour triazoloacridinone, C-1305, in liver microsomes and HepG2 cells. 5-Dimethylaminopropylamino-8-hydroxytriazoloacridinone, C-1305, being the close structural analogue of the clinically tested imidazoacridinone anti-tumour agent, C-1311, expressed high activity against experimental tumours and is expected to have more advantageous pharmacological properties than C-1311. The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of selected liver enzymes in the metabolism of C-1305. We demonstrated that the studied triazoloacridinone was transformed with rat and human liver microsomes, HepG2 hepatoma cells and with human recombinant flavin-containing monooxygenases FMO1, FMO3 but not with CYPs. Furthermore, this compound was an effective inhibitor of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. The product of FMO catalysed metabolism was shown to be identical to the main metabolite from liver microsomes and HepG2 cells. It was identified as an N-oxide derivative and, under hypoxia, it underwent retroreduction back to C-1305, what was extremely effective with participation of CYP3A4. In summary, this work revealed that the involvement of the P450 enzymatic system in microsomal and cellular metabolism of C-1305 was negligible, whereas this agent was an inhibitor of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. In contrast, FMO1 and FMO3 were crucial for metabolism of C-1305 by liver microsomes and in HepG2 cells, which makes C-1305 an attractive potent anti-tumour agent.
15193727	Simultaneous determination of albendazole and its major active metabolite in human plasma using a sensitive and specific liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric method. A method for the simultaneous determination of albendazole (ABZ) and its major active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide (ABZ-SO) was developed and validated. The analytes were extracted from plasma samples by liquid-liquid extraction and analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with an electrospray ionization interface. Estazolam was used as the internal standard. The assay was linear in the concentration range 0.4-200 ng/ml for ABZ and 4.0-2000 ng/ml for ABZ-SO. The intra- and inter-run precision (R.S.D.), calculated from quality control (QC) samples was less than 7.1 and 9.4% for ABZ and ABZ-SO, respectively. The accuracy as determined from QC samples was within +/- 3% for the analytes. Recoveries of ABZ and ABZ-SO were greater than 77 and 53%, respectively, over the calibration curve range. The method developed was successfully applied to pharmacokinetic studies of ABZ and ABZ-SO after an oral dose of 400 mg albendazole to healthy volunteers.
2352161	Pharmacokinetics of falipamil after intravenous administration to humans. Falipamil (2-[3-[3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenetylmethylamino]propyl]-5,6- dimethoxyphthalamidine; 1) is a new specific bradycardic agent for the treatment of sinus tachycardia. Pharmacokinetics of falipamil in humans (n = 6) was determined in plasma and urine after iv administration of 100 mg (1.85 MBq) per person of 14C-labeled drug by liquid scintillation counting and by a specific, sensitive reversed-phase totally automated HPLC system with fluorimetric detection. Recovery of total radioactivity was 91.8 +/- 3.7%, with 68.2 +/- 4.3% in urine and 23.6 +/- 2.5% in the feces. The majority of radioactivity was excreted within 24 to 48 h. The parent drug, falipamil (1), and its N-desmethyl-metabolite (2), which is approximately 100 times less active than 1, contributed 14.1 +/- 1.6 and 4.5 +/- 0.7%, respectively, of the dose to urinary excretion. Plasma protein binding of 1 and 2 was 87.9 +/- 1.2 (concentration range: 2000-8000 ng/mL) and 89.7 +/- 0.5% (concentration range: 62.5-1000 ng/mL), respectively. Plasma concentrations of 1 peaked at 2 min at 724 +/- 173 ng/mL, declined biphasically, and were fitted to a two-compartment open model. Plasma concentrations of 2 were very low, in all cases ranging from 0 to 35 ng/mL. The dominant terminal half-life (beta-phase) of 1 from plasma was 1.8 +/- 0.6 h (range 1.4-2.9 h), mean residence time was 2.4 +/- 0.4 h, total body clearance was 1108.5 +/- 119 mL/min, and renal clearance was 117 +/- 20 mL/min. All parameters demonstrated very low intersubject variability.
12119000	Cytochrome P450 3A4-mediated bioactivation of raloxifene: irreversible enzyme inhibition and thiol adduct formation. Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator which is effective in the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. We report herein that cytochrome P450 (P450)3A4 is inhibited by raloxifene in human liver microsomal incubations. The nature of the inhibition was irreversible and was NADPH- and preincubation time-dependent, with K(I) and k(inact) values estimated at 9.9 microM and 0.16 min(-1), respectively. The observed loss of P450 3A4 activity was attenuated partially by glutathione (GSH), implying the involvement of a reactive metabolite(s) in the inactivation process. Subsequently, GSH adducts of raloxifene were identified in incubations with human liver microsomes; substitution with GSH occurred at the 5- or 7-position of the benzothiophene moiety or at the 3'-position of the phenol ring, with the 7-glutathionyl derivative being most abundant based on LC/MS and NMR analyses. These adducts are postulated to derive from addition of GSH to raloxifene arene oxides followed by dehydration and aromatization. Alternatively, raloxifene may be oxidized to an extended quinone intermediate, which then is trapped by GSH conjugation. The bioactivation of raloxifene most likely is catalyzed by P450 3A4, since the formation of GSH adducts was almost abolished when liver microsomes were pretreated with ketoconazole or with an inhibitory anti-P450 3A4 IgG. The GSH adducts also were detected in incubations of raloxifene with rat or human hepatocytes, while the corresponding N-acetylcysteine adducts were identified in the bile and urine from rats treated orally with the drug at 5 mg/kg. Taken together, these data indicate that P450 3A4-mediated bioactivation of raloxifene in vitro is accompanied by loss of enzyme activity. The significance of these findings with respect to the clinical use of raloxifene remains to be determined.
12398564	Pharmacokinetic interaction between nortriptyline and terbinafine. To clarify the mechanism of interaction between nortriptyline and terbinafine. Nortriptyline intoxication secondary to terbinafine treatment was observed in a woman with a major depressive disorder. This is the second report of this interaction. A rechallenge was performed during which serum concentrations were measured of nortriptyline and the 2 hydroxy metabolites. To document the case, genotyping of CYP2D6 was also performed. Metabolism by CYP2D6 is of major importance for the hydroxylation of nortriptyline, making it susceptible to competitive inhibition by terbinafine. The pharmacokinetic interaction between nortriptyline and terbinafine is probably due to inhibition of CYP2D6 of the nortriptyline metabolism by terbinafine. The interaction is not restricted to a subpopulation, but may occur even in persons without deviations in CYP2D6.
18006647	The metabolism and disposition of the oral direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, in humans. The pharmacokinetics and metabolism of the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran (BIBR 953 ZW, beta-alanine, N-[[2-[[[4-(aminoiminomethyl)phenyl]amino]methyl]-1-methyl-1H-benzimidazol-5-yl]carbonyl]-N-2-pyridinyl) were studied in 10 healthy males, who received 200 mg of [(14)C]dabigatran etexilate (BIBR 1048 MS, the oral prodrug of dabigatran) or an i.v. infusion of 5 mg of [(14)C]dabigatran. Radioactivity was measured in plasma, urine, and feces over 1 week. The metabolite pattern was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography with on-line radioactivity detection, and metabolite structures were elucidated by mass spectrometry. Dabigatran etexilate was rapidly converted to dabigatran, with peak plasma dabigatran concentrations being attained after approximately 1.5 h; the bioavailability of dabigatran after p.o. administration of dabigatran etexilate was 7.2%. Dabigatran was predominantly excreted in the feces after p.o. treatment and in the urine after i.v. treatment. The mean terminal half-life of dabigatran was approximately 8 h. The predominant metabolic reaction was esterase-mediated hydrolysis of dabigatran etexilate to dabigatran. Phase I metabolites accounted for <or=0.6% of the dose in urine and 5.8% of the dose in feces following p.o. administration and <or=1.5 and 0.2%, respectively, following i.v. administration. Dabigatran acylglucuronides accounted for 0.4 and 4% of the dose in urine after p.o. and i.v. dosing, respectively. In vitro experiments confirmed that dabigatran etexilate is metabolized primarily by esterases and that cytochrome P450 plays no relevant role. These findings suggest that pharmacologically active concentrations of dabigatran are readily achieved after p.o. administration of dabigatran etexilate and that the potential for clinically relevant interactions between dabigatran and drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 is low.
20006453	Buprenorphine and major metabolites in blood specimens collected for drug analysis in law enforcement purposes. A liquid chromatographic/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometric method for the quantification of buprenorphine (BUP), norbuprenorphine (NBUP), buprenorphine-3-beta-D-glucuronide (BUPG) and norbuprenorphine-3-beta-D-glucuronide (NBUPG) in serum samples was developed and validated. Pre-treatment of BUP and NBUP was by liquid-liquid extraction, while glucuronides were favourably isolated by solid phase extraction. Separation in 2 separate runs (2 x 5 min) was achieved using isocratic elution. The method was applied to 20 authentic serum specimens collected for law enforcement purposes where BUP intake had been indicated. The parent drug was not detectable in half of the specimens at a lower limit of detection of 0.2 ng/mL, whereas NBUP could be determined from any sample but one. NBUPG is the major metabolite present, which could be identified along with BUPG in all samples under investigation. In authentic specimens it could be advisable to monitor BUP metabolites along with the parent drug.
12754096	Evidence of covalent binding of the dietary flavonoid quercetin to DNA and protein in human intestinal and hepatic cells. Quercetin-rich foods have the potential to prevent human disease. However, knowledge of its biological fate and mechanism of action is limited. This study extends previous observations of the oxidation of quercetin by peroxidases to quinone/quinone methide intermediates and, for the first time, demonstrates covalent binding of [14C]quercetin to macromolecules. This was first demonstrated using horseradish peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide with human liver microsomal protein to trap the intermediates. To extend this observation to the cellular level, human intestinal Caco-2 cells and hepatic Hep G2 cells were incubated for up to 2hr with [14C]quercetin, and cellular DNA and protein were isolated. The cellular uptake of [14C]quercetin was rapid, and the covalent binding of [14C]quercetin to DNA and protein was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry after extensive purification. Both cell types demonstrated DNA binding with a maximum level of 5-15pmol/mg DNA. The level of covalent binding to protein was considerably higher in both cell types, 75-125pmol/mg protein. To determine potential specificity in the protein binding, Hep G2 cells were treated with [14C]quercetin, and the cell lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by staining and autoradiography. Several distinct radiolabeled protein bands did not correspond to the major Coomassie blue stained cellular proteins. We propose that this specific binding may mediate part of the antiproliferative and other cellular actions of quercetin.
17303175	Cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of tetrahydrocannabinols and cannabinol by human hepatic microsomes. In this study, tetrahydrocannabinols (THCs) were mainly oxidized at the 11-position and allylic sites at the 7alpha-position for Delta(8)-THC and the 8beta-position for Delta(9)-THC by human hepatic microsomes. Cannabinol (CBN) was also mainly metabolized to 11-hydroxy-CBN and 8-hydroxy-CBN by the microsomes. The 11-hydroxylation of three cannabinoids by the microsomes was markedly inhibited by sulfaphenazole, a selective inhibitor of CYP2C enzymes, while the hydroxylations at the 7alpha-(Delta(8)-THC), 8beta-(Delta(9)-THC) and 8-positions (CBN) of the corresponding cannabinoids were highly inhibited by ketoconazole, a selective inhibitor of CYP3A enzymes. Human CYP2C9-Arg expressed in the microsomes of human B lymphoblastoid cells efficiently catalyzed the 11-hydroxylation of Delta(8)-THC (7.60 nmol/min/nmol CYP), Delta(9)-THC (19.2 nmol/min/nmol CYP) and CBN (6.62 nmol/min/nmol CYP). Human CYP3A4 expressed in the cells catalyzed the 7alpha-(5.34 nmol/min/nmol CYP) and 7beta-hydroxylation (1.39 nmol/min/nmol CYP) of Delta(8)-THC, the 8beta-hydroxylation (6.10 nmol/min/nmol CYP) and 9alpha,10alpha-epoxidation (1.71 nmol/min/nmol CYP) of Delta(9)-THC, and the 8-hydroxylation of CBN (1.45 nmol/min/nmol CYP). These results indicate that CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 are major enzymes involved in the 11-hydroxylation and the 8-(or the 7-) hydroxylation, respectively, of the cannabinoids by human hepatic microsomes. In addition, CYP3A4 is a major enzyme responsible for the 7alpha- and 7beta-hydroxylation of Delta(8)-THC, and the 9alpha,10alpha-epoxidation of Delta(9)-THC.
17344341	Pharmacokinetics of ML3403 ({4-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-methylsulfanyl-3H-imidazol-4-yl]-pyridin-2-yl}-(1-phenylethyl)-amine), a 4-Pyridinylimidazole-type p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor. The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is a key mediator in cytokine-induced signaling events that are activated in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli such as stress factors, apoptosis, and proliferation. Therefore, the MAPK family plays an integral role in disease states including oncogenesis, autoimmune diseases, and inflammatory processes. Inhibition of these protein kinases represents an attractive strategy for therapeutic intervention. In particular, one class of p38 MAP kinase inhibitors, the pyridinyl imidazole derivatives, is intensely investigated by several industrial groups, but so far no studies concerning the metabolism of these structurally related substances seem to be available. The objective of our examinations was the preclinical characterization of ML3403, {4-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-methylsulfanyl-3H-imidazol-4-yl]-pyridin-2-yl}-(1-phenylethyl)-amine, a potent inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, comprising the basic pyridinyl imidazole structure. In human hepatic microsomal incubations, the sulfoxidation to ML3603 ({4-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-methylsulfinyl-3H-imidazol-4-yl]-pyridin-2-yl}-(1-phenylethyl)-amine) and M-sulfone ({4-[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-methylsulfonyl-3H-imidazol-4-yl]-pyridin-2-yl}-(1-phenylethyl)-amine) was found to be the predominant metabolic transformation. In addition, oxidative removal of the phenylethyl moiety, pyridine N-oxidation, and hydroxylation reactions were observed. Incubations were carried out with hepatic microsomes from various species and with recombinant human cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, showing that CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 are the prominent enzymes in the metabolism of ML3403. Michaelis-Menten kinetics of ML3603 formation by these recombinant isoenzymes showed that CYP3A4 plays a pivotal role in the sulfoxidation reaction. In addition, pharmacokinetics of ML3403 were evaluated in male and female Wistar rats after oral gavage, showing a fast and high conversion to its active sulfoxide metabolite ML3603. A remarkable gender-specific difference in the systemic exposure to ML3403 and ML3603 was found in rats. No gender-specific difference was detected in incubations with human liver microsomes.
2336835	The metabolic fate of 14C-ximoprofen in rats, baboons and humans. 1. The metabolic fate of 14C-ximoprofen was compared in rat (2 mg/kg), baboon (2 mg/kg) and human (approx. 0.4 mg/kg). An oral dose was well absorbed in all three species as indicated by urinary excretion of 80%, 86% and 94% dose respectively in 5 days: excreted in the faeces were 14%, 2% and 2% dose respectively. 2. Total 14C in plasma reached peak concentrations at 1-1.5 h in humans and earlier in animals. In humans, plasma 14C was initially associated mainly with unchanged drug which declined with a half-life of about 2 h (plasma 14C t1/2 about 8 h; cf. about 6 h in animals). 3. Tissue 14C concentrations in rats were generally similar to those in baboons at 1 h after dosing, decreasing substantially at later times. The distribution of 14C was consistent with that of a compound readily eliminated. 4. The major biotransformation products of ximoprofen were formed by hydrolysis to the keto-analogue followed by reduction to the hydroxy-analogue and conjugation of these two compounds. The same major metabolites were detected in urine of rat, baboon and humans but there was (a) complete biotransformation of ximoprofen in the rat, (b) an apparent difference in the nature of the conjugated component(s) in rat urine and those in baboon and human urine, (c) only one hydroxy-analogue detected in human urine but two such compounds in animal urine as indicated by mass spectrometry. 5. In human plasma at peak concentrations, the relative importance of circulating components was ximoprofen greater than keto-analogue greater than hydroxy-analogue, whereas in the plasma of the animal species this order was reversed, consistent with the more extensive biotransformation of ximoprofen observed in rat or baboon.
23390	Determination of the metabolites of bezitramide in urine. I. Acidic metabolite. Two methylation methods are compared in relation to the determination of low levels (less than microgram/ml) of the acidic metabolite of bezitramide in human urine. It was necessary to use alkali flame ionisation detector, which specifically detects nitrogen-containing compounds. Several difficulties associated with the use of this detector are described.
22393121	Metabolic switching of BILR 355 in the presence of ritonavir. II. Uncovering novel contributions by gut bacteria and aldehyde oxidase. Ritonavir (RTV) was used as a boosting agent to increase the clinical exposure of 11-ethyl-5,11-dihydro-5-methyl-8-[2-[(1-oxido-4-quinolinyl)oxy]ethyl]-6H-dipyrido[3,2-b:2',3'-e][1,4]diazepin-6-one (BILR 355), an inhibitor of the human immunodeficiency virus, by inhibiting the CYP3A-mediated metabolism of BILR 355. However, although the levels of BILR 355 increased upon concomitant administration of RTV, a metabolite of BILR 355, BILR 516, which was not detected previously in humans dosed with BILR 355 alone, became a disproportionate human metabolite with levels exceeding the parent levels at steady state. This was an unusual finding based on the in vitro and in vivo metabolic profiles of BILR 355 available at that time. Our studies reveal that BILR 355 is reduced to an intermediate, BILR 402, by gut bacteria and the reduced metabolite (BILR 402) is then oxidized by aldehyde oxidase to form BILR 516, the disproportionate human metabolite. The role of aldehyde oxidase helped to explain the somewhat unique formation of BILR 516 in humans compared with preclinical animal species. This article underlines the increasing importance of two individually atypical enzymes in drug development, gut bacterial biotransformation and aldehyde oxidase, which in combination provided a unique metabolic pathway. In addition, this article clearly elucidates an example of novel metabolic switching and, it is hoped, raises awareness of the potential for metabolic switching in combination drug therapies.
23073735	Effect of solvents on the time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4 and the biotransformation of AZD3839 in human liver microsomes and hepatocytes. Time-dependent inhibition (TDI) of the cytochrome P450 (P450) family of enzymes is usually studied in human liver microsomes (HLM) by investigating whether the inhibitory potency is increased with increased incubation times. The presented work was initiated after a discrepancy was observed for the TDI of an important P450 enzyme, CYP3A4, during early studies of the investigational drug compound AZD3839 [(S)-1-(2-(difluoromethyl)pyridin-4-yl)-4-fluoro-1-(3-(pyrimidin-5-yl)phenyl)-1H-isoindol-3-amine hemifumarate]; TDI was detected using a regulatory method but not with an early screening method. We show here that the different solvents present in the respective studies, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, screening method) versus methanol or water (regulatory method), were responsible for the different TDI results. We further demonstrate why DMSO, present at the levels of 0.2% and 0.5% in the incubations, masked the TDI effect. In addition to the TDI experiments performed in HLM, TDI studies with AZD3839 were performed in pooled human hepatocytes (Hhep) from different suppliers, using DMSO, methanol, or water. The results from these experiments show no TDI or attenuated TDI effect, depending on the supplier. Metabolite identification of the compound dissolved in DMSO, methanol, or water shows different profiles after incubations with the different systems (HLM or Hhep), which may explain the differences in the TDI outcomes. Thorough investigations of the biotransformation of AZD3839 have been performed to find the reactive pathway causing the TDI of CYP3A4, and are presented here. Our findings show that the in vitro risk profile for drug-drug interactions potential of AZD3839 is very much dependent on the chosen test system and the experimental conditions used.
16432511	Interspecies pharmacokinetics and in vitro metabolism of SQ109. This study aimed at characterizing the interspecies absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination (ADME) profile of N-geranyl-N'-(2-adamantyl)ethane-1,2-diamine (SQ109), a new diamine-based antitubercular drug. Single doses of SQ109 were administered (intravenously (i.v.) and per os (p.o.)) to rodents and dogs and blood samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Based on i.v. equivalent body surface area dose, the terminal half-life (t1/2) of SQ109 in dogs was longer than that in rodents, reflected by a larger volume of distribution (Vss) and a higher clearance rate of SQ109 in dogs, compared to that in rodents. The oral bioavailability of SQ109 in dogs, rats and mice were 2.4-5, 12 and 3.8%, respectively. After oral administration of [14C]SQ109 to rats, the highest level of radioactivity was in the liver, followed by the lung, spleen and kidney. Tissue-to-blood ratios of [14C]SQ109 were greater than 1. Fecal elimination of [14C]SQ109 accounted for 22.2% of the total dose of [14C]SQ109, while urinary excretion accounted for only 5.6%. The binding of [14C]SQ109 (0.1-2.5 microg ml-1) to plasma proteins varied from 6 to 23% depending on the species (human, mouse, rat and dog). SQ109 was metabolized by rat, mouse, dog and human liver microsomes, resulting in 22.8, 48.4, 50.8 or 58.3%, respectively, of SQ109 remaining after a 10-min incubation at 37 degrees C. The predominant metabolites in the human liver microsomes gave intense ion signals at 195, 347 and 363m/z, suggesting the oxidation, epoxidation and N-dealkylation of SQ109. P450 reaction phenotyping using recombinant cDNA-expressed human CYPs in conjunction with specific CYP inhibitors indicated that CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 were the predominant CYPs involved in SQ109 metabolism.
17404093	A Phase I pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of PX-12, a novel inhibitor of thioredoxin-1, in patients with advanced solid tumors. Thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) is a cellular redox protein that promotes tumor growth, inhibits apoptosis, and up-regulates hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor. Objectives of this study were to determine safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of PX-12, a small-molecule inhibitor of Trx-1. Thirty-eight patients with advanced solid tumors received PX-12 at doses of 9 to 300 mg/m(2), as a 1- or 3-h i.v. infusion on days 1 to 5, repeated every 3 weeks. At the 300 mg/m(2) dose level, one patient experienced a reversible episode of pneumonitis during the first cycle, and a second patient developed pneumonitis after the second cycle. Doses up to 226 mg/m(2) were well tolerated, and grade 3/4 events were uncommon (<3% of patients). The limiting factor on this dosing schedule was pungent odor caused by expired drug metabolite, 2-butanethiol. The best response was stable disease in seven patients (126-332 days). Whereas PX-12 was not detectable following the infusion, the C(max) of its inactive metabolite, 2-mercaptoimidazole, increased linearly with dose. PX-12 treatment lowered plasma Trx-1 concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. PX-12, the first Trx-1 inhibitor to enter clinical trials, was tolerated up to a dose of 226 mg/m(2) by a 3-h infusion. Based on pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data, a trial of prolonged infusion schedule of PX-12 has been initiated.
11442279	Induction of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase UGT1A1 by the flavonoid chrysin in Caco-2 cells--potential role in carcinogen bioinactivation. Dietary flavonoids, present in fruits, vegetables and beverages have been demonstrated to be protective in cancer. Recently, we showed that the flavonoid chrysin induced UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) activity and expression in the human intestinal cell line Caco-2. In the present study, we determined the specific UGT isoform(s) induced and whether this induction facilitates glucuronidation and potential detoxification of the colon carcinogen 2-hydroxyamino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (N-hydroxy-PhIP). The induction was studied by immunoblot analysis with UGT isoform-specific antibodies, by Northern blot analysis and using quercetin as an isoform-specific catalytic probe. Glucuronidation of N-hydroxy-PhIP was characterized using both recombinant UGTs and control and chrysin-treated microsomes. Western blot analysis showed that pretreatment of Caco-2 cells with 25 microM chrysin induced UGT1A1 without affecting the expression of UGTs 1A6, 1A9 and 2B7. Northern blot analysis showed markedly increased expression of UGT1AI mRNA after chrysin treatment. Similarly, glucuronidation of quercetin was greatly increased in a UGT1A1-specific way. The induction of UGT1A1 in the Caco-2 cells resulted in a 10-fold increase in the glucuronidation of N-hydroxy-PhIP. Dietary flavonoid-mediated induction of intestinal UGT1A1 may be important for the glucuronidation and detoxification of colon and other carcinogens as well as for the presystemic metabolism of therapeutic drugs.
19225040	Different inhibitory effects in rat and human carboxylesterases. In vitro inhibition studies on drug-metabolizing enzyme activity are useful for understanding drug-drug interactions and for drug development. However, the profile of the inhibitory effects of carboxylesterase (CES) activity has not been fully investigated concerning species and tissue differences. In the present study, we measured the inhibitory effects of 15 drugs and 1 compound on CES activity using liver and jejunum microsomes and cytosol in human and rat. In addition, the inhibition constant (K(i) values) and patterns were determined for the compounds exhibiting strong inhibition. Hydrolysis of imidapril and irinotecan hydrochloride (CPT-11) is catalyzed mainly by CES1 and CES2, respectively. In the inhibition study, imidaprilat formation from imidapril in human liver was strongly inhibited by nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) and procainamide. The inhibition profile and pattern were similar in human liver and rat liver. The compounds showing potent inhibition were similar between liver and jejunum. The K(i) value of NDGA (K(i) = 13.3 +/- 1.5 microM) in human liver microsomes was 30-fold higher than that in rat liver microsomes (K(i) = 0.4 +/- 0.0 microM). On the other hand, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38) formation from CPT-11 was not inhibited except by carvedilol, manidipine, and physostigmine. The K(i) value of physostigmine (K(i) = 0.3 +/- 0.0 microM) in human jejunum cytosol was 10-fold lower than that in rat jejunum cytosol (K(i) = 3.1 +/- 0.4 microM) and was similar to that for manidipine. The present study clarified the species differences in CES inhibition. These results are useful for the development of prodrugs.
15087594	Identification of benzene metabolites in dermal fibroblasts as nonphenolic: regulation of cell viability, apoptosis, lipid peroxidation and expression of matrix metalloproteinase 1 and elastin by benzene metabolites. The skin is exposed to benzene and its derivatives, prevalent environmental chemicals. They may impair the structural integrity of the skin by increased expression of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1; degrades structural collagen) and elastin, synthesized primarily by the dermal fibroblasts. We examined the metabolism of benzene in dermal fibroblasts and identified the benzene metabolites as toluene, benzaldehyde, aniline and benzoic acid. These metabolites were not toxic to the cells with regard to cell viability, apoptosis and lipid peroxidation, unlike the phenolic benzene metabolites (hydroquinone, t-butyl hydroquinone and phenol) or hydrogen peroxide. Toluene and phenol, which compose cigarette smoke, and benzaldehyde stimulated MMP-1 and/or elastin expression. In summary, the dermal fibroblasts metabolize benzene to nonphenolic metabolites that are less toxic to the cellular components than the phenolic benzene derivatives. Toluene, benzaldehyde and phenol can directly cause facial wrinkling and impaired structural integrity by upregulating MMP-1 and/or elastin.
22642721	The pharmacokinetics of darexaban are not affected to a clinically relevant degree by rifampicin, a strong inducer of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4. We investigated the effects of rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the direct clotting factor Xa inhibitor darexaban (YM150) and its main active metabolite, darexaban glucuronide (YM-222714), which almost entirely determines the antithrombotic effect. In this open-label, single-sequence study, 26 healthy men received one dose of darexaban 60 mg on day 1 and oral rifampicin 600 mg once daily on days 4-14. On day 11, a second dose of darexaban 60 mg was given with rifampicin. Blood and urine were collected after study drug administration on days 1-14. The maximal plasma drug concentration (C(max)) and exposure [area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to time of quantifiable measurable concentration; (AUC(last)) or AUC(last) extrapolated to infinity (AUC(∞))] were assessed by analysis of variance of PK. Limits for statistical significance of 90% confidence intervals for AUC and C(max) ratios were predefined as 80-125%. Darexaban glucuronide plasma exposure was not affected by rifampicin; the geometric mean ratio (90% confidence interval) of AUC(last) with/without rifampicin was 1.08 (1.00, 1.16). The C(max) of darexaban glucuronide increased by 54% after rifampicin [ratio 1.54 (1.37, 1.73)]. The plasma concentrations of darexaban were very low (<1% of darexaban glucuronide concentrations) with and without rifampicin. Darexaban alone or in combination with rifampicin was generally safe and well tolerated. Overall, rifampicin did not affect the PK profiles of darexaban glucuronide and darexaban to a clinically relevant degree, suggesting that the potential for drug-drug interactions between darexaban and CYP3A4 or P-glycoprotein-inducing agents is low.
21439153	Simultaneous quantification of triazolam and its metabolites in human urine by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A simple, simultaneous, sensitive and selective liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) method for the determination of triazolam and its metabolites, α-hydroxytriazolam (α-OHTRZ) and 4-hydroxytriazolam (4-OHTRZ), in human urine was developed and validated. Triazolam-d4 was used as the internal standard (IS). This analysis was carried out on a Thermo(®) C(18) column, and the mobile phase was composed of acetonitrile/H(2)O/formic acid (35:65:0.2, v/v/v). Detection was performed on a triple-quadrupole tandem MS using positive ion mode electrospray ionization, and quantification was performed by multiple reaction monitoring mode. The MS-MS ion transitions monitored were m/z 343.1 → 308.3, 359.0 → 331.0, 359.0 → 111.2, and 347.0 → 312.0 for triazolam, α-OHTRZ, 4-OHTRZ, and triazolam-d(4), respectively. The lower limits of quantification of the analytical method were 0.5 ng/mL for triazolam, 5 ng/mL for α-OHTRZ, and 0.5 ng/mL for 4-OHTRZ. The within- and between-run precisions were less than 15%, and accuracy was -12.33% to 9.76%. The method was proved to be accurate and specific, and it was applied to a urinary excretion study of triazolam in healthy Chinese volunteers.
17202802	Effect of cyclosporine and tacrolimus on cytochrome p450 activities in human liver microsomes. The effects of cyclosporine and tacrolimus on cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2-mediated 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation, CYP2C9-mediated tolbutamide hydroxylation, CYP2C19-mediated S-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation, CYP2D6-mediated debrisoquine 4-hydroxylation, CYP2E1-mediated chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylation, CYP3A4-mediated nifedipine oxidation, and CYP3A4-mediated testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation activities in human liver microsomes were compared. Cyclosporine and tacrolimus, at concentrations of 0.2 or 2 muM, neither inhibited nor stimulated any of the metabolic activities except for those of CYP3A4. On the other hand, cyclosporine and tacrolimus competitively inhibited CYP3A4-mediated nifedipine oxidation activity, with inhibition constants (K(i)) of 1.42 and 0.36 muM, respectively. In addition, 20 muM cyclosporine inhibited CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 activities by 29% and 30%, respectively. These results suggest that tacrolimus would not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs, which are metabolized by CYPs, via the inhibition of hepatic metabolism and that the reason why cyclosporine, but not tacrolimus, has a pharmacokinetic inhibitory effect might be that the dosage and/or the unbound concentrations around its metabolic enzymes are higher than those of tacrolimus, rather than the differences in the inhibition potential. Obvious substrate-dependent effects on CYP3A4-inhibition potential were not observed.
22022867	Investigation of the metabolism of rufinamide and its interaction with valproate. Rufinamide was evaluated in vitro to determine which enzyme(s) are responsible for rufinamide hydrolysis and whether valproate, one of its metabolites (valproyl-CoA), and/or the rufinamide hydrolysis product (CGP 47292) could inhibit hydrolysis. Rufinamide hydrolysis was mediated primarily by human carboxylesterase (hCE) 1 and was nonsaturable up to 500 μM. Two-thirds of rufinamide hydrolysis was estimated to occur in human microsomes and one-third in cytosol. Valproate was a selective inhibitor for hCE1 compared to hCE2 and inhibition had a greater impact on rufinamide hydrolysis in microsomes than in cytosol. Valproyl-CoA caused similar inhibition of rufinamide hydrolysis in both microsomes and cytosol. Carboxylesterases were not significantly inhibited by CGP 47292. Inhibition of in vitro rufinamide hydrolysis by valproate could offer an explanation for the observed in vivo drug-drug interaction between the two antiepileptic drugs.
11920947	An analytical method for irinotecan (CPT-11) and its metabolites using a high-performance liquid chromatography: parallel detection with fluorescence and mass spectrometry. Irinotecan or 7-ethyl-10-[4-(1-piperidino)-1-piperidino]carbonyloxycamptothecin (CPT-11) is an anticancer pro-drug used in the treatment of many types of cancer. We describe here the validation of an analytical method for CPT-11 and its metabolites, including an active metabolite, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38), its glucuronidated form, SN-38G, and several cytochrome P450 3A-mediated products such as 7-ethyl-10-[4-N-(5-aminopentanoic acid)-1-piperidino]carbonyloxycamptothecin (APC) using a high-performance liquid chromatography connected to parallel fluorescence and mass spectrometry detection systems. This method is characterized as follows: (1) simple extraction of the analytes from biomaterials with perchloric acid/methanol; (2) sensitive quantitation of major metabolites (SN-38G, SN-38 and APC) with a fluorescence detector (FLD), where the limits of quantitation by FLD were 2.5 ng/mL for SN-38G and APC, 5 ng/mL for CPT-11 and 1 ng/mL for SN-38, respectively; (3) parallel selective monitoring of the metabolites including minor metabolites with a mass selected detector (MSD). There was no observed interference by other drugs expected to be co-administered. This method showed its usefulness by identifying a novel metabolite produced in human hepatic microsomes. The results indicate that this combination of FLD and MSD enables a highly selective analysis of CPT-11 and its metabolites, and is useful for studies both in vivo and in vitro.
2715286	Determination of the new monoamine oxidase inhibitor brofaromine and its major metabolite in biological material by gas chromatography with electron-capture detection. A sensitive gas chromatographic assay for the simultaneous determination of brofaromine [4-(7-bromo-5-methoxy-2-benzofuranyl)piperidine hydrochloride], a new monoamine oxidase-A inhibitor, and its major metabolite was developed and validated. After addition of 4-(5-bromo-2-benzofuranyl)piperidine as internal standard, the compounds were isolated from biological fluids by liquid-liquid extraction at basic pH. After derivatization with heptafluorobutyric anhydride the compounds were chromatographed using a packed column (OV-17) and an electron-capture detector. The limit of quantitation was ca. 0.03 nmol per sample (10 ng) for both compounds. analysis of spiked samples demonstrated the good accuracy and precision of the method, which is suitable for use in pharmacokinetic and bioavailability studies. The method was applied to samples from an experiment in a healthy volunteer treated with a single oral dose of 75 mg of brofaromine hydrochloride. Plasma profiles before and after enzymic hydrolysis showed that about one-third of the total brofaromine in plasma and practically all of the major metabolite (O-desmethylbrofaromine) were present in the conjugated form.
21637928	Bioaccumulation assessment of the sunscreen agent 2-ethylhexyl 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)benzoate in human semen by automated online SPE-LC-MS/MS. The proven endocrine disruption nature of the sunscreen ingredient 2-ethylhexyl 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)benzoate (EDP) calls for research to understand its distribution and bioaccumulation in the human body. A sensitive analytical method to determine EDP and its metabolites in human semen based on online SPE-LC-MS/MS is described. The method has been fully validated and a standard addition calibration has been used for quantification to correct the observed matrix effects. The on-column detection limits of the analytes are between 0.2 and 0.6 ng, depending on the analyte and the sample. The repeatability of the method, expressed as relative standard deviation, was in the range 4.6-9.4%. The method was satisfactorily applied to semen samples from male volunteers who were subjected to single and repeated whole-body applications of an EDP-containing sunscreen product. EDP metabolites were found at different concentrations in semen samples from the repeated application study, thus showing evidences of bioaccumulation in humans.
19214962	A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for the simultaneous determination of exemestane and its metabolite 17-dihydroexemestane in human plasma. A simple and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method has been developed and validated for the quantitation of exemestane (Exe) and its main metabolite 17-dihydroexemestane (DhExe) in human plasma. The analytes were extracted by protein precipitation with acetonitrile, containing stable 13C-labelled Exe (13C3-Exe) as internal standard, and measured by LC-MS/MS. The best chromatographic separation of the analytes from the interferences was achieved by using a Phenyl column operating under isocratic regime conditions. The total chromatographic runtime was 5.0 min and the elution of Exe and DhExe occurred at 2.5 min and 2.9 min, respectively. Quantitation was performed by employing the positive electrospray ionization (ESI) technique and multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM). The monitored precursor to product-ion transitions for Exe, DhExe and 13C3-Exe internal standard were m/z 297.0 --> 120.8, m/z 299.1 --> 134.9 and m/z 300.0 --> 123.2, respectively. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) was 0.1 ng/ml for DhExe and 0.2 ng/ml for Exe. The method was linear up to 36-51 ng/ml with r2 > or = 0.998. The intra- and inter-assay precision were < or = 7.7% and 5.1% for Exe and < or = 8.1 and 4.9% for DhExe while deviations from nominal values were in the 1.5-13.2% and - 9.0-5.8% ranges for Exe and DhExe, respectively. The analytical method resulted robust and suitable for pharmacokinetic monitoring of Exe and its main metabolite during adjuvant therapy in patients with breast cancer.
626496	Pharmacokinetics of bacampicillin compared with those of ampicillin, pivampicillin, and amoxycillin. Bacampicillin, a new oral prodrug which in vivo is rapidly transformed to ampicillin, was compared with ampicillin, pivampicillin, and amoxycillin in a randomized cross-over study on 11 healthy volunteers. All drugs were given in oral doses equimolar to 400 mg of bacampicillin (800 mumol). The mean of the individual peak concentrations in serum was 8.3 mug/ml for bacampicillin, 7.1 mug/ml for pivampicillin, 7.7 mug/ml for amoxycillin, and 3.7 mug/ml for ampicillin. Furthermore, bacampicillin had a higher absorption rate than all the other drugs, although there were statistically significant differences only versus ampicillin. The peak serum levels of the individual subjects were more dispersed with ampicillin and amoxycillin, suggesting a more uniform absorption of bacampicillin and pivampicillin. The relative bioavailability of bacampicillin and pivampicillin was comparable, whereas ampicillin was only 2/3 that of the others.
20019910	Urinary phthalate metabolites in relation to preterm birth in Mexico city. Rates of preterm birth have been rising over the past several decades. Factors contributing to this trend remain largely unclear, and exposure to environmental contaminants may play a role. We investigated the relationship between phthalate exposure and preterm birth. Within a large Mexican birth cohort study, we compared third-trimester urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations in 30 women who delivered preterm (< 37 weeks of gestation) with those of 30 controls (> or = 37 weeks of gestation). Concentrations of most of the metabolites were similar to those reported among U.S. females, although in the present study mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP) concentrations were higher and monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP) concentrations lower. In a crude comparison before correcting for urinary dilution, geometric mean urinary concentrations were higher for the phthalate metabolites MBP, MBzP, mono(3-carboxylpropyl) phthalate, and four metabolites of di(2-ethyl-hexyl) phthalate among women who subsequently delivered preterm. These differences remained, but were somewhat lessened, after correction by specific gravity or creatinine. In multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for potential confounders, elevated odds of having phthalate metabolite concentrations above the median level were found. We found that phthalate exposure is prevalent among this group of pregnant women in Mexico and that some phthalates may be associated with preterm birth.
7614690	N-acetylbenzidine and N,N'-diacetylbenzidine formation by rat and human liver slices exposed to benzidine. The extent to which N-acetylbenzidine and N,N'-diacetylbenzidine are formed may influence benzidine-induced carcinogenesis. This study compared the formation of these metabolites by rat and human liver slices. The relationship between the NAT2 genotype and the formation of these acetylated products was also evaluated in humans. In rat liver slices incubated with 0.05 mM [3H]benzidine for 1 h (n = 3), N-acetylbenzidine and N,N'-diacetylbenzidine represented 8.8 +/- 3.6 and 73 +/- 2.5% respectively of the total radioactivity recovered by HPLC. No unmetabolized benzidine was observed. This suggests that an equilibrium exists between benzidine, N-acetylbenzidine and N,N'-diacetylbenzidine in rat liver slice incubations which favors N,N'-diacetylbenzidine formation. In the presence of 0.1 mM paraoxon, a deacetylase inhibitor, N-acetylbenzidine and N,N'-diacetylbenzidine increased to 13 +/- 0.6 and 79 +/- 0.3% respectively. Within 2 h after incubating human liver slices with 0.014 mM [3H]benzidine (n = 8), benzidine, N-acetylbenzidine and N,N'-diacetylbenzidine represented 19 +/- 5, 34 +/- 4 and 1.6 +/- 0.5%, respectively, of the total radioactivity recovered by HPLC. Thus in the human, conditions in liver slices favor N-acetylbenzidine rather than N,N'-diacetylbenzidine formation. With paraoxon, benzidine, N-acetylbenzidine and N,N'-diacetylbenzidine represented 2 +/- 0.4, 24 +/- 4 and 51 +/- 3%, respectively. This resulted in a 32-fold increase in N,N'-diacetylbenzidine formation. Individuals with rapid NAT2 genotypes formed 1.4-fold more N-acetylbenzidine than slow acetylators. However, this increase was not significant. There was no apparent correlation of N,N'-diacetylbenzidine formation with NAT2 genotype. Similar results were observed when human slices were incubated with 0.09 mM [3H]benzidine. Deacetylase, perhaps more than N-acetyltransferase, influences hepatic metabolism and subsequent carcinogenesis of benzidine in man. These results help explain the species and organ specificity of benzidine carcinogenesis.
20655369	Activation of P53 in HepG2 cells as surrogate to detect mutagens and promutagens in vitro. The current genotoxicity tests of the standard in vitro battery, especially those using mammalian cells, are limited by their low specificity and highlight the importance of new in vitro tools. This study aimed to evaluate the suitability of HepG2 cells for assaying mutagens and promutagens. We determined P53 activity as surrogate genotoxicity endpoint in HepG2 cells. Our results revealed a significant P53-induction by actinomycin D, methyl methanesulfonate and etoposide. Prior to the investigation of promutagens we characterized HepG2 cells by analyzing the expression of 45 genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism and measuring the activity of selected Cytochrome-P450 (CYP) enzymes. We determined a limited metabolic capacity prompting us to employ a co-treatment with rat liver S9 as metabolic activation system (MAS) for promutagens. While cyclophosphamide showed an elevation of activated P53 in the presence of S9, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene and aflatoxin B(1) responded without the MAS. Inhibition of cellular CYP3A4 or CYP1A/1B suppressed the aflatoxin B(1)- and dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-mediated P53 response, respectively, indicating that HepG2 cells are capable of metabolizing these compounds in a CYP1A/B/3A4-dependent manner. In summary, our results indicate that P53 activation in HepG2 cells combined with a MAS can be used for the identification of new (pro)genotoxicants.
23588565	Population pharmacokinetics analysis of cyclophosphamide with genetic effects in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. To build a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model of cyclophosphamide (CY) and its metabolite, 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide (HCY), in patients undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and to identify covariates, including genetic polymorphisms, which affect CY and HCY PK parameters. The study cohort comprised 21 patients undergoing HSCT who received CY intravenously between 2009 and 2011. Clinical characteristics and CY and HCY concentration data were collected for all patients, and ABCB1, ABCC2, GSTA1, GSTM1, GSTP1, GSTT1, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A5 genotyping was performed. A hypothetical enzyme compartment was conducted using the NONMEM program. A population PK analysis showed that the ABCC2 1249 genotype and aspartate aminotransferase levels significantly affected non-induced clearance (CL UI) and induced clearance (CL I) of CY, respectively. The final estimate of the mean CL UI and CL I of CY was 15.5 and 0.683 L/h, respectively, and the mean volume of distribution (V 1) of CY was 88.0 L. The inter-individual variability for CL UI, CL I, and V 1 of CY was 52.8, 200, and 18.0 %, respectively. Additionally, the CL UI of CY was significantly decreased to approximately 51 % in patients with the 1249 GA heterozygous genotype compared to those with the 1249 GG wild-type genotype (p < 0.05). There were only three heterozygous GA variants of ABCC2 1249 in the study patients. The population PK model developed in this study implies an influence of genetic factors on the clearance of CY. Clearance was moderately reduced in patients with the ABCC2 1249GA heterozygous genotype.
16242387	Metabolism of isometheptene in human urine and analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in doping control. A study of the metabolism of isometheptene, an antispasmodic drug, in man and comparison with heptaminol metabolism, is presented in this paper. Isometheptene and two metabolites were detected in human urine after oral administration of a tablet containing isometheptene mucate. The urine level of the parent drug, which is excreted during the first 24 h, was determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, after alkaline extraction with organic solvent. A minor metabolite of isometheptene was converted to heptaminol in vitro under the acidic hydrolysis conditions used for the screening procedure of stimulants and narcotics in doping control analysis.
21651615	Effect of rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of saxagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, in healthy subjects. To investigate the effect of co-administration of rifampicin, a potent inducer of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 enzymes, on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of saxagliptin and 5-hydroxy saxagliptin in healthy subjects. Saxagliptin is metabolized by CYP3A4/3A5 to 5-hydroxy saxagliptin, its major pharmacologically active metabolite. In a non-randomized, open label, single sequence design, 14 healthy subjects received single oral doses of saxagliptin 5 mg with and without steady-state rifampicin (600 mg once daily for 6 days). PK (saxagliptin and 5-hydroxy saxagliptin) and PD (plasma DPP-4 activity) were measured for up to 24 h on days 1 and 7. Concomitant administration with rifampicin resulted in 53% (point estimate 0.47, 90% CI 0.38, 0.57) and 76% (point estimate 0.24, 90% CI 0.21, 0.27) decreases in the geometric mean C(max) and AUC values of saxagliptin, respectively, with a 39% (point estimate 1.39, 90% CI 1.23, 1.56) increase in the geometric mean C(max) and no change (point estimate 1.03, 90% CI 0.97, 1.09) in the AUC of 5-hydroxy saxagliptin. Similar maximum % inhibition and area under the % inhibition-time effect curve over 24 h for DPP-4 activity were observed when saxagliptin was administered alone or with rifampicin. The saxagliptin total active moieties exposure (AUC) decreased by 27% (point estimate 0.73, 90% CI 0.66, 0.81). Saxagliptin with or without rifampicin in this study was generally well tolerated. Lack of change of PD effect of saxagliptin is consistent with the observed 27% reduction in systemic exposure to the total active moieties, which is not considered clinically meaningful. Based on these findings, it is not necessary to adjust the saxagliptin dose when co-administered with rifampicin.
14742145	'Open access' generic method for continuous determination of major human CYP450 probe substrates/metabolites and its application in drug metabolism studies. 1. An 'open access' generic high-performance liquid chromatography method was developed for different combination sets each containing specific cytochrome P450 probe substrate and the corresponding metabolite. Method development, optimization and validation were carried out with the following combinations: phenacetin + paracetamol + internal standard (IS, celecoxib), bufuralol + hydroxybufuralol + IS, testosterone + 6beta-hydroxytestosterone + IS, chlorzoxazone + 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone + IS, coumarin + 7-hydroxycoumarin + IS, tolbutamide + hydroxytolbutamide + IS, and diazepam + desmethyldiazepam + IS. 2. The assay procedure involved a simple one-step liquid/liquid extraction followed by reverse phase chromatography (Inertsil ODS 3V column) employing a ternary gradient system and the eluate was monitored by a photodiode array/fluorescence detector. The standard curve for each compound, in the concentration range 0.1-10 microg ml(-1), in various sets was linear (r(2)>0.99) and absolute recoveries of all analytes were >90%. The lower limit of quantification was 0.1 microg ml(-1). The intraday precision and accuracy in the measurements of quality control were <15% relative standard deviation and <15% deviation from nominal values, respectively. 3. Each combination set was tested with individual chemical inhibitors (furafylline, quinidine, ketoconazole, disulfiram, diethyldithiocarbamate, sulphaphenazole and tranylcypromine) and all analytes were well resolved. Overall, the assay is simple, uses conventional instrumentation and provides a scope to analyse all cytochrome P450 combination sets continuously. The application of the method in the cytochrome P450 liability screen of novel compounds is also presented.
15838656	Aprepitant inhibits cyclophosphamide bioactivation and thiotepa metabolism. Patients receiving the highly emetogenic high-dose chemotherapy regimen with cyclophosphamide, thiotepa and carboplatin (CTC) may benefit from the neurokin-1 receptor antagonist aprepitant in addition to standard anti-emetic therapy. As aprepitant has been shown to be a moderate inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isoenzyme, its effect on the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of cyclophosphamide and thiotepa was evaluated. Moreover, preliminary results on the clinical efficacy of aprepitant in the CTC regimen are reported. Six patients were enrolled in a protocol that employed a 4-day course of CTC high-dose chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide (1,500 mg/m2/day), thiotepa (120 mg/m2/day) and carboplatin (AUC 5 mg min/ml/day). Two patients received the tCTC protocol, which comprises two-third of the dose of CTC. In addition to standard anti-emetic therapy, the patients received aprepitant from one day before the start of their course until 3 days after chemotherapy. Blood samples were collected on days one and three of the course and analyzed for cyclophosphamide and its activated metabolite 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide, thiotepa and its main active metabolite tepa. The influence of aprepitant on the pharmacokinetics of cyclophosphamide and thiotepa was analyzed using a population pharmacokinetic analysis including a reference population of 49 patients receiving the same chemotherapy regimen without aprepitant and sampled under the same conditions. The frequency of nausea and vomiting in the six patients receiving CTC was compared with those of the last 22 consecutive patients receiving CTC chemotherapy without aprepitant. Inhibitory activity of aprepitant on cyclophosphamide and thiotepa metabolism was also tested in human liver microsomes. In our patient population, the rate of autoinduction of cyclophosphamide (P=0.040) and the formation clearance of tepa (P<0.001) were reduced with 23% and 33% when aprepitant was co-administered, respectively. Exposures to the active metabolite 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide and tepa were therefore reduced (5% and 20%, respectively) in the presence of aprepitant. In human liver microsomes, the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of aprepitant for inhibition of cyclophosphamide (IC50=1.3 microg/ml) and thiotepa (IC50=0.27 microg/ml) metabolism were within the therapeutic range. Patients receiving aprepitant experienced less frequently CINV both during and after the CTC course compared with the reference population (nausea 3.7 days vs. 5.8 days, P=0.052; vomiting 0.5 days vs. 4.8 days, P<0.001). Aprepitant inhibited both cyclophosphamide and thiotepa metabolism, most probably due to inhibition of the CYP 3A4 and/or 2B6 isoenzymes. The effects of this interaction are, however, small compared to the total variability. Addition of aprepitant may provide superior protection against vomiting in patients receiving the highly emetogenic high-dose CTC chemotherapy.
654310	Metabolism and urinary excretion of benzhexol in humans. 1. Benzhexol and three of its metabolites excreted in urine in man have been investigated by g.l.c.--mass spectrometry. 2. Three isomeric hydroxylated metabolites were identified as the 1-(hydroxycyclohexyl)-1-phenyl-3-piperidinopropan-1-ols. 3. The amounts of benzhexol and its identified metabolites have been semiquantitatively determined after a single oral dose in two healthy adults. Approx. 56% of the dose was excreted as the hydroxylated metabolites. The levels of benzhexol excreted were too low to be measured by the techniques used.
16326817	In vitro and in vivo evaluation of the metabolism and bioavailability of ester prodrugs of mgs0039 (3-(3,4-dichlorobenzyloxy)-2-amino-6-fluorobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic Acid), a potent metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist. MGS0039 (3-(3,4-dichlorobenzyloxy)-2-amino-6-fluorobicyclo-[3.1.0]hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid) has been identified as a potent and selective antagonist for metabotropic glutamate receptors. However, the oral bioavailability of MGS0039 is 10.9% in rats, due to low absorption. Several prodrugs, synthesized to improve absorption, exhibited 40 to 70% bioavailability in rats. This study investigated in vitro metabolism using liver S9 fractions from both cynomolgus monkeys and humans and oral bioavailability in cynomolgus monkeys to select the prodrug most likely to exhibit optimal pharmacokinetic profiles in humans. In monkeys, transformation to active substance was observed (5.9-72.8%) in liver S9 fractions, and n-butyl, n-pentyl, 3-methylbutyl, and 4-methylpentyl ester prodrugs exhibited high transformation ratios (>64%). Cmax levels and F values after oral dosing increased to 4.1- to 6.3-fold and 2.4- to 6.3-fold, respectively, and a close relationship between transformation ratios and Cmax and F values was observed, indicating that the hydrolysis rate in liver S9 fractions is the key factor in determining oral bioavailability in monkeys. In humans, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, 5-methylbutyl, and 6-methylpentyl ester prodrugs exhibited high transformation ratios (>65%) in liver S9 fractions. With these prodrugs, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, and 5-methylpentyl ester, almost complete recovery (96-99%) was obtained. Given the transformation ratio, we anticipated that the n-heptyl alkyl ester prodrug would exhibit the highest oral bioavailability of active substances in humans, if the hydrolysis rate in liver S9 fractions is indeed the key factor in determining oral bioavailability in humans. On this basis, MGS0210 (3-(3,4-dichlorobenzyloxy)-2-amino-6-fluorobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid n-heptyl ester) seems to be a promising candidate among MGS0039 prodrugs.
16451086	Evaluation of hydroxyimine as cytochrome P450-selective prodrug structure. Hydroxyimine derivatives of ketoprofen (1) and nabumetone (2) were synthesized and evaluated in vitro and in vivo as cytochrome P450-selective intermediate prodrug structures of ketones. 2 released nabumetone in vitro in the presence of isolated rat and human liver microsomes and in different recombinant human CYP isoforms. Bioconversion of 2 to both nabumetone and its active metabolite, 6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid (6-MNA), was further confirmed in rats in vivo. Results indicate that hydroxyimine is a useful intermediate prodrug structure for ketone drugs.
19966074	Single-Dose pharmacokinetics of sustained-release fampridine (Fampridine-SR) in healthy volunteers and adults with renal impairment. Fampridine-SR is a sustained-release formulation of fampridine (4-aminopyridine), a potassium channel blocker demonstrated to improve walking ability in patients with multiple sclerosis. This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of fampridine and its metabolites after administration of fampridine-SR 10 mg in healthy volunteers and in subjects with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment (5 per group). Analysis of variance was used to calculate 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the ratios (impaired/healthy) of least squares mean in maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). Clearance was primarily through urinary excretion. In renally impaired subjects, fampridine plasma concentrations were consistently higher than in healthy individuals: ratios for C(max) ranged from 166.5% to 199.9% for mild and severe renal impairment, respectively. AUC(0-infinity) ratios ranged from 175.3% to 398.7%, respectively, for mild and severe renal impairment. Mean terminal disposition half-life was 6.4 hours in healthy individuals, compared with 7.4, 8.1, and 14.3 hours in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively. Regression analysis confirmed the significant relationship between creatinine clearance and extent of exposure as quantified by AUC for fampridine and its metabolites, suggesting cautious use in patients with mild renal impairment and avoidance in cases of moderate or severe renal impairment.
17921187	Glucuronidation of monohydroxylated warfarin metabolites by human liver microsomes and human recombinant UDP-glucuronosyltransferases. Our understanding of human phase II metabolic pathways which facilitate detoxification and excretion of warfarin (Coumadin) is limited. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that there are specific human hepatic and extrahepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isozymes, which are responsible for conjugating warfarin and hydroxylated metabolites of warfarin. Glucuronidation activity of human liver microsomes (HLMs) and eight human recombinant UGTs toward (R)- and (S)-warfarin, racemic warfarin, and major cytochrome P450 metabolites of warfarin (4'-, 6-, 7-, 8-, and 10-hydroxywarfarin) has been assessed. HLMs, UGT1A1, 1A8, 1A9, and 1A10 showed glucuronidation activity toward 4'-, 6-, 7-, and/or 8-hydroxywarfarin with K(m) values ranging from 59 to 480 microM and V(max) values ranging from 0.03 to 0.78 microM/min/mg protein. Tandem mass spectrometry studies and structure comparisons suggested glucuronidation was occurring at the C4'-, C6-, C7-, and C8-positions. Of the hepatic UGT isozymes tested, UGT1A9 exclusively metabolized 8-hydroxywarfarin, whereas UGT1A1 metabolized 6-, 7-, and 8-hydroxywarfarin. Studies with extrahepatic UGT isoforms showed that UGT1A8 metabolized 7- and 8-hydroxywarfarin and that UGT1A10 glucuronidated 4'-, 6-, 7-, and 8-hydroxywarfarin. UGT1A4, 1A6, 1A7, and 2B7 did not have activity with any substrate, and none of the UGT isozymes evaluated catalyzed reactions with (R)- and (S)-warfarin, racemic warfarin, or 10-hydroxywarfarin. This is the first study identifying and characterizing specific human UGT isozymes, which glucuronidate major cytochrome P450 metabolites of warfarin with similar metabolic rates known to be associated with warfarin metabolism. Continued characterization of these pathways may enhance our ability to reduce life-threatening and costly complications associated with warfarin therapy.
12427108	Watercress has no Importance for the elimination of ethanol by CYP2E1 inhibition. Watercress, a cruciferous vegetable, is known to inhibit the metabolism of several CYP2E1 substrates such as paracetamol and chlorzoxazone. Since ethanol and its metabolite, acetaldehyde, are CYP2E1 substrates, the influence of watercress on ethanol and acetaldehyde was investigated in healthy human volunteers. According to a randomized cross-over design, ethanol and acetaldehyde pharmacokinetic parameters were determined in 9 persons at 3 occasions: without watercress and after watercress ingestion preceding ethanol consumption from 1 or 10.5 hr, respectively. Ethanol tmax occurred significantly later when watercress was ingested 1 hr before ethanol ingestion. Likewise, acetaldehyde Cmax was significantly higher whereas acetaldehyde AUCs were increased by watercress but not significantly. All other ethanol and acetaldehyde pharmacokinetic parameters were similar between the 3 treatments. In healthy volunteers, no major watercress effect was observed on ethanol clearance but a weak inhibiting effect on acetaldehyde metabolism is possible. Ethanol absorption is also delayed by single ingestion of watercress immediately preceding ethanol consumption.
15137977	Quantitative determination of a novel insulin sensitizer and its para-hydroxylated metabolite in human plasma by LC-MS/MS. I, 5-[3-[3-(4-phenoxy-2-propylphenoxy)-propoxy]-phenyl]-2,4-thiazolidinedione sodium salt, is a dual alpha/gamma peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist for potential use in diabetic patients. The compound has a para-hydroxylated metabolite, II, which has also been shown to exhibit PPAR activity. An LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous determination of I and its active metabolite (II) in human plasma has been successfully developed. The method consists of treating 0.5 ml plasma with ammonium acetate (pH 9.6; 50mM) and extracting I, II and internal standard (III, Fig. 2) with 5 ml ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate is evaporated and the samples are reconstituted in 0.1 ml acetonitrile:0.1% formic acid (65:35, v/v). The entire extraction procedure, as well as sample collection, was performed in glass tubes and vials to overcome the analytes adherence to polypropylene. A linear HPLC gradient was used to separate the analyte, metabolite, internal standard, and other interfering, non-quantitated metabolites. Detection was by negative ionization MS/MS on a turbo ionspray probe. Precursor-->product ion combinations were monitored in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The linear range is 0.05-20 ng/ml for I and 0.1-20 ng/ml for II. Recoveries were 59.4, 90.1 and 56.8% for I, II and III, respectively. Intraday variation using this method was <==7.0% for I and <==9.2% for II. The method exhibits good linearity and reproducibility for each analyte and good sensitivity, selectivity and robustness when used for the analysis of clinical samples.
20018470	Two cases of lysergamide intoxication by ingestion of seeds from Hawaiian Baby Woodrose. We describe two cases of human consumption of seeds from Argyreia nervosa (Hawaiian Baby Woodrose), which resulted in one fatality due to falling from a building and one surviving witness. The principal psychoactive constituent of the seeds, lysergamide (LSA), was recovered from blood and urine samples by mixed-mode cation exchange solid-phase extraction and quantified by ultra performance liquid chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-ToF/MS). The LSA concentrations were determined by UPLC-ToF/MS to be 4.9 microg/L in blood and 1.0mg/L in urine in the dead person and 1.8 microg/L in blood and 0.50mg/L in urine in the living person. These analytical findings were found to be in accordance with the case story, which indicated that seeds had been ingested and also noted psychological reactions, i.e. the will to jump out of the window. Other findings in the dead person were 22 microg/L THC in blood, 0.71 g/L ethanol in blood and 1.0 g/L ethanol in vitreous humor. Constituents originating from the seeds of A. nervosa, i.e. LSA, ergonovine, lysergic acid alpha-hydroxyethylamide were also identified in the biological samples. The 2-hydroxy-3-oxo metabolites of LSA and ergonovine were identified in the urine sample of the deceased.
17218485	A metabolic screening study of trichostatin A (TSA) and TSA-like histone deacetylase inhibitors in rat and human primary hepatocyte cultures. Hydroxamic acid (HA)-based histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, with trichostatin A (TSA) as the reference compound, are potential antitumoral drugs and show promise in the creation of long-term primary cell cultures. However, their metabolic properties have barely been investigated. TSA is rapidly inactivated in rodents both in vitro and in vivo. We previously found that 5-(4-dimethylaminobenzoyl)aminovaleric acid hydroxyamide or 4-Me2N-BAVAH (compound 1) is metabolically more stable upon incubation with rat hepatocyte suspensions. In this study, we show that human hepatocytes also metabolize TSA more rapidly than compound 1 and that similar pathways are involved. Furthermore, structural analogs of compound 1 (compounds 2-9) are reported to have the same favorable metabolic properties. Removal of the dimethylamino substituent of compound 1 creates a very stable but 50% less potent inhibitor. Chain lengthening (4 to 5 carbon spacer) slightly improves both potency and metabolic stability, favoring HA reduction to hydrolysis. On the other hand, Calpha-unsaturation and spacer methylation not only reduce HDAC inhibition but also increase the rate of metabolic inactivation approximately 2-fold, mainly through HA reduction. However, in rat hepatocyte monolayer cultures, compound 1 is shown to be extensively metabolized by phase II conjugation. In conclusion, this study suggests that simple structural modifications of amide-linked TSA analogs can improve their phase I metabolic stability in both rat and human hepatocyte suspensions. Phase II glucuronidation, however, can compensate for their lower phase I metabolism in rat hepatocyte monolayers and could play a yet unidentified role in the determination of their in vivo clearance.
7389256	Kinetics and metabolism of intramuscular neostigmine in myasthenia gravis. Neostigmine kinetics and metabolism were studied after intracellular administration to 8 patients with myasthenia gravis. The plasma neostigmine level declined monoexponentially from 21 +/- 2 to 9 +/- 1 ng/ml between 30 and 120 min. The data were interpreted in terms of a 1-compartment model. Estimates of plasma half-life (t1/2) ranged from 51.1 to 90.5 min; apparent volume of distribution varied from 32.0 to 60.6 1; and total body clearance from 434 to 549 ml/min. Approximately 80% of the drug was eliminated in urine within 24 hr either as unchanged neostigmine or its metabolites. Approximately 50% of the dose was eliminated as the unchanged drug, 15% as 3-hydroxyphenyltrimethylammonium, and 15% as other unidentified metabolites. The neostigmine t1/2, based on the urinary excretion of the unchanged drug, ranged from 90.2 to 118.7 min. It was concluded that neostigmine was eliminated by renal and extrarenal mechanisms.
19523935	Metabolism of carbosulfan. I. Species differences in the in vitro biotransformation by mammalian hepatic microsomes including human. The in vitro metabolism of carbosulfan, a widely used carbamate insecticide, by hepatic microsomes from human, rat, mouse, dog, rabbit, minipig, and monkey was studied. Altogether eight (8) phase I metabolites were detected by LC-MS; phase II metabolites were not found in human homogenates fortified with appropriate cofactors. The primary metabolic pathways were the initial oxidation of sulfur to carbosulfan sulfinamide ('sulfur oxidation pathway') and the cleavage of the nitrogen sulfur bond (N-S) to give carbofuran and dibutylamine ('carbofuran pathway'). Carbofuran was further hydroxylated to 3-hydroxycarbofuran and/or 7-phenolcarbofuran, which were further oxidized to 3-ketocarbofuran or 3-hydroxy-7-phenolcarbofuran, respectively, and finally to 3-keto-7-phenolcarbofuran. 3-Hydroxycarbofuran was the main metabolite in all species, but otherwise there were some qualitative interspecies differences in carbofuran pathway metabolites. Only rabbit liver microsomes were able to metabolize carbofuran via hydroxylation to 7-phenolcarbofuran. Carbofuran was not detected in dog liver microsomes due to rapid further metabolism. In general, liver microsomes from all seven species produced more toxic products (carbofuran, 3-hydroxy-carbofuran, 3-ketocarbofuran) more rapidly than a detoxification product (carbosulfan sulfinamide). Differences in intrinsic hepatic clearances (CL(int)) between the lowest and highest species were moderate; 2-fold for the carbofuran pathway, 2.7-fold for carbosulfan sulfinamide and 6.2-fold for dibutylamine. Our studies, although restricted to in vitro metabolic data from human and animal hepatic preparations, provide valuable quantitative carbosulfan-specific data for risk assessment, which suggest that interspecies differences, for carbosulfan active chemical moiety, in toxicokinetics are within the standard applied factor for species extrapolation in toxicokinetics. These results will be valuable in further defining the risks associated with exposure to carbosulfan.
17627976	A comparison of the expression and metabolizing activities of phase I and II enzymes in freshly isolated human lung parenchymal cells and cryopreserved human hepatocytes. The pulmonary and hepatic expression and catalytic activities of phase I and II drug-metabolizing enzymes were compared using human lung and liver tissue, and lung parenchymal cells (LPCs) and cryopreserved hepatocytes. Cytochrome P450 gene expression was generally lower in lung than in liver and CYP3A4 expression in lung was negligible. Esterase gene expression was similar in lung and liver. Expression of all sulfotransferase isoforms in lung was similar to or higher than that in liver. Lung tissue expressed low levels of UGT. However, the expression of UGT2A1 in lung was higher than that in liver. There was a range of catalytic activities in LPCs, including cytochrome P450, esterase, and sulfation pathways. Phase I activities were generally less than 10% of those determined in hepatocytes. Rates of ester hydrolysis and sulfation in LPCs were similar to those in hepatocytes. When measurable, glucuronidation in LPCs was present at very low levels, reflecting the gene expression data. The metabolism of salbutamol, formoterol, and budesonide was also investigated. Production of salbutamol-4-O-sulfate and budesonide oleate was observed in LPCs from at least two of three donor preparations studied. Formoterol sulfate and low levels of formoterol glucuronide were detected in one of three donors. In general, drug-metabolizing capability of LPCs is low compared with liver, although some evidence for substantial sulfation and deesterification capacity was observed. Therefore, these data support the use of this cell-based system for the investigation of key routes of xenobiotic metabolism in human lung parenchyma.
23347001	Biotransformation and pharmacokinetics of inositol hexanicotinate in rats. Inositol hexanicotinate (IHN) is an ester of the anti-hyperlipidemic drug nicotinic acid (NA). This study assessed the hydrolysis rate of IHN in human and rat plasma, and pharmacokinetics of the drug using a rat animal model. IHN (10 or 50 µg/mL) was incubated in plasma at 37 °C for 72 h. Kinetic parameters were determined based on the disappearance of IHN and the appearance of NA. The mean IHN disappearance and NA appearance half-lives were 1.07 and 3.93 h in human plasma, and 0.152 and 2.68 h in rat plasma. Increasing the initial plasma concentration to 50 µg/mL increased the NA appearance half-life in human and rat plasma to 4.66 and 6.47 h, respectively. After single 50 or 100 mg/kg intravenous dose of IHN to Sprague-Dawley rats, the drug showed statistically significant dose-dependent alterations in systemic clearance, suggesting a non-linear saturable elimination of IHN. Dose-normalized mean plasma levels of NA increased by 30% with increasing IHN dose (p < 0.02). The mean metabolic ratio (i.e. NA/IHN AUC ratio) significantly increased with increasing IHN dose (p < 0.05). The results provide first indication of saturable elimination and rapid disappearance of IHN, while niacin was slowly formed.
19931354	Bioanalytical method for the quantification of sunitinib and its n-desethyl metabolite SU12662 in human plasma by ultra performance liquid chromatography/tandem triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry. A rapid and sensitive ultra performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method has been developed and validated for the quantitative determination of sunitinib and its n-desethyl metabolite SU12662, in 100microl aliquots of human potassium EDTA plasma with deuterated sunitinib as internal standard. As sunitinib was found to be extremely sensitive to light causing rapid conversion of the Z (cis)-isomer to the E (trans)-isomer, the sample extraction and cleaning-up were performed under sodium-light and in amber vials. The extraction involved a simple liquid-liquid extraction with tert-butyl methyl ether. Chromatographic separations were achieved on an Aquity UPLC((R)) BEH C(18) 1.7microm, 2.1mmx50mm column eluted at a flow rate of 0.250ml/min on a gradient of acetonitrile. The overall cycle time of the method was 4min, with elution times of 1.05, 1.43, 0.95, and 1.34min, for the E (trans)- and Z (cis)-isomers of sunitinib and the E (trans)- and Z (cis)-isomers of SU12662, respectively. The multiple reaction monitoring transitions were set at 399>326 (m/z), at 371>283 (m/z) and at 409>326 (m/z) for sunitinib, SU12662 and the internal standard, respectively. The calibration curves were linear over the range of 0.200 to 50.0ng/ml with the lower limit of quantitation validated at 0.200ng/ml for both sunitinib and SU12662. The within-run and between-run precisions were within 11.7%, while the accuracy ranged from 90.5 to 106.8%.
22275272	Mass balance and metabolism of aclidinium bromide following intravenous administration of [¹⁴C]-aclidinium bromide in healthy subjects. Aclidinium bromide is a novel, inhaled long-acting muscarinic antagonist with low systemic activity developed for the treatment of COPD. It is an ester compound rapidly hydrolysed in plasma into inactive alcohol and acid metabolites. In this Phase I, open-label study, the rates and routes of elimination of radioactivity following intravenous administration of [¹⁴C]-aclidinium bromide were determined. The metabolites of aclidinium were also characterized and identified in plasma and excreta. Twelve healthy males were randomized (1:1) to receive a single intravenous 400 µg dose of [phenyl-U-¹⁴C]- or [glycolyl-U-¹⁴C]-aclidinium bromide (via 5 min infusion) to label alcohol or acid metabolites of aclidinium, respectively. Safety and tolerability were assessed over a 9-day period. Following intravenous administration, the parent compound was rapidly hydrolysed into its acid and alcohol metabolites. Primary excretion routes for [phenyl-U-¹⁴C]- and [glycolyl-U-¹⁴C]-aclidinium were renal (urine: 65% and 54%, respectively; feces: 33% and 20%, respectively), with 1% excreted as unchanged aclidinium. A total of three treatment-emergent adverse events in two subjects were reported and were related to infusion site pain. Overall, aclidinium is rapidly hydrolysed into two main metabolites, which are predominantly excreted in urine. Aclidinium bromide 400 µg administered intravenously was safe and well tolerated in healthy subjects.
18672911	Cytochrome P450 oxidation of the thiophene-containing anticancer drug 3-[(quinolin-4-ylmethyl)-amino]-thiophene-2-carboxylic acid (4-trifluoromethoxy-phenyl)-amide to an electrophilic intermediate. Compounds that are enzymatically transformed to reactive intermediates are common in nature. Some drugs and many phytochemicals that contain a thiophene ring are oxidized by cytochrome P450 to biological reactive intermediates (BRI) that can covalently bind to thiol nucleophiles. The investigational anticancer agent 3-[(quinolin-4-ylmethyl)-amino]-thiophene-2-carboxylic acid (4-trifluoromethoxy-phenyl)-amide (OSI-930) contains a thiophene moiety that can be oxidized by P450s to an apparent sulfoxide, which can react via Michael-addition to the 5-position of the thiophene ring, as demonstrated by mass spectral characterization of several thioether conjugates of the presumed thiophene S-oxide. Furthermore, a stable deuterium isotope retention experiment in which solvent deuterium was incorporated into the thiophene verifies the sulfoxide pathway. Various thiol nucleophiles are shown by tandem mass spectra to bind with this BRI, which is activated by P450 3A4 and to a slight degree, P450 2D6. Yet various safe drugs, phytochemicals, and endogenous molecules, all noted for their activation to BRI, are not toxic at a normal dose. Thus, multiple features determine any consequence of a BRI, with these complexities determining why one BRI is benign while another is not. The retention of covalent protein adducts of radio-labeled intermediate rat tissue has a half-life of about 1-1.5 days; hence, modified protein is cleared and replaced relatively quickly.
21319958	Identification of human UGT isoforms responsible for glucuronidation of efavirenz and its three hydroxy metabolites. Uridine 5'-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) involved in the glucuronide formation of efavirenz (EFV) and its three hydroxy metabolites, 8-hydroxyefavirenz (8-OH EFV), 7-hydroxyefavirenz (7-OH EFV), and 8,14-dihydroxyefavirenz (8,14-diOH EFV), were assessed. Among 12 recombinant UGT isoforms tested, only UGT2B7 showed catalytic activity in the formation of EFV-N-glucuronide (EFV-G) as previously reported. On the other hand, almost all UGT isoforms were involved in the glucuronidation of the three hydroxy metabolites, although their relative contribution is unclear. The catalytic activities in the formation of EFV-G by 17 different human liver microsomes exhibit a more than 40-fold inter-individual variability, whereas those of glucuronidation of the three hydroxy metabolites showed almost identical activity. The formation of EFV-G showed a significant correlation (r = 0.920; p < 0.0001) with UGT2B7-catalysed azidothymidine glucuronidation in 17 different human liver microsomes. Furthermore, fluconazole, a known UGT2B7 inhibitor, potently inhibited the formation of EFV-G up to 80%. This suggests that EFV might be a specific UGT2B7 substrate in vitro. This is the first study identifying specific UGT isozymes that glucuronidate EFV and its three hydroxy metabolites. Continued identification and characterisation of these pathways may help reduce adverse effects such as CNS toxicity in EFV therapy.
16757081	Diazinon, chlorpyrifos and parathion are metabolised by multiple cytochromes P450 in human liver. This research describes both the activation and detoxification of diazinon, chlorpyrifos and parathion by recombinant P450 isozymes and by human liver microsomes that had been characterised for P450 marker activities. Wide variations in activity were found for diazinon (50 microM; 500 microM) activation to diazoxon, chlorpyrifos (100 microM) to chlorpyrifos oxon and parathion (5 microM, 20 microM and 200 microM) to paraoxon in NADPH-dependent reactions. In parallel, the dearylated metabolites pyrimidinol (IHMP), trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP) and p-nitrophenol (PNP) were produced from diazinon, chlorpyrifos and parathion, respectively, with similarly wide variations in activity. There were significant correlations between diazoxon formation from diazinon (50 microM; 500 microM) with the three CYP3A4/5 marker reactions, while IHMP formation correlated significantly with the three CYP3A4/5 reactions, the CYP2C8 marker reaction (p<0.05) and the CYP2C19 marker (p<0.01). Chlorpyrifos oxon formation from chlorpyrifos did not correlate with any of the P450 markers but TCP formation correlated with one of the CYP3A4/5 reactions (p<0.01) and CYP2C8 (p<0.01), CYP2C19 (p<0.01) and CYP1A2 (p<0.01) mediated reactions. There were significant relationships between paraoxon formation from parathion (5 microM, 20 microM and 200 microM) and the CYP3A4/5, CYP2C8 and CYP1A2 mediated reactions, although only the latter two isoforms correlated significantly with the lowest parathion concentration. Recombinant CYPs 2D6, 2C19, 3A5, 3A4 were most efficient in producing diazoxon and IHMP from diazinon; CYPs 2D6, 3A5, 2B6 and 3A4 were best at producing chlorpyrifos-oxon and CYPs 2C19, 2D6, 3A5 and 3A4 at producing TCP from chlorpyrifos (100 microM). These data strongly suggest that CYPs 3A4/5, 2C8, 1A2, 2C19 and 2D6 are primarily involved in the metabolism of all three OPs, although the profile of participating isoforms was different for each of the pesticides suggesting that chemical structure influences which P450s mediate the reaction. The marked inter-individual variation in expression of the various P450 isozymes may result in sub-populations of individuals that produce higher systemic oxon levels with increased susceptibility to OP toxicity.
8695073	The pharmacokinetics of oxycodone in uremic patients undergoing renal transplantation. To determine the pharmacokinetics of oxycodone and the excretion of oxycodone and its metabolites noroxycodone and oxymorphone in uremic patients undergoing renal transplantation. Open study of the pharmacokinetics and excretion of oxycodone. IV Department of Surgery, Helsinki University Central Hospital. 10 uremic patients undergoing renal transplantation and 10 ASA status I patients undergoing general surgery. Intravenous (IV) oxycodone chloride 0.07 mg/kg was administered 30 minutes before induction of standardized anesthesia. Sampling of blood and urine was conducted for 24 hours. The concentrations of oxycodone and noroxycodone in plasma and the 24 hour urine recoveries of the conjugated and unconjugated forms of oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone were measured. Mean elimination half-life was prolonged in uremic patients due to increased volume of distribution and reduced clearance. Interindividual variation was very great. Plasma concentrations of noroxycodone were higher in uremic patients. Significantly smaller quantities of free oxycodone and noroxycodone and both free and conjugated oxymorphone were excreted in the urine in the uremic than in the control patients. Elimination of oxycodone is impaired in end-stage renal failure.
4036167	Carpipramine metabolism in the rat, rabbit and dog and in man after oral administration. Carpipramine administered orally is excreted via the urine and faeces in rat, rabbit, dog and man. Many metabolites are formed, including several conjugates in the urine. A total of 20-25 metabolites was detected by t.l.c. and h.p.l.c., 16 of which were isolated and identified. Three metabolic pathways were observed: hydroxylation of the iminodibenzyl ring to a phenol or alcohol without modification of the side-chain, hydroxylation of the terminal piperidine of the 2-piperidinol side-chain, and cyclization and dehydrogenation of the same 2-piperidinol group.
9169076	Physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling of a ternary mixture of alkyl benzenes in rats and humans. The objective of the present study was to develop a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for a ternary mixture of alkyl benzenes [toluene (TOL), m-xylene (XYL), and ethylbenzene (EBZ)] in rats and humans. The approach involved the development of the mixture PBPK model in the rat and extrapolation to humans by substituting rat physiological parameters and blood:air partition coefficients in the model with those of humans, scaling maximal velocity for metabolism on the basis of body weight0.75 and keeping all other model parameters species-invariant. The development of the PBPK model for the ternary mixture in the rat was accomplished by initially validating or refining the existing PBPK models for TOL, XYL, and EBZ and linking the individual chemical models via the hepatic metabolism term. Accordingly, the Michaelis-Menten equation for each solvent was modified to test four possible mechanisms of metabolic interaction (i.e., no interaction, competitive inhibition, noncompetitive inhibition, and uncompetitive inhibition). The metabolic inhibition constant (Ki) for each binary pair of alkyl benzenes was estimated by fitting the binary chemical PBPK model simulations to previously published data on blood concentrations of TOL, XYL, and EBZ in rats exposed for 4 hr to a binary combination of 100 or 200 ppm of each of these solvents. Competitive metabolic inhibition appeared to be the most plausible mechanism of interaction at relevant exposure concentrations for all binary mixtures of alkyl benzenes in the rat (Ki,TOL-XYL = 0.17; Ki,TOL-EBZ = 0.79; Ki,XYL-TOL = 0.77; Ki,XYL-EBZ = 1.50; Ki,EBZ-TOL = 0.33; Ki,EBZ-XYL = 0.23 mg/L). Incorporating the Ki values obtained with the binary chemical mixtures, the PBPK model for the ternary mixture simulated adequately the time course of the venous blood concentrations of TOL, XYL, and EBZ in rats exposed to a mixture containing 100 ppm each of these solvents. Following the validation of the ternary mixture model in the rat, it was scaled to predict the kinetics of TOL, XYL, and EBZ in blood and alveolar air of human volunteers exposed for 7 hr to a combination of 17, 33, and 33 ppm, respectively, of these solvents. Model simulations and experimental data obtained in humans indicated that exposure to atmospheric concentrations of TOL, XYL, and EBZ that remain within the permissible concentrations for a mixture would not result in biologically significant modifications of their pharmacokinetics. Overall, this study demonstrates the utility of PBPK models in the prediction of the kinetics of components of chemical mixtures, by accounting for mechanisms of binary chemical interactions.
16944149	Pharmacodynamic and toxicokinetic evaluation of the novel MEK inhibitor, PD0325901, in the rat following oral and intravenous administration. The MEK-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathway is involved with numerous cellular processes including cell growth and differentiation. Phosphorylation of MAPK (pMAPK) by MEK results in activation of this pathway. In various solid tumors, the MEK-MAPK pathway is constitutively active; therefore inhibition of this pathway may provide a therapeutic strategy for treating cancer. The objective of this study was to determine the extent and duration of inhibition of pMAPK in selected normal tissues in rats following single oral or intravenous (IV) doses of the novel MEK inhibitor, PD0325901. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (9/group) received either single oral (PO) or IV doses of PD0325901 at 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg (60, 180, and 600 mg/m(2), respectively). Controls received vehicle alone which was aqueous 0.5% hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose/0.2% Tween 80 for PO dosing and 20% beta-cyclodextran sulfobutyl ether in water (w:v) for IV dosing. Animals (3/group/day) were euthanized on Days 2, 3, and 4, at approximately 24, 48, and 72 h after dosing, respectively. The effects on pMAPK in liver and lung were determined by Western blot analysis and compared with plasma PD0325901 levels. Satellite animals (6/dose/route) received single PO or IV doses and serial blood samples were collected for determination of toxicokinetic parameters of PD0325901 and its major metabolite. In general, systemic exposure to PD0325901 was comparable between routes of administration due to high PO bioavailability (56-109%). Plasma area under the concentration-time curve values of the pharmacologically inactive carboxylic acid metabolite ranged from 18 to 40% of PD0325901. Clinical signs of toxicity occurred at 100 mg/kg PO or IV, indicating the maximum-tolerated dose had been achieved. On Day 2, pMAPK was inhibited 57-95% in liver and 86-99% in lung at all doses, irrespective of route of administration. On Day 3, lung pMAPK remained inhibited 75-91% at all IV doses and by 88% after the 100-mg/kg PO dose. Liver pMAPK remained inhibited 79 and 91% on Day 3 after 100 mg/kg by IV and PO doses, respectively. On Day 4, liver pMAPK was still inhibited 66% after the 100-mg/kg PO dose. The EC(50) and EC(90) plasma drug levels for inhibition of lung pMAPK were calculated to be 20 and 99 ng/ml, respectively. Liver pMAPK levels were inhibited at least 50% at plasma PD0325901 concentrations > or =50 ng/ml. In conclusion, single PO or IV doses of PD0325901 resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of pMAPK in liver and lung. Inhibition of pMAPK in liver was comparable between routes of administration at < or =30 mg/kg, whereas inhibition of pMAPK in lung occurred for a longer duration following IV administration. Measurement of pMAPK in normal tissues served as a means for assessing the pharmacologic activity of PD0325901 and should be included in toxicity studies to evaluate toxicity-pharmacology relationships.
12457882	Nordihydroguaiaretic acid: hepatotoxicity and detoxification in the mouse. Larrea tridentata (Moc & Sess) Cov. (Zygophyllaceae) is an ethnobotanically important plant found in the American Southwest and northern Mexico. Although numerous beneficial effects have been attributed to this plant, several case reports have demonstrated high doses of Larrea-containing herbals induce hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity in humans. Nordihydriguaiaretic acid (NDGA) is a lignan found in high amounts (up to 10% by dry weight) in the leaves and twigs of L. tridentata. Previously, NDGA has been shown to induce cystic nephropathy in the rat, however, no reports have been made concerning this compound's hepatotoxic potential. Here, we report that intraperitoneal administration of NDGA is lethal in the mouse (LD(50)=75 mg/kg). Administration is associated with a time and dose-dependent increase in serum alanine aminotransferase levels, which suggest liver damage. Indeed, freshly isolated mouse hepatocytes are more sensitive to NDGA than human melanoma cells. Furthermore, we have identified glucuronidation as a potential detoxification mechanism for NDGA. Both mono and diglucuronide conjugates of NDGA are formed after intravenous dosing. The monoglucuronide is also formed after incubation of NDGA with human hepatic microsomes; suggesting that glucuronide conjugation is important in the metabolism of NDGA by humans. In summary, this report indicates that NDGA may contribute to the hepatotoxicity of L. tridentata and provides preliminary information on NDGA metabolism.
22474055	Assessment of exposure of metabolites in preclinical species and humans at steady state from the single-dose radiolabeled absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion studies: a case study. The exposure of a drug candidate and its metabolites in humans and preclinical species during drug development needs to be determined to ensure that the safety of drug-related components in humans is adequately assessed in the standard toxicology studies. The in vivo radiolabeled studies in preclinical species and human volunteers provide the total fate of the drug-derived radioactivity including the relative abundance of metabolites. Here, we describe how the single-dose radiolabeled human studies could provide the exposure of circulating metabolites at steady state using a case study of an extensively metabolized drug, lixivaptan. After an oral dose of [(14)C]lixivaptan to humans, a total of nine metabolites were detected in the systemic circulation; eight of them exceeded 10% of the parent exposure (2-41% of total radioactivity). The plasma samples were profiled for all subjects at each time point by high-performance liquid chromatography, and metabolites were quantified using a radioactive detector. On the basis of single-dose area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) values, exposure of six human metabolites was greater at least in one preclinical species used in toxicology evaluation. On the basis of the t(1/2) of lixivaptan and two major metabolites from a single dose in humans, their AUC and C(max) values were simulated at the steady state. The simulated exposure (C(max) and AUC) values of parent drug and the two most abundant metabolites were similar to those from a 7-day clinical study obtained using a validated liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry assay, suggesting that a well designed single-dose radiolabeled human study can help in addressing the metabolites in safety testing-related issues.
16857327	Characterization of the cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of a new cardioprotective agent KR-33028. KR-33028 (N-[4-cyano-benzo[b]thiophene-2-carbonyl]guanidine) is a new cardioprotective agent for preventing ischemia-reperfusion injury. This study was performed to characterize the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes that are involved in the metabolism of KR-33028. Hydroxylation (5-hydroxy- and 7-hydroxy-KR-33028) is major pathways for the metabolism of KR-33028 in human liver microsomes. Among the nine c-DNA expressed CYP isoforms tested, KR-33028 was 5-hydroxylated by CYP3A4 and 7-hydroxylated by CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2C19. These findings were supported by the combination of chemical inhibition studies in human liver microsomes and correlation analysis. Furafylline and ketoconazole potently inhibited hydroxylation of KR-33028 in human liver microsomes. Correlation analysis between the known CYP enzyme activities and the rates of the formation of 5-hydroxy- and 7-hydroxy-KR-33028 in the 16 human liver microsomes has showed significant correlations with CYP3A4-mediated midazolam 1'-hydroxylation and CYP1A2-mediated phenacetin O-deethylation, respectively. A 7-hydroxy-KR-33028 formation is also weakly correlated with CYP3A4-mediated midazolam 1'-hydroxylation. The kinetics of the major biotransformation of KR-33028 were studied: CYP3A4 mediated the formation of 5-hydroxy-KR-33028 from KR-33028 with Cl(int)=0.22microl/min/pmol CYP. The intrinsic clearance for 7-hydroxy-KR-33028 formation by CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 were 0.26, 0.19, and 0.03microl/min/pmol CYP, respectively. Taken together, these results provide evidence that CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are the major isoforms responsible for the hydroxy metabolites formation from KR-33028.
12920491	Metabolism and elimination of quinine in healthy volunteers. The aims were to investigate: (1) The renal elimination of quinine and its metabolites 3-hydoxyquinine, 2'-quininone, (10R) and (10S)-11-dihydroxydihydroquinine and (2) the relative importance of CYP3A4, CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 for the formation of 2'-quininone, (10R) and (10S)-11-dihydroxydihydroquinine in vivo. In a randomised three-way crossover study, nine healthy Swedish subjects received a single oral dose of quinine hydrochloride (500 mg), on three different occasions: (A) alone, (B) concomitantly with ketoconazole (100 mg twice daily for 3 days) and (C) concomitantly with fluvoxamine (25 mg twice daily for 2 days). Blood and urine samples were collected before quinine intake and up to 96 h thereafter. All samples were analysed by means of high-performance liquid chromatography. Co-administration with ketoconazole significantly increased the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) of 2'-quininone, (10S)-11-dihydroxydihydroquinine, and (10R)-11-dihydroxydihydroquinine, the geometric mean ratios (90% CI) of the AUC were 1.9 (1.8, 2.0), 1.3 (1.1, 1.7) and 1.6 (1.4, 1.8), respectively. Co-administration with fluvoxamine had no significant effect on the mean AUC of any of the metabolites. A mean of 56% of the administered oral quinine dose was recovered in urine after hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase relative to the 40% recovered before hydrolysis. Quinine is eliminated in urine mainly as unchanged drug and as 3-hydroxyquinine. The major metabolite of quinine is 3-hydroxyquinine formed by CYP3A4. There is no evidence for the involvement of CYP3A4, 1A2 or 2C19 in the formation of 2'-quininone, (10S)-11-dihydroxydihydroquinine and (10R)-11-dihydroxydihydroquinine in vivo. Glucuronidation is an important pathway for the renal elimination of quinine, mainly as direct conjugation of the drug.
8374050	Cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in acetaminophen activation by rat and human liver microsomes and their kinetics. Acetaminophen (APAP), a commonly used analgesic, is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes to a toxic intermediate which can be trapped by glutathione. Using this approach, involvement of enzymes in the activation of APAP and their kinetics were studied. With human liver microsomes, there were three apparent Km values (approximately 10,474, and 13,000 microM) for the oxidation of APAP to its glutathione conjugate. With rat liver microsomes (control and ethanol induced) the kinetic data were best fit to a two-Km model (approximately 30 and 1100 microM). Liver microsomes from dexamethasone (DEX)-treated female rats showed a single Km of 56 microM and a Vmax of 7500 pmol of product formed/(min.mg of protein). Antibodies specific for rat P450s 2E1 and 1A2 each inhibited approximately 40% of the APAP metabolism in control male rat microsomes. Only slight inhibition was observed with the P450 3A1/2 antibodies in control male or female rat liver microsomes. Antibodies against rat P450s 3A1/2 inhibited the activity in DEX microsomes by 80%. Antibodies inhibitory to human P450 3A4 inhibited 38% of the activity in human liver microsome sample HL107 and 76% in human microsome sample HL110. Human P450s (2A6, 2E1, 1A2, 3A4, 3A5, 3A3, 2D6, 2F1, 2C8, 2B6, and 2C9) expressed in Hep G2 cells using a vaccinia virus expression system were each tested for APAP metabolism. Of these, P450 2E1, 1A2, and 3A4 showed substantial activity, with respective Km and Vmax values of 680 microM and 330 pmol/(min.mg) for P450 2E1 (with added cytochrome b5), 3430 microM and 74 pmol/(min.mg) for P450 1A2, and 280 microM and 130 pmol/(min.mg) for P450 3A4.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
21229238	Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/APCI-MS/MS) methods for the quantification of captan and folpet phthalimide metabolites in human plasma and urine. Captan and folpet are fungicides largely used in agriculture. They have similar chemical structures, except that folpet has an aromatic ring unlike captan. Their half-lives in blood are very short, given that they are readily broken down to tetrahydrophthalimide (THPI) and phthalimide (PI), respectively. Few authors measured these biomarkers in plasma or urine, and analysis was conducted either by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography with UV detection. The objective of this study was thus to develop simple, sensitive and specific liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/APCI-MS/MS) methods to quantify both THPI and PI in human plasma and urine. Briefly, deuterated THPI was added as an internal standard and purification was performed by solid-phase extraction followed by LC/APCI-MS/MS analysis in negative ion mode for both compounds. Validation of the methods was conducted using spiked blank plasma and urine samples at concentrations ranging from 1 to 250 μg/L and 1 to 50 μg/L, respectively, along with samples of volunteers and workers exposed to captan or folpet. The methods showed a good linearity (R (2) > 0.99), recovery (on average 90% for THPI and 75% for PI), intra- and inter-day precision (RSD, <15%) and accuracy (<20%), and stability. The limit of detection was 0.58 μg/L in urine and 1.47 μg/L in plasma for THPI and 1.14 and 2.17 μg/L, respectively, for PI. The described methods proved to be accurate and suitable to determine the toxicokinetics of both metabolites in human plasma and urine.
19000552	Effect of CYP2D6 polymorphism on pharmacokinetics of a novel ACAT inhibitor, pactimibe and its unique metabolite, R-125528. Pactimibe is a novel ACAT inhibitor. The pharmacokinetics of pactimibe and its pharmacologically inactive plasma metabolite, R-125528, of which the main clearance pathway is CYP2D6, was affected by coadministration of quinidine. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of CYP2D6 polymorphism on pharmacokinetics of pactimibe and R-125528. In addition, exposure was examined after multiple doses of pactimibe sulfate in CYP2D6 poor metabolizer (PMs). 24 healthy male Caucasian volunteers, genotyped as extensive, intermediate, and poor metabolizers, were received single dose of 25 mg pactimibe. In a multiple-dose study, six CYP2D6 PMs received 100 mg pactimibe for 21 days and exposure of pactimibe and R-125528 was examined. In contrast to the mild 1.7-fold increase in AUC0-inf of pactimibe, a marked 3.1-fold increase in AUC0-tz of R-125528 was observed in CYP2D6 PMs. After multiple doses of 100 mg pactimibe to CYP2D6 PMs, the accumulation ratio of R-125528 reached 8.8-fold, however, the exposure of R-125528 in CYP2D6 PMs was covered by the exposure in additional metabolite safety testing. Although CYP2D6 polymorphism greatly affected the pharmacokinetics of R-125528 rather than pactimibe, the exposure in CYP2D6 PMs after a multiple dose of 100 mg pactimibe sulfate was covered by additional non-clinical metabolite safety testing. The finding is clinically informative with respect to the safety testing of drug metabolite present at disproportionately high levels in a special population with specific genetic back ground.
3200856	Synthesis of phosphatidylethanol--a potential marker for adult males at risk for alcoholism. Phosphatidylethanol, whose synthesis is catalyzed by a phospholipase D in a transphosphatidylation reaction, is a unique metabolite of ethanol. Phorbol 12-tetradecanoate 13-acetate, a tumor-promoting phorbol ester and stimulator of protein kinase C, activates this enzyme in peripheral blood lymphocytes. This system has been developed into an assay for measuring the potential of this pathway in human subjects. A pilot study of phosphatidylethanol synthesis in lymphocytes of adult males who have both an alcohol dependency and a family history of alcoholism has revealed that the average potential for phosphatidylethanol synthesis in this population is significantly elevated over that of control subjects.
23831704	High sensitive assay employing column switching chromatography to enable simultaneous quantification of an amide prodrug of gemcitabine (LY2334737), gemcitabine, and its metabolite dFdU in human plasma by LC-MS/MS. In this study we report a high sensitive method for the simultaneous analysis of LY2334737 (2'-deoxy-2',2'-difluoro-N-(1-oxo-2-propylpentyl)-cytidine), an amide prodrug of gemcitabine (2', 2'-difluoro-deoxycytidine), along with its active drug gemcitabine and its major metabolite dFdU (2',2'-difluoro-deoxyuridine) by LC-MS/MS. Quantification of all three analytes within a single analysis was challenging because the physio-chemical properties of LY2334737 were significantly different from gemcitabine and dFdU and was accomplished by incorporating column-switching. The assay was fully validated to quantify LY2334737 from 0.1 to 100ng/mL, gemcitabine from 0.25 to 100ng/mL and dFdU from 1 to 1000ng/mL in order to cover the diverse concentration ranges expected in clinical samples. A 25-fold dilution was also validated to accommodate any samples outside this range. Overall, the assay had good accuracy (ranging from -7.0 to 1.2% relative error) and precision (ranging from 2.1 to 8.4% relative standard deviation). Extraction efficiency was greater than 80% for all three analytes and there were no matrix effects. Plasma samples were stable for 24h at room temperature, 660 days in frozen storage, and at least 4 freeze-thaw cycles, at both -20 and -70°C. Data from clinical trials showed that plasma concentrations for LY2334737, gemcitabine, and dFdU were successfully quantified from a single LC-MS/MS analysis and that the assay ranges selected for the three analytes were appropriate and minimized the need for reanalysis.
21348538	Influence of renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus often have impaired renal function or may have impaired hepatic function, which can pose significant safety and tolerability issues for antihyperglycaemic pharmacotherapies. Therefore, the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of saxagliptin and its pharmacologically active metabolite, 5-hydroxy saxagliptin, in nondiabetic subjects with mild, moderate or severe renal or hepatic impairment, or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) were compared with saxagliptin and metabolite pharmacokinetics and tolerability in healthy adult subjects. Two open-label, parallel-group, single-dose studies were conducted. Subjects received a single oral dose of saxagliptin 10 mg (Onglyza™). Compared with healthy subjects, the geometric mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero extrapolated to infinity (AUC∞) for saxagliptin was 16%, 41% and 108% (2.1-fold) higher in subjects with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment, respectively. AUC∞ values for 5-hydroxy saxagliptin were 67%, 192% (2.9-fold) and 347% (4.5-fold) higher in subjects with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment, respectively. As creatinine clearance (CLCR) values decreased, saxagliptin and 5-hydroxy saxagliptin AUC∞ generally increased or became more variable. Twenty-three percent of the saxagliptin dose (measured as the sum of saxagliptin and 5-hydroxy saxagliptin) was cleared by haemodialysis in a 4-hour dialysis session. In the hepatic impairment study, the differences in exposure to saxagliptin and 5-hydroxy saxagliptin were less than 2-fold across all groups. As compared with healthy subjects matched for age, bodyweight, sex and smoking status, the AUC∞ values for saxagliptin were 10%, 38% and 77% higher in subjects with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment, respectively. These values were 22%, 7% and 33% lower, respectively, for 5-hydroxy saxagliptin compared with matched healthy subjects. One-half the usual dose of saxagliptin 5 mg (i.e. 2.5 mg orally once daily) is recommended for patients with moderate (CLCR 30-50 mL/min) or severe (CLCR<30 mL/min not on dialysis) renal impairment or ESRD, but no dose adjustment is recommended for those with mild renal impairment or any degree of hepatic impairment.
15257064	Steady-state pharmacokinetics of a new antipsychotic agent perospirone and its active metabolite, and its relationship with prolactin response. The authors investigated steady-state pharmacokinetics of perospirone and its active metabolite hydroxyperospirone (ID-15036) and its prolactin response in 10 schizophrenic patients receiving 16 mg twice daily. Plasma concentrations of perospirone, hydroxyperospirone, and prolactin were monitored just before and up to 12 hours after the dosing. Thereafter, the dose was decreased to 8 mg twice daily in 8 patients, and drug concentrations were determined. The geometric means of peak concentration (Css(max)), time to Css(max) (tmax), area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 hours [AUC (0-12)], and elimination half-life at steady state were 8.8 ng/mL, 0.8 hours, 22.0 ng x h/mL, and 1.9 hours, respectively, for perospirone, and those of Css(max), tmax, and AUC (0-12) for hydroxyperospirone were 29.4 ng/mL, 1.1 hours, and 133.7 ng x h/mL, respectively. There were no differences in dose-normalized Css(max) or AUC (0-12) perospirone and hydroxyperospirone between 16 mg/day and 32 mg/day of perospirone. Changes in prolactin concentration from 1 to 2 hours after the dosing were parallel with drug concentrations, and almost normal ranges of prolactin concentration were observed before the morning dose despite steady state. The current study indicated that perospirone is rapidly absorbed and rapidly eliminated, which influences the prolactin response. The active metabolite hydroxyperospirone may play an important role in the antipsychotic effect because the plasma concentration of this metabolite is higher than that of the parent compound.
16019952	In vitro metabolism and in vivo pharmacokinetics of quinoline 3-carboxamide derivatives in various species. The metabolism of a group of quinoline 3-carboxamide derivatives was evaluated in liver microsomes from various species. In addition, metabolism data were compared with in vivo pharmacokinetics in the mouse. The studied compounds were metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Microsomal clearance was low and seemed independent of a substituent in the quinoline moiety, whereas clearance was enhanced when an ethyl group replaced the methyl group at the carboxamide position. A similar metabolism with hydroxylated and dealkylated metabolites was found in the various species, with quantitative differences due to substituent. As predicted from the in vitro studies, in vivo pharmacokinetics showed low clearance and thus high exposure of the parent compounds in the mouse. The therapeutic effect seen in the acute EAE mouse model for these related compounds seems dependent on the high exposure of parent compound rather than formation of any potentially active metabolites.
16981901	Lack of a pharmacokinetic interaction between steady-state roflumilast and single-dose midazolam in healthy subjects. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of roflumilast, an investigational PDE4 inhibitor for the treatment of COPD and asthma, on the pharmacokinetics of the CYP3A probe drug midazolam and its major metabolites. In an open, randomized (for midazolam treatment sequence) study, 18 healthy male subjects received single doses of midazolam (2 mg oral and 1 mg i.v., 1 day apart) alone, repeated doses of roflumilast (500 microg once daily for 14 days) alone, and repeated doses of roflumilast together with single doses of midazolam (2 mg oral and 1 mg i.v., 1 day apart). A comparison of clearance and peak and systemic exposure to midazolam following administration of roflumilast indicated no effect of roflumilast dosed to steady state on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam. Point estimates (90% CI) were 0.97 (0.84, 1.13) for the AUC of i.v. midazolam and 0.98 (0.82, 1.17) for that of oral midazolam with and without roflumilast. Therapeutic steady state concentrations of roflumilast and its N-oxide do not alter the disposition of the CYP3A substrate midazolam in healthy subjects. This finding suggests that roflumilast is unlikely to alter the clearance of drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4.
21867423	Target-mediated metabolism and target-mediated drug disposition of the DPPIV inhibitor AMG 222. Pharmacokinetic and metabolism aspects of AMG 222 interaction with target enzyme, dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPPIV) were investigated. Inhibition of recombinant human DPPIV by AMG 222 was measured. IC(50) decreased as preincubation time increased. k(off), k(on) and K(d) were measured. Dilution assay indicated a long dissociation half-life (730 min) relative to DPPIV inhibitor vildagliptin. AMG 222 is a slow-on, tight-binding, slowly reversible inhibitor of DPPIV. Amide and acid metabolites arising from hydrolysis of AMG 222's cyano group were formed slowly by rhDPPIV, but not by microsomes or S9. The amide metabolite was converted to the acid metabolite by rhDPPIV, but not by an active site mutant. These metabolites of AMG 222 are formed by target-mediated metabolism of the cyano group, similar to vildagliptin. Human plasma protein binding of [(14)C]AMG 222 was saturable and concentration-dependent. After 30 min, [(14)C]AMG 222 was 80.8% bound at 1 nM and binding decreased to 29.4% above 100 nM. The plasma DPPIV concentration (4.1 nM) and human plasma AMG 222 concentrations that inhibit DPPIV, occurred in the range of concentration-dependent binding. Target-mediated drug disposition influences AMG 222 pharmacokinetics, similar to DPPIV inhibitor, linagliptin.
14576103	Chloramphenicol is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes. The inhibitory effect of chloramphenicol on human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms was evaluated with human liver microsomes and cDNA-expressed CYPs. Chloramphenicol had a potent inhibitory effect on CYP2C19-catalyzed S-mephytoin 4'-hydroxylation and CYP3A4-catalyzed midazolam 1-hydroxylation, with apparent 50% inhibitory concentrations (inhibitory constant [K(i)] values are shown in parentheses) of 32.0 (7.7) and 48.1 (10.6) microM, respectively. Chloramphenicol also weakly inhibited CYP2D6, with an apparent 50% inhibitory concentration (K(i)) of 375.9 (75.8) microM. The mechanism of the drug interaction reported between chloramphenicol and phenytoin, which results in the elevation of plasma phenytoin concentrations, is clinically assumed to result from the inhibition of CYP2C9 by chloramphenicol. However, using human liver microsomes and cDNA-expressed CYPs, we showed this interaction arises from the inhibition of CYP2C19- not CYP2C9-catalyzed phenytoin metabolism. In conclusion, inhibition of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 is the probable mechanism by which chloramphenicol decreases the clearance of coadministered drugs, which manifests as a drug interaction with chloramphenicol.
12924926	Inhibition of human liver microsomal (S)-nicotine oxidation by (-)-menthol and analogues. (-)-Menthol is a widely used flavoring ingredient present in mouthwash, foods, toothpaste, and cigarettes; yet, the pharmacological effects of menthol have not been widely studied. Mentholated cigarette smoking may increase the risk for lung cancer. Many African American smokers smoke mentholated cigarettes, and African Americans have a significantly higher incidence of lung cancer as compared with whites. There may be a relationship between the incidence of lung cancer and the type of cigarette smoked because the use of mentholated cigarettes by white smokers is significantly less and the incidence of lung cancer is less. The mechanism whereby (-)-menthol could increase the health risk of smoking is not known. The results of our in vitro studies herein show that (-)-menthol and synthetic congeners inhibit the microsomal oxidation of nicotine to cotinine and the P450 2A6-mediated 7-hydroxylation of coumarin. Replacement of the alcohol oxygen atom of menthol with other heteroatoms increased the potency of P450 2A6 inhibition. Thus, the K(i) value of (-)-menthol for inhibition of microsomal nicotine oxidation was 69.7 micro M but neomenthyl thiol possesses a K(i) value of 13.8 micro M. Menthylamine inhibited nicotine oxidation with a K(i) value of 49.8 micro M, but its hydroxylamine derivative gave an IC(50) value of 2.2 micro M. A series of 16 menthol derivatives and putative metabolites were procured or chemically synthesized and tested as inhibitors of P450 2A6. While highly potent inhibition of P450 2A6 was not observed for the menthol analogues examined, it is nevertheless possible that smoking mentholated cigarettes leads to inhibition of nicotine metabolism and allows the smoker to achieve a certain elevated dose of nicotine each day. This may be another example of self-medication to obtain the desired effect of nicotine.
20812200	Determination of anthocyanins in the urine of patients with colorectal liver metastases after administration of bilberry extract. Anthocyanins possess cancer chemopreventive properties in preclinical models. Their clinical pharmacology is only poorly understood. In this pilot study, anthocyanins and their metabolites were analysed in the urine of two patients with colorectal liver metastases. They received a single dose of 1.88 g standardized bilberry extract (mirtoselect) via either nasogastric or nasojejunal tube intra-operatively during liver resection. HPLC-MS/MS and HPLC-UV analysis showed there were more anthocyanins and metabolites in the urine of the patient who received mirtoselect via the stomach than via the jejunum. This result is consistent with information obtained in rodents which suggests the stomach is the predominant site for anthocyanin absorption.
18238857	Detection of novel reactive metabolites of trazodone: evidence for CYP2D6-mediated bioactivation of m-chlorophenylpiperazine. Several new glutathione adducts (M3-M7) of trazodone were tentatively identified in human liver microsomal incubations using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Following incubations with trazodone in the presence of glutathione, 1-(3'-chlorophenyl)piperazine (m-CPP), a major circulating and pharmacologically active metabolite of several antidepressants including trazodone, nefazodone, and etoperidone, was trapped with glutathione to afford the corresponding quinone imine-sulfydryl adducts M4 and M5. Two novel glutathione adducts of deschloro-m-CPP and deschloro-trazodone, M3 and M6, were also detected by tandem mass spectrometry. The identities of these m-CPP-derived glutathione adducts were further confirmed by LC/MS/MS analyses of microsomal incubations of m-CPP. To investigate the bioactivation mechanism, a regioisomer of m-CPP, 1-(4'-chlorophenyl)piperazine, was incubated in human liver microsomes. Blockage of bioactivation by 4'-chloro-substitution at least partially suggested that formation of m-CPP-derived glutathione adducts M3, M4, and M5 is mediated by a common quinone imine intermediate. A tentative pathway states that upon formation of the trazodone- and m-CPP-1',4'-quinone imine intermediates through initial 4'-hydroxylation, glutathione attacks at the chlorine position by an ipso substitution, resulting in 4'-hydroxy-3'-glutathion-deschloro-trazodone (M6) and 4'-hydroxy-3'-glutathion-deschloro-m-CPP (M3), respectively. In contrast to CYP3A4-dependent bioactivation of trazodone itself, formation of M4 was mediated specifically by CYP2D6, as evidenced by cDNA-expressed CYP2D6-catalyzing formation of M4 from m-CPP, strong inhibition of formation of M4 by quinidine, a specific CYP2D6 inhibitor, in both incubations of trazodone and m-CPP with human liver microsomes, and concentration-dependent inhibition of M4 formation by quinidine.
20086031	The metabolism and disposition of the oral dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, linagliptin, in humans. The pharmacokinetics and metabolism of linagliptin (BI1356, 8-(3R-amino-piperidin-1-yl)-7-but-2-ynyl-3-methyl-1-(4-methyl-quinazolin-2-ylmethyl)-3,7-dihydro-purine-2,6-dione) were investigated in healthy volunteers. The 10- and 5-mg (14)C-labeled drug was administered orally or intravenously, respectively. Fecal excretion was the dominant excretion pathway with 84.7% (p.o.) and 58.2% (i.v.) of the dose. Renal excretion accounted for 5.4% (p.o.) and 30.8% (i.v.) of the dose. Unchanged linagliptin was the most abundant radioactive species in all matrices investigated. The exposure (area under the curve 0-24 h) to the parent compound in plasma accounted for 191 nM . h (p.o.) and 356 nM . h (i.v.), respectively. The main metabolite 7-but-2-ynyl-8-(3S-hydroxy-piperidin-1-yl)-3-methyl-1-(4-methyl-quinazolin-2-ylmethyl)-3,7-dihydro-purine-2,6-dione (CD1790) was observed with >10% of parent compound systemic exposure after oral administration. The metabolite was identified as S-3-hydroxypiperidinly derivative of linagliptin. Experiments that included stable-labeled isotope techniques indicated that CD1790 was formed by a two-step mechanism via the ketone 7-but-2-yn-1-yl-3-methyl-1-[(4-methylquinazolin-2-yl)methyl]-8-(3-oxopiperidin-1-yl)-3,7-dihydro-1H-purine-2,6-dione (CD10604). The initial ketone formation was CYP3A4-dependent and rate-limiting for the overall reaction to CD1790. Aldo-keto reductases with minor contribution of carbonyl reductases were involved in the subsequent stereoselective reduction of CD10604 to CD1790. The antipodes of linagliptin and CD1790 were not observed with adequate enantioselective liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methods. Other minor metabolites were identified by mass spectrometry and NMR investigations. However, it was concluded that the metabolites of linagliptin only play a minor role in the overall disposition and elimination of linagliptin.
17429625	Preclinical pharmacokinetics and in vitro metabolism of dasatinib (BMS-354825): a potent oral multi-targeted kinase inhibitor against SRC and BCR-ABL. Dasatinib (BMS-354825), a potent oral multi-targeted kinase inhibitor against SRC and BCR-ABL, has recently been approved for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) in imatinib-acquired resistance and intolerance. In vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to characterize the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of dasatinib in mouse, rat, dog, and monkey. Possible mechanisms contributing to the incomplete oral bioavailability of dasatinib in animals were investigated. Metabolic stability of dasatinib was measured after incubation with liver microsomes (either NADPH- or UDPGA-fortified) and isolated hepatocytes obtained from mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human. In all cases, substrate depletion over time was measured, and appropriate scaling factors were used to predict in vivo clearance. Pharmacokinetics of dasatinib were determined in mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys after administration of single intravenous or oral doses. In addition, the routes of excretion were investigated after administration of dasatinib to bile duct cannulated (BDC) rats. Absorption and first-pass metabolism were evaluated as possible reasons for the incomplete oral bioavailability using various in vitro and in vivo models like Caco-2 cells, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) knockout mice, and intra-portal dosing in rats. In vivo systemic plasma clearance values of dasatinib were 62, 26, 25, and 34 ml/min/kg in mouse, rat, dog, and monkey, respectively. Scaling of in vitro hepatocyte and liver microsomal data gave reasonably good predictions of in vivo clearances across all species. Percent distribution in blood cells ranged from 43% in mouse to 57% in dog. Dasatinib showed high volumes of distribution (>3 l/kg) and high serum protein binding values (>90%) in all four species tested. Oral bioavailability of dasatinib ranged from 14% in the mouse to 34% in the dog. In rats, bioavailability after an intraportal dose was comparable to that after intra-arterial administration. In BDC rats, less than 15% of an intravenous dose was excreted unchanged in urine, bile, and the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that dasatinib is cleared primarily via metabolism. Dasatinib has high intrinsic permeability in Caco-2 cells, however, the efflux ratio was approximately two-fold indicating that it may be a substrate for an intestinal efflux transporter. However, in vivo studies in P-gp knockout mice versus wild-type mice showed no difference in the amount of dasatinib remaining unabsorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that P-gp may not be responsible for the incomplete bioavailability. Dasatinib shows intermediate clearance in mouse, rat, dog, and monkey, and distributes extensively in those species. Oxidative metabolism appears to be the predominant clearance pathway. The incomplete oral bioavailability may be due to both incomplete absorption and high first-pass metabolism. However, the efflux transporter, P-glycoprotein does not appear to be limiting oral absorption.
12576683	Glucuronidation of propofol and its analogs by human and rat liver microsomes. Propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol), widely used an intravenous anesthetic, is rapidly metabolized to its glucuronide in the in vivo studies. Kinetic parameters for the glucuronidation of propofol and its analogs, such as 2,5-diisopropylphenol, 2-tert-butyl-6-methylphenol, 2-tert-butyl-5-methylphenol, 2,6-dimethylphenol and 2,5-dimethylphenol, were determined in vitro using human and rat liver microsomes. 2,5-Dimethylphenol and 2-tert-butyl-6-methylphenol exhibited the highest and lowest glucuronidation rates, respectively. Substitutes at the 2,6-positions gave lower glucuronidation rates than those at the 2,5-positions in both the human and rat microsomes. 2,5-Diisopropylphenol was glucuronidated at a lower rate in human than propofol. The affinity of uridine 5'-diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase for disubstituted phenols, such as propofol, 2,5-diisopropylphenol, 2,5-dimethylphenol, and 2-tert-butyl-6-methylphenol, gave higher Km values in human liver microsomes than in rat ones, and lower Vmax values showed similar relationship, expect for Vmax in propofol. The alkyl group at the 6 position showed a higher Km for glucuronidation by a steric hindrance in the human and rat microsomes. Our results propose that the glucuronidation of propofol and its analogs may not be explained by only a steric hindrance.
15141102	Metabolic detoxification determines species differences in coumarin-induced hepatotoxicity. Hepatotoxicity of coumarin is attributed to metabolic activation to an epoxide intermediate, coumarin 3,4-epoxide (CE). However, whereas rats are most susceptible to coumarin-induced hepatotoxicity, formation of CE is greatest in mouse liver microsomes, a species showing little evidence of hepatotoxicity. Therefore, the present work was designed to test the hypothesis that detoxification of CE is a major determinant of coumarin hepatotoxicity. CE can either rearrange spontaneously to o-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (o-HPA) or be conjugated with gluatathione (GSH). o-HPA is hepatotoxic and is further detoxified by oxidation to o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (o-HPAA). In vitro experiments were conducted using mouse liver microsomes to generate a constant amount of CE, and cytosols from F344 rats, B6C3F1 mice, and human liver were used to characterize CE detoxification. All metabolites were quantified by HPLC methods with UV detection. In rats and mice, GSH conjugation occurred non-enzymatically and through glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), and the kinetics of GSH conjugation were similar in rats and mice. In rat liver cytosol, oxidation of o-HPA to o-HPAA was characterized with a high affinity K(m) of approximately 12 microM, and a V(max) of approximately 1.5 nmol/min/mg protein. In contrast, the K(m) and V(max) for o-HPA oxidation in mouse liver cytosol were approximately 1.7 microM and 5 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively, yielding a total intrinsic clearance through oxidation to o-HPAA that was 20 times higher in mouse than in rats. Human cytosols (two separate pools) detoxified CE through o-HPA oxidation with an apparent K(m) of 0.84 microM and a V(max) of 5.7 nmol/min/mg protein, for a net intrinsic clearance that was more than 50 times higher than the rat. All species also reduced o-HPA to o-hydroxyphenylethanol (o-HPE), but this was only a major reaction in rats. In the presence of a metabolic reaction replete with all necessary cofactors, GSH conjugation accounted for nearly half of all CE metabolites in rat and mouse, whereas the GSH conjugate represented only 10% of the metabolites in human cytosol. In mouse, o-HPAA represented the major ring-opened metabolite, accounting for the remaining 50% of metabolites, and in human cytosol, o-HPAA was the major metabolite, representing nearly 90% of all CE metabolites. In contrast, no o-HPAA was detected in rats, whereas o-HPE represented a major metabolite. Collectively, these in vitro data implicate o-HPA detoxification through oxidation to o-HPAA as the major determinant of species differences in coumarin-induced hepatotoxicity.
17956893	Cinacalcet's effect on the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, cyclosporine and mycophenolate in renal transplant recipients. The calcimimetic drug cinacalcet offers a novel therapeutic option to treat post-transplant hypercalcemia and hyperparathyroidism; however, the interaction with calcineurin inhibitors and mycophenolate has not been evaluated. In the present study the effects of cinacalcet on the pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine A (CsA), tacrolimus (Tac) and mycophenolate were investigated in 14 renal transplant recipients with stable renal function (mean creatinine 126.4 +/- 45.3 micromol/L). The patients were treated with either CsA (n = 8) or Tac (n = 6) in combination with mycophenolate/azathioprine and steroids. Twelve-hour pharmacokinetic investigations to measure CsA and its six main metabolites, Tac and mycophenolate concentrations were performed before and after 1-week treatment with 30 mg cinacalcet once daily. Cinacalcet treatment induced a significant 14.3 +/- 12.1% decrease in Tac AUC(0-12) (P = 0.039). Tac C(max), T(max) and T(1/2) also tended to decrease. The pharmacokinetics of CsA and mycophenolate were not significantly affected by concomitant treatment with cinacalcet. However, the secondary CsA metabolite, AM19, showed a significant increase of 9.0 +/- 9.5% during cinacalcet treatment (P = 0.040). Renal function decreased significantly from 78 +/- 11 to 72 +/- 12 mL/min (P = 0.019) and correlated with the increased levels of metabolite AM19 in the CsA group. Renal function was unchanged in the Tac group. Cinacalcet treatment showed a moderate effect on the Tac, but not CsA or mycophenolate, pharmacokinetics after 1-week concomitant treatment. This interaction appears to have minor clinical relevance. However, it is advisable to monitor renal function in CsA-treated patients due to the observed decrease in renal function.
14757321	Benzylmercapturic acid is superior to hippuric acid and o-cresol as a urinary marker of occupational exposure to toluene. The present study was initiated to examine whether urinary benzylmercapturic acid (or N-acetyl-S-benzyl cysteine, BMA), a mercapturate metabolite of toluene, increases in relation to the intensity of toluene exposure, and whether this metabolite is a better marker of occupational exposure to toluene than two traditional markers, hippuric acid and o-cresol. Accordingly, end-of-shift urine samples were collected from 122 printers and 30 office clerks (all men) in the second half of a working week. Solvent (toluene) exposure of the day (8 h) was monitored by means of diffusive sampling. Quantitative relation with toluene showed that BMA had a greater correlation coefficient with toluene (r = 0.7) than hippuric acid (r = 0.6) or o-cresol (r = 0.6). The levels in the urine of the non-exposed control subjects were below the detection limit of 0.2 microg/l for BMA, whereas it was at substantial levels for hippuric acid and o-cresol (239 mg/l and 32 microg/l as a geometric mean, respectively). Thus, BMA, hippuric acid and o-cresol could separate the exposed from the non-exposed when toluene was at < 1, 50 and 3 ppm, respectively. Overall, therefore, it appeared reasonable to conclude that BMA is superior to hippuric acid and o-cresol as a marker of occupational exposure to toluene.
1780973	Hemodialysis clearance of encainide and metabolites. The disposition of encainide and metabolites O-desmethylencainide (ODE) and 3-methyl-ODE (MODE) was evaluated in a 31-year-old hemodialysis patient following a 25 mg oral dose during an interdialytic period and a second 25 mg oral dose 48 h later, 2 h before a hemodialysis procedure. The inter- and intradialytic elimination half-lives were not different for encainide and its metabolites ODE and MODE. The hemodialysis clearance of encainide, MODE, and ODE are all less than 10% of the creatinine clearance of the dialyzer. Thus, hemodialysis does not result in clinically significant removal of encainide or its metabolites.
20722998	Glucuronidation of piceatannol by human liver microsomes: major role of UGT1A1, UGT1A8 and UGT1A10. Piceatannol, a dietary polyphenol present in grapes and wine, is known for its promising anticancer and anti-inflammatory activity. The aim of this study was to analyse the concentration-dependent glucuronidation of piceatannol in vitro. To determine the glucuronidation of piceatannol, experiments were conducted with human liver microsomes as well as using a panel of 12 recombinant UDP-glucuronosyltransferase isoforms. Furthermore, the chemical structures of novel glucuronides were identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Along with piceatannol it was possible to identify three metabolites whose structures were identified by LC-MS/MS as piceatannol monoglucuronides (M1-M3). Formation of M1 and M3 exhibited a pattern of substrate inhibition, with apparent K(i) and V(max)/K(m) values of 103 +/- 26.6 microm and 3.8 +/- 1.3 microl/mg protein per min, respectively, for M1 and 233 +/- 61.4 microm and 19.8 +/- 9.5 microl/mg protein per min, respectively, for M3. In contrast, formation of metabolite M2 followed classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with a K(m) of 18.9 +/- 8.1 microm and a V(max) of 0.21 +/- 0.02 nmol/mg protein per min. Incubation in the presence of human recombinant UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) demonstrated that M1 was formed nearly equally by UGT1A1 and UGT1A8. M2 was preferentially catalysed by UGT1A10 and to a lesser extent by UGT1A1 and UGT1A8. The formation of M3, however, was mainly catalysed by UGT1A1 and UGT1A8. Our results elucidate the importance of piceatannol glucuronidation in the human liver, which must be taken into account in humans after dietary intake of piceatannol.
21976622	Potential contribution of cytochrome P450 2B6 to hepatic 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide formation in vitro and in vivo. Results from retrospective studies on the relationship between cytochrome P450 (P450) 2B6 (CYP2B6) genotype and cyclophosphamide (CY) efficacy and toxicity in adult cancer patients have been conflicting. We evaluated this relationship in children, who have faster CY clearance and receive different CY-based regimens than adults. These factors may influence the P450s metabolizing CY to 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide (4HCY), the principal precursor to CY's cytotoxic metabolite. Therefore, we sought to characterize the in vitro and in vivo roles of hepatic CYP2B6 and its main allelic variants in 4HCY formation. CYP2B6 is the major isozyme responsible for 4HCY formation in recombinant P450 Supersomes. In human liver microsomes (HLM), 4HCY formation correlated with known phenotypic markers of CYP2B6 activity, specifically formation of (S)-2-ethyl-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenyl pyrrolidine and hydroxybupropion. However, in HLM, CYP3A4/5 also contributes to 4HCY formation at the CY concentrations similar to plasma concentrations achieved in children (0.1 mM). 4HCY formation was not associated with CYP2B6 genotype at low (0.1 mM) or high (1 mM) CY concentrations potentially because CYP3A4/5 and other isozymes also form 4HCY. To remove this confounder, 4HCY formation was evaluated in recombinant CYP2B6 enzymes, which demonstrated that 4HCY formation was lower for CYP2B6.4 and CYP2B6.5 compared with CYP2B6.1. In vivo, CYP2B6 genotype was not directly related to CY clearance or ratio of 4HCY/CY areas under the curve in 51 children receiving CY-based regimens. Concomitant chemotherapy agents did not influence 4HCY formation in vitro. We conclude that CYP2B6 genotype is not consistently related to 4HCY formation in vitro or in vivo.
17486328	The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4) inhibitor vildagliptin. Vildagliptin is a potent and selective dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-4) inhibitor that improves glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by increasing alpha- and beta-cell responsiveness to glucose. This study investigated the pharmacokinetics of vildagliptin in patients with hepatic impairment compared with healthy subjects. This was an open-label, parallel-group study in patients with mild (n = 6), moderate (n = 6) or severe (n = 4) hepatic impairment and healthy subjects (n = 6). All subjects received a single 100-mg oral dose of vildagliptin, and plasma concentrations of vildagliptin and its main pharmacologically inactive metabolite LAY151 were measured up to 36 h post-dose. Exposure to vildagliptin (AUC(0-infinity) and C(max)) decreased non-significantly by 20 and 30%, respectively, in patients with mild hepatic impairment [geometric mean ratio (90% CI): AUC(0-infinity), 0.80 (0.60, 1.06), p = 0.192; C(max), 0.70 (0.46, 1.05), p = 0.149]. Exposure to vildagliptin was also decreased non-significantly in patients with moderate hepatic impairment [-8% for AUC(0-infinity), geometric mean ratio (90% CI): 0.92 (0.69, 1.23), p = 0.630; -23% for C(max), geometric mean ratio (90% CI): 0.77 (0.51, 1.17), p = 0.293]. In patients with severe hepatic impairment, C(max) was 6% lower than that in healthy subjects [geometric mean ratio (90% CI): 0.94 (0.59, 1.49), p = 0.285], whereas AUC(0-infinity) was increased by 22% [geometric mean ratio (90% CI): 1.22 (0.89, 1.68), p = 0.816). Across the hepatic impairment groups, LAY151 AUC(0-infinity) and C(max) were increased by 29-84% and 24-63%, respectively, compared with healthy subjects. The single 100-mg oral dose of vildagliptin was well tolerated by patients with hepatic impairment. There was no significant difference in exposure to vildagliptin in patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment; therefore, no dose adjustment of vildagliptin is necessary in patients with hepatic impairment.
16788861	A Phase I study of the oral antimetabolite, CS-682, administered once daily 5 days per week in patients with refractory solid tumor malignancies. The development of nucleoside analogues has had a major impact on cancer therapy. CS-682 is a novel, orally administered nucleoside analogue with a unique mechanism of action. CS-682 undergoes conversion to the active metabolite, CNDAC, which then leads to the inhibition of DNA polymerase and a novel "DNA self-strand breaking mechanism." We conducted a Phase I study of CS-682, administered orally five days per week in patients with refractory solid tumor malignancies. Forty-eight patients were enrolled on study. The recommended phase II dose of 30 mg/m(2) given orally once daily for 5 days a week for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks off drug, was well tolerated. The most common dose limiting toxicity was neutropenia, which occurred at the highest dose levels of CS-682. This was correlated with higher CNDAC Cmax and AUC values. No tumor responses were noted in this heavily pretreated population. However, given the ease of administration and tolerability, further investigation of this agent is warranted.
11936218	Effects of flavonoids isolated from Scutellariae radix on cytochrome P-450 activities in human liver microsomes. A series of flavonoids isolated from Scutellariae radix were evaluated for their effects on cytochrome P-450 (CYP) activities in human liver microsomes. All flavonoids did not substantially inhibit pentoxyresorufin O-deethylation (CYP2B 1), mephenytoin 4-hydroxylation (CYP2C19), dextromethorphan O-demethylation (CYP2D6), and chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylation (CYP2E1) activities (IC50: >50 microM). Baicalein and 2',5,6',7-tetrahydroxyflavone inhibited hepatic testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation (CYP3A4) activity with a IC50 of 17.4 and 7.8 microM, respectively. Oroxylin A inhibited diclofenac 4-hydroxylation (CYP2C9) activity with a IC50 of 6.7 microM. In contrast, all flavonoids tested inhibited hepatic caffeine N'-demethylation (CYP1A2) with IC50 values ranging from 0.7 to 51.3 microM. Kinetic analysis revealed that the mechanism of inhibition varied according to the flavonoids. These results suggest that flavonoids tested are inhibitors of hepatic CYP1A2 and that the extracts of Scutellariae radix, widely used as a hepatoprotective agent, may protect the liver through the prevention of CYPIA2-induced metabolic activation of protoxicants.
14566442	Effect of the novel anxiolytic drug deramciclane on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the CYP3A4 probe drug buspirone. Preliminary in vitro findings indicated that the novel anxiolytic drug, deramciclane is a substrate for the cytochrome P(450) (CYP) 3A4 isoenzyme. Moreover, its co-administration with buspirone, another anxiolytic drug, is likely in clinical practice. The primary objective of the present study was to evaluate the in vivo effects of deramciclane on CYP3A4 activity as measured by buspirone pharmacokinetics. The secondary objective was to study the possible pharmacodynamic interaction between these two anxiolytic drugs. Sixteen healthy subjects received 60 mg deramciclane or matched placebo for 8 days in this randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. On day 8 of both phases, the subjects received a 20-mg single dose of buspirone. Buspirone and its active metabolite, 1-pyrimidylpiperazine (1-PP), concentrations were measured for 24 h. Pharmacodynamic testing and measurement of plasma prolactin concentrations were carried out on day 7 and day 8 to assess the pharmacodynamic consequences of deramciclane and buspirone co-administration. Repeated administration of deramciclane had no effect on CYP3A4 activity as measured by buspirone pharmacokinetics. However, deramciclane administration caused an inhibition of the further, not CYP3A4-dependent, metabolism of 1-PP as evidenced by 84% increase in the AUC ( P<0.001) and 20% increase in the elimination half-life ( P=0.0012) of 1-PP. Deramciclane did not potentiate the buspirone-induced increase in prolactin secretion. No significant differences were found in the psychomotoric testing or the subjective maximum sedation between the deramciclane phase and the placebo phase, either before or after buspirone administration. Of 16 subjects, 5 experienced dizziness during both study phases. Deramciclane does not inhibit CYP3A4 activity as measured by buspirone pharmacokinetics, and there were no indications of relevant pharmacodynamic interaction after multiple doses of deramciclane and a single dose of buspirone.
16780356	Chemical modification modulates estrogenic activity, oxidative reactivity, and metabolic stability in 4'F-DMA, a new benzothiophene selective estrogen receptor modulator. The benzothiophene selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), raloxifene and arzoxifene, in the clinic or clinical trials for treatment of breast cancer and postmenopausal symptoms, are highly susceptible to oxidative metabolism and formation of electrophilic metabolites. 4'F-DMA, fluoro-substituted desmethyl arzoxifene (DMA), showed attenuated oxidation to quinoids in incubation with rat hepatocytes as well as in rat and human liver microsomes. Incubations of 4'F-DMA with hepatocytes yielded only one glucuronide conjugate and no GSH conjugates, whereas DMA underwent greater metabolism giving two glucuronide conjugates, one sulfate conjugate, and two GSH conjugates. Phase I and phase II metabolism were further evaluated in human small intestine microsomes and in human intestinal Caco-2 cells. In comparison to DMA, 4'F-DMA formed significantly less glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. The formation of quinoids was further explored in hepatocytes in which DMA was observed to give concentration- and time-dependent depletion of GSH accompanied by damage to DNA, which showed inverse dependence on GSH; in contrast, GSH depletion and DNA damage were almost completely abrogated in incubations with 4'F-DMA. 4'F-DMA shows ligand binding affinity to estrogen receptor (ER)alpha and ERbeta with similarity to both raloxifene and to DMA. ER-mediated biological activity was measured with the ERE-luciferase reporter system in transfected MCF-7 cells and Ishikawa cells, and in MCF-7 cells, proliferation was measured. In all systems, 4'F-DMA exhibited anitestrogenic activity of comparable potency to raloxifene but did not manifest estrogenic properties, mirroring previous results on inhibition of estradiol-mediated induction of alkaline phosphatase activity in Ishikawa cells. These results suggest that 4'F-DMA might be an improved benzothiophene SERM with similar antiestrogenic activity to raloxifene but improved metabolic stability and attenuated toxicity, showing that simple chemical modification can abrogate oxidative bioactivation to potentially toxic metabolites without loss of activity.
21697613	Absence of excretion of the active moiety of bisacodyl and sodium picosulfate into human breast milk: an open-label, parallel-group, multiple-dose study in healthy lactating women. The aim of this study was to determine whether administration of the prodrugs bisacodyl (Bisa) and sodium picosulfate (SPS) leads to excretion of their common active metabolite, bis-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-pyridyl-2-methane (BHPM), in breast milk. Two groups of 8 healthy lactating women who had stopped breast feeding received multiple doses of Bisa or SPS. Plasma, urine, and breast milk were collected and concentrations of free and total BHPM were determined using validated liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry methods. BHPM remained below the limits of detection in breast milk following single- and multiple-dose administration of Bisa and SPS. First, BHPM plasma concentrations were observed after a lag time of about 3 to 4 h and 4 to 5 h following Bisa and SPS administration, respectively. C(max) was attained approximately 5 h after dosing of Bisa and 9 h after dosing of SPS. BHPM did not accumulate after multiple administrations of Bisa and only slightly accumulated following multiple doses of SPS. About 12% and 13% of Bisa and SPS was excreted as BHPM into urine at steady state. BHPM, the active moiety of Bisa and SPS, was not excreted into human breast milk. Hence, use of Bisa or SPS to treat constipation of breast-feeding women is considered well tolerated with regard to exposing infants to BHPM via breast milk.
8305581	Coupling of HPLC with 19F- and 1H-NMR spectroscopy to investigate the human urinary excretion of flurbiprofen metabolites. Results of an on-line HPLC-NMR analysis of human urine from a volunteer administered the anti-inflammatory drug flurbiprofen are reported. The two major human urinary metabolites, namely the glucuronides of flurbiprofen and of 4'-hydroxyflurbiprofen, have been identified using 1H- and 19F-NMR spectroscopy. In vivo conjugation of the racemic drug and its metabolites with D-glucuronic acid results in diastereomeric molecules which give resolved NMR spectra thereby permitting the diastereomeric proportions to be evaluated. The cause of the observed deviation from equal proportions is discussed. This study represents the first use of both 19F- and 600 MHz 1H-NMR spectroscopy coupled to HPLC.
18353592	HPLC determination of 4-hydroxy-anethole trithione in plasma via enzymatic hydrolysis and its application to bioequivalence study. A simple, selective and reproducible high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method via enzymatic hydrolysis of glucuronide conjugates of 4-hydroxy-anethole trithione (ATX) was established for simultaneous determination of ATX. Human plasma samples were hydrolyzed by beta-glucuronidase and followed by subsequent extraction with cyclohexane-isopropanol (95:5, v/v) using mifepristone as the internal standard. Chromatography was carried out on a reverse phase C(18) column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 microm) and kept at 30 degrees C, with UV detection set at 346 nm. The mobile phase consisted of a mixture of methanol and water (75:25, v/v), at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. It was validated and proved to be linear in the range of 20-1500 ng/ml, with the regression equation Y = 0.0016C-0.0069, r=0.9992. And the limit of quantification (LOQ) concentration in plasma was 20 ng/ml. The absolute recoveries of ATX at three concentrations were 32.04, 38.95 and 44.06% and the relative recoveries were 104.80, 102.53 and 107.04%, which showed that the analytical method was sensible, accurate and reproducible. The method was utilized on a double-blind, randomized, single dose, two period, and crossover bioequivalence study of ATT tablets produced by different companies in 20 healthy male Chinese subjects, with a washout between every two periods. Blood samples were collected over each period of 10h and various pharmacokinetic parameters were determined. Natural log-transformed values were compared by analysis of variance followed by classical 90% confidence interval for C(max), AUC(0-t) and AUC(0-infinity) and was found to be within the range, which indicated that the two products were bioequivalence.
15113553	Analysis of human urine for fifteen phthalate metabolites using automated solid-phase extraction. We improved our previous analytical method to measure phthalate metabolites in urine as biomarkers for phthalate exposure by automating the solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedure and expanding the analytical capability to quantify four additional metabolites: phthalic acid, mono-3-carboxypropyl phthalate, mono-isobutyl phthalate (miBP), and monomethyl isophthalate. The method, which involves automated SPE followed by isotope dilution-high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-electrospray ionization (ESI)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS), allows for the quantitative measurement of 15 phthalate metabolites in urine with detection limits in the low ng/ml range. SPE automation allowed for the unattended sequential extraction of up to 100 samples at a time, and resulted in an increased sample throughput, lower solvent use, and better reproducibility than the manual SPE. Furthermore, the modified method permitted for the first time, the separation and quantification of mono-n-butyl phthalate (mBP) and its structural isomer miBP. The method was validated on spiked pooled urine samples and on pooled urine samples from persons with no known exposure to phthalates.
17907785	NADPH-dependent covalent binding of [3H]paroxetine to human liver microsomes and S-9 fractions: identification of an electrophilic quinone metabolite of paroxetine. The primary pathway of clearance of the methylenedioxyphenyl-containing compound and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine in humans involves P450 2D6-mediated demethylenation to a catechol intermediate. The process of demethylenation also results in the mechanism-based inactivation of the P450 isozyme. While the link between P450 2D6 inactivation and pharmacokinetic interactions of paroxetine with P450 2D6 substrates has been firmly established, there is a disconnect in terms of paroxetine's excellent safety record despite the potential for bioactivation. In the present study, we have systematically assessed the NADPH-dependent covalent binding of [(3)H]paroxetine to human liver microsomes and S-9 preparations in the absence and presence of cofactors of the various phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes involved in the downstream metabolism/detoxification of the putative paroxetine-catechol intermediate. Incubation of [(3)H]paroxetine with human liver microsomes and S-9 preparations resulted in irreversible binding of radioactive material to macromolecules by a process that was NADPH-dependent. The addition of reduced glutathione (GSH) to the microsomal and S-9 incubations resulted in a dramatic reduction of covalent binding. Following incubations with NADPH- and GSH-supplemented human liver microsomes and S-9, three sulfydryl conjugates with MH(+) ions at 623 Da (GS1), 779 Da (GS2), and 928 Da (GS3), respectively, were detected by LC-MS/MS. The collision-induced dissociation spectra allowed an insight into the structure of the GSH conjugates, based on which, bioactivation pathways were proposed. The formation of GS 1 was consistent with Michael addition of GSH to the quinone derived from two-electron oxidation of paroxetine-catechol. GS 3 was formed by the addition of a second molecule of GSH to the quinone species obtained via the two-electron oxidation of GS 1. The mechanism of formation of GS 2 can be rationalized via (i) further two-electron oxidation of the catechol motif in GS 3 to the ortho-quinone, (ii) loss of a glutamic acid residue from one of the adducted GSH molecules, and (iii) condensation of a cysteine-NH 2 with an adjacent carbonyl of the ortho-quinone to yield an ortho-benzoquinoneimine structure. Inclusion of the catechol-O-methyltransferase cofactor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) in S-9 incubations also dramatically reduced the covalent binding of [(3)H]paroxetine, a finding that was consistent with O-methylation of the paroxetine-catechol metabolite to the corresponding guaiacol regioisomers in S-9 incubations. While the NADPH-dependent covalent binding was attenuated by GSH and SAM, these reagents did not alter paroxetine's ability to inactivate P450 2D6, suggesting that the reactive intermediate responsible for P450 inactivation did not leave the active site to react with other proteins. The results of our studies indicate that in addition to the low once-a-day dosing regimen (20 mg) of paroxetine, efficient scavenging of the catechol and quinone metabolites by SAM and GSH, respectively, serves as an explanation for the excellent safety record of paroxetine despite the fact that it undergoes bioactivation.
2932178	A revision of the metabolic disposition of amantadine. Amantadine is one of the most commonly used drugs for the control of tremor in Parkinson's disease. Additionally, it has an antiviral action in the prevention of type A influenza. It has been previously reported that amantadine is nearly completely eliminated in the urine. No metabolites have been detected. Surprisingly, in a case of amantadine overdose, several metabolites could be identified by gas chromatography/mas spectrometry. This finding prompted us to re-investigate the metabolism of amantadine under a therapeutic dosing regimen. The bulk of the dose was eliminated unchanged. However, eight metabolites could be identified. Besides N-acetylation which is the major metabolic pathway, several rather unusual metabolic pathways were observed: N-methylation, formation of Schiff bases and N-formiates. No metabolites with a hydroxylated adamantane ring system could be detected.
19681099	Two-injection workflow for a liquid chromatography/LTQ-Orbitrap system to complete in vivo biotransformation characterization: demonstration with buspirone metabolite identification. The relatively high background matrix in in vivo samples typically poses difficulties in drug metabolite identification, and causes repeated analytical runs on unit resolution liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) systems before the completion of biotransformation characterization. Ballpark parameter settings for the LTQ-Orbitrap are reported herein that enable complete in vivo metabolite identification within two HPLC/MS injections on the hybrid LTQ-Orbitrap data collection system. By setting the FT survey full scan at 60K resolution to trigger five dependent LTQ MS(2) scans, and proper parameters of Repeat Duration, Exclusion Duration and Repeat Count for the first run (exploratory), the Orbitrap achieved the optimal parallel data acquisition capability and collected maximum number of product ion scans. Biotransformation knowledge based prediction played the key role in exact mass ion extraction and multiple mass defect filtration when the initial data was processed. Meanwhile, product ion extraction and neutral loss extraction of the initial dependent data provided additional bonus in identifying metabolites. With updated parent mass list and the data-dependent setting to let only the ions on the parent mass list trigger dependent scans, the second run (confirmatory) ensures that all precursor ions of identified metabolites trigger not only dependent product ion scans, but also at or close to the highest concentration of the eluted metabolite peaks. This workflow has been developed for metabolite identification of in vivo or ADME studies, of which the samples typically contain a high level of complex matrix. However, due to the proprietary nature of the in vivo studies, this workflow is presented herein with in vitro buspirone sample incubated with human liver microsomes (HLM). The major HLM-mediated biotransformation on buspirone was identified as oxidation or hydroxylation since five mono- (+16 Da), seven di- (+32 Da) and at least three tri-oxygenated (+48 Da) metabolites were identified. Besides the metabolites 1-pyrimidinylpiperazine (1-PP) and hydroxylated 1-PP that formed by N-dealkylation, a new metabolite M308 was identified as the result of a second N-dealkylation of the pyrimidine unit. Two new metabolites containing the 8-butyl-8-azaspiro[4,5]decane-7,9-dione partial structure, M240 and M254, were also identified that were formed apparently due to the first N-dealkylation of the 1-PP moiety.
9252051	Analysis of some metabolites of organic solvents in urine by high-performance liquid chromatography with beta-cyclodextrin. Chromatographic separation of the metabolites derived from toluene, ethylbenzene, styrene and xylene was carried out on untreated urine samples from factory workers. The elution sequence was as follows: phenylglyoxilic acid, 3-hydroxy-2-butanone, hippuric acid, o-methylhippuric acid, p-methylhippuric acid, m-methylhippuric acid, p-cresol, m-cresol and o-cresol. The stability constants (K(G)) of cresol and methylhippuric acid derivatives were evaluated. The capacity factor (k'), selectivity factor (alpha) and resolution (Rs) are described with a variety of mobile phases containing beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD). The optimum concentration ratio of ethanol-water-acetic acid-beta-CD was determined to be 20:80:0.3:1.4%. Under these conditions, k' values of the five metabolites were 2<k'<6, and all alpha values were greater than 1.5. Simultaneous determinations of the metabolites were carried out in real urine samples from factory workers using the standard addition method. Validation of the method and the detection limit are described under the optimum conditions attained in this experiment.
20689019	Profiling of the compounds absorbed in human plasma and urine after oral administration of a traditional Japanese (kampo) medicine, daikenchuto. Daikenchuto (DKT), a pharmaceutical-grade traditional Japanese (Kampo) medicine, has been widely used for the treatment of various gastrointestinal disorders including postoperative ileus and has been integrated into the modern medical care system in Japan as a prescription drug. DKT is a multiherbal medicine consisting of Japanese pepper (zanthoxylum fruit), processed ginger, and ginseng with maltose as an additive. Despite substantial research on the pharmacological activities of DKT and its ingredients, the lack of studies on absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of DKT has made it difficult to obtain a consistent picture of its mechanism of action. In the present study, we constructed an analysis procedure consisting of seven conditions of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometric analysis, which enabled the identification of 44 ingredients of DKT component herbs. We investigated the plasma and urine profiles of these ingredients 0.5 to 8 h after oral administration of 15.0 g of DKT in four healthy volunteers. The results indicated that 1) hydroxy-α-sanshool and [6]-shogaol, the prominent peaks in plasma derived from Japanese pepper and ginger, respectively, were detected at 0.5 h and thereafter decreased throughout the sampling period; 2) ginsenoside Rb(1), a prominent peak derived from ginseng, increased gradually during the sampling period; 3) glucuronide conjugates of hydroxy-sanshools, shogaols, and gingerols were detected in plasma and urine; and 4) no obvious differences between samples from the two male and the two female individuals were observed. These results provide a strong basis for future studies on pharmacokinetics and pharmacology of DKT.
15635176	Identification of cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of FK228, a potent histone deacetylase inhibitor, in human liver microsomes. FK228 (FR901228, depsipeptide) is a potent histone deacetylase inhibitor currently in phase II clinical trials for cancer treatment. In the present study, the cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes responsible for FK228 metabolism in human liver microsomes were investigated. Incubation with human liver microsomes in the presence of an NADPH-generating system revealed that FK228 is metabolized to at least 10 different metabolites. Km and Vmax values for FK228 disappearance were 20.3 microM and 561.9 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively. Further studies were performed at a substrate concentration of 10 microM (half the Km value for FK228 disappearance). FK228 disappearance activities in human liver microsomes from 12 individuals strongly correlated (r2=0.957) with testosterone 6beta-hydroxylase activities, a marker enzyme activity of CYP3A4/5, but not with other P450 enzyme-specific activities (CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 4A). Among 14 recombinant heterologously expressed human P450s examined, CYP3A4 exhibited the highest activity of FK228 disappearance. CYP3A5, 1A1, 2B6, and 2C19 showed 16.8%, 5.2%, 1.6%, and 1.3% of the activity of CYP3A4, respectively. Other P450s showed no significant metabolic activity toward FK228. In addition, FK228 disappearance in human liver microsomes was markedly inhibited by ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, and an anti-CYP3A4 antibody. These results indicate that the metabolism of FK228 in human liver microsomes is catalyzed mainly by CYP3A enzymes, particularly CYP3A4.
239135	Metabolism of quinalbarbitone. The human metabolism of (+/-)-5-allyl-5-(1'-methylbutyl) barbituric acid (I), quinalbarbitone, taken orally, has been studied. Comparison of g.c. and g.c.-m.s. data from derivatized extracts of urine with similar data from synthetic samples confirmed the presence of the two diastereoisomeric forms of 5-allyl-5-(3'hydroxy-1'-methylbutyl)barbituric acid (II), 5-allyl-5-(3'-oxo-1'-methylbutyl)barbituric acid (III), 5-allyl-5-(1'-methyl-3'-carboxypropyl)barbituric acid (IV), and 5-(2',3'-dihydroxypropyl)-5-(1'-methylbutyl)barbituric acid (V) in the urine. There was no evidence for the urinary excretion of unchanged drug. The rate of excretion of these metabolites has been examined in some detail, and rate-limited kinetics shown to apply for excretion of the acid (IV) and the diol (V).
21783735	In vitro metabolism and interactions of the fungicide metalaxyl in human liver preparations. In order to provide additional information for risk assessment of the fungicide metalaxyl, the main objectives were (1) to elucidate the interactions of metalaxyl with different human liver cytochrome P450 enzymes, (2) to tentitatively identify and (semi)quantify metabolites in vitro and (3) to identify human CYP enzymes responsible for metabolism. The mean inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) for 7-pentoxyresorufin-O-dealkylation (CYP2B) and bupropion hydroxylation (2B6) were 48.9 and 41.7μM, respectively. The biotransformation reactions were hydroxylation, (di)demethylation and lactone formation. In human liver microsomes predominant metabolites were two hydroxymetalaxyl derivatives or atropisomers of one of the derivatives. On the basis of previous rat studies these could be N-(2-hydroxymethyl-6-methylphenyl)-N-(methoxyacetyl)alanine methyl ester and/or N-(2,6-dimethyl-5-hydroxyphenyl)-N-(methoxyacetyl)alanine methyl ester. The amounts of didemethylmetalaxyl N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-N-(hydroxyacetyl)alanine and lactone 4-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-3-methylmorpholine-2,5-dione were higher in homogenates than microsomes. The carcinogenic 2,6-dimethylaniline was not detected. Among the nine major human CYPs, CYP3A4 was the only one responsible for metalaxyl hydroxylation, while CYP2B6 was the major isoform responsible for (di)demethylation and lactone formation.
15607587	A foxy intoxication. Foxy is the colloquial name for the hallucinogen 5-ethoxy-diisopropyltryptamine (5-MeO-DIPT). A non-fatality involving a 23-year-old Caucasian man who ingested a capsule containing 5-MeO-DIPT is described. He presented to the Emergency Department, not with visual nor auditory hallucinations but with sensory hallucinations, that of formication and paranoia. He was observed and given supportive care for 4 h, then discharged without any known sequelae. Blood and urine were collected for laboratory analyses. Foxy and its metabolites were identified in urine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The concentrations of 5-MeO-DIPT in the serum and urine were 0.14 and 1.6 microg/mL, respectively. The drug undergoes oxidative deamination to form 5-methoxy-indole acetic acid. The urinary concentration of this metabolite was 0.17 microg/mL. Also, the urine contained three other related compounds. Two of them have been described in a previous case of 5-MeO-DIPT ingestion as 5-methoxy-isopropyltryptamine (5-MeO-IPT) and 5-methoxy-diisopropyltryptamine-N'-oxide (5-MeO-DIPT-N'-oxide). The third compound was substantially present in the urine and was tentatively identified as 5-hydroxy-diisopropyltryptamine (5-OH-DIPT). Only the parent drug, 5-MeO-DIPT was detected in the serum sample.
20864289	Automated system for on-line desorption of dried blood spots applied to LC/MS/MS pharmacokinetic study of flurbiprofen and its metabolite. This paper illustrates the development of an automated system for the on-line bioanalysis of dried blood spots (on-line DBS). In this way, a prototype was designed for integration into a conventional LC/MS/MS, allowing the successive extraction of 30 DBS toward the analytical system without any sample pretreatment. The developed method was assessed for the DBS analysis of flurbiprofen (FLB) and its metabolite 4-hydroxyflurbiprofen (OH-FLB) in human whole blood (i.e. 5 μL). The automated procedure was fully validated based on international criteria and showed good precision, trueness, and linearity over the expected concentration range (from 10 to 1000 ng/mL and 100 to 10,000 ng/mL for OH-FLB and FLB respectively). Furthermore, the prototype showed good results in terms of recovery and carry-over. Stability of both analytes on filter paper was also investigated and the results suggested that DBS could be stored at ambient temperature for over 1 month. The on-line DBS automated system was then successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study performed on healthy male volunteers after oral administration of a single 50-mg dose of FLB. Additionally, a comparison between finger capillary DBS and classic venous plasma concentrations was investigated. A good correlation was observed, demonstrating the complementarity of both sampling forms. The automated system described in this article represents an efficient tool for the LC/MS/MS analysis of DBS samples in many bioanalytical applications.
15073108	Single ascending dose tolerability, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase inhibitor Ro 09-4889. Ro 09-4889 was designed to enhance the anticancer efficacy of capecitabine (Xeloda) by generating a dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase inhibitor (DPDi) 5-vinyluracil (5-VU) preferentially in tumor tissues. This study assessed the tolerance to Ro 09-4889 treatment, and related pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data such as inhibition of DPD activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma uracil levels. This was a single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose escalation study in 64 healthy male volunteers at 1-, 5-, 20-, 50-, 75-, 100-, and 200-mg oral dose of Ro 09-4889. Also, food effect was assessed separately in a group dosed with 20 mg of the compound. No serious adverse effects or significant laboratory and electrocardiogram abnormalities were observed during the study. Ro 09-4889 has a short elimination half-life (t(1/2)) of 0.5 h, followed by metabolites 5'-deoxy-5-vinyluridine (5'-DVUR), 5'-deoxy-5-vinylcytidine (5'-DVCR), and 5-VU with t(1/2) of 1.3, 1.2, and 2 h, respectively. The major metabolite excreted in urine was 5-DVCR (45% of dose). The inhibition of PBMC DPD activity and the increase in plasma uracil were related to Ro 09-4889 dose. DPD inhibition versus dose and uracil AUC (area under the curve) versus dose were modeled using the E(max) model with a baseline effect. The model-predicted ED(50) value was 100 mg. Single oral doses of Ro 09-4889 ranging from 1 to 200 mg were well tolerated. On the basis of these findings, a 10-to-30-mg dose range of Ro 09-4889 combined with capecitabine could be appropriate for further evaluation in cancer patients.
18361508	Electrochemical generation of electrophilic drug metabolites: characterization of amodiaquine quinoneimine and cysteinyl conjugates by MS, IR, and NMR. The chemical reactivity of electrophilic metabolites usually prevents their detection in vivo since, by definition, they are relatively short-lived and are likely to undergo one or more structural modifications to form more stable final products. Electrochemical oxidation provides a means to generate reactive metabolites in an environment without the presence of such nucleophiles. This paper describes the results of our MS, MS/MS, NMR, IR, and computational studies on oxidation products (and conjugates) that have been generated electrochemically from the antimalarial agent amodiaquine. The electrophilic quinoneimine metabolite of amodiaquine was the major oxidation product following electrochemical oxidation at +600 mV. The absence of biological nucleophiles in the electrochemical experiment facilitated (i) the acquisition of a clean IR spectrum of the amodiaquine quinoneimine and (ii) the addition of biologically relevant nucleophiles under controlled conditions. The addition of cysteine gave four cysteinyl conjugates, while the addition of glutathione gave four glutathionyl conjugates. The product ion spectra of the conjugates formed in the electrochemical experiment were used to identify suitable fragments for selected reaction monitoring (SRM) to selectively search for these conjugates in human liver microsomal (HLM) incubations. The four cysteinyl conjugates, as well as the four glutathionyl conjugates, were also detected as metabolites in HLM. The experiment with cysteine was repeated on a preparative scale that allowed characterization of the major conjugates by (1)H NMR. Desethylamodiaquine, the major metabolite formed in human liver microsomes, was also generated electrochemically by oxidation of amodiaquine at +1200 mV followed by reduction at -800 mV. In conclusion, the EC-ESI/MS technique provides the unique opportunity to generate reactive metabolites in the absence of biological nucleophiles, which enables studies that can give insight into the nature of these reactive intermediates. Such knowledge is valuable for risk assessment of new compound classes and can be complementary to computer-based structure-activity relationships of carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, and teratogenicity.
21892880	The fate of 4-hydroxycarbazole metabolite: metabolism and carcinogenicity assessment of a β-adrenergic receptor modulator containing carbazole structure. LY377604 has a potential to form 4-hydroxycarbazole, which was reported in the literature as a mutagen. This safety concern led to our investigation of the metabolism and carcinogenicity of LY377604. In in vitro studies with LY377604, 4-hydroxycarbazole was detected in the presence of liver microsomes prepared from different species. When incubated with liver slices, only the conjugate of 4-hydroxycarbazole was detected. Subsequent in vivo radio-labelled studies were conducted to characterise the formation of 4-hydroxycarbazole from LY377604. Free 4-hydroxycarbazole was not detected in vivo, but the O-glucuronide conjugate was identified as a minor metabolite in urine samples, representing 0.2% and 0.9% of the radioactive dose in rats and monkeys. The low level of circulating 4-hydroxycarbazole glucuronide conjugate was also detected in plasma. LY377604 was negative in all genetic toxicology assays and was not associated with tumour induction in a 6-month carcinogenicity study using RasH2+/- mouse model. The exposure to free 4-hydroxycarbazole was not measurable after one dose and was about 0.1%-0.2% of the parent exposure at the end of the 6-month study. These data suggested that 4-hydroxycarbazole was formed as a minor metabolite in vivo, but it was primarily conjugated and excreted in urine as the glucuronide conjugate. The absence of tumours in the carcinogenicity study combined with the exposure data suggested that the low level of free 4-hydroxycarbazole did not represent a carcinogenic risk.
3424870	Disposition of 3H-enisoprost, a gastric antisecretory prostaglandin, in healthy humans. 1. After oral administration of 3H-enisoprost (450 micrograms) to five healthy men, as a solution in capsules, peak 3H levels of 5624 +/- 566 pg equiv./ml (mean +/- S.E.M.) were reached within one hour. No unchanged drug was detected in plasma. 2. Enisoprost was rapidly de-esterified to SC-36067 [(+/-)11 alpha, 16 zeta-dihydroxy-16-methyl-9-oxoprost-4Z, 13E-dien-1-oic acid], a pharmacologically active analogue, which reached peak concentrations of 651 +/- 200 pg/ml within 20 min of dosing. SC-36067 was eliminated metabolically, with a half-life of 1.61 h, by a combination of beta-oxidation, omega-oxidation and 9-keto-reduction. 3. After nine days 59.0 +/- 2.98% and 17.4 +/- 1.57% of the dose was excreted in urine and faeces respectively. The majority of this excretion was complete in two days. 4. Five urinary metabolites were identified by GC-MS. These were (+/-)3-[2 beta-(4-hydroxy-4-methyl-1E-octenyl)-3 alpha-hydroxy-5-oxo-1 alpha-cyclopentanyl]propanoic acid (SC-41411; 3.6% dose), (+/-)3-[3 alpha,5-dihydroxy-2 beta-(4-hydroxy-4-methyl-1E-octenyl)-1 alpha-cyclopentanyl]propanoic acid (SC-41411 PGF analogue; 4.8% dose), (+/-)3-[2 beta-(8-carboxy-4-hydroxy- 4-methyl-1E-octenyl)-3 alpha-hydroxy-5-oxo-1 alpha-cyclopentanyl] propanoic acid (SC-41411-16-carboxylic acid; 22% dose), (+/-)3-[2 beta-(8-carboxy-4- hydroxy-4-methyl-1E-octenyl)-3 alpha,5-dihydroxy-1 alpha-cyclopentanyl] propanoic acid (SC-41411 PGF analogue-16-carboxylic acid; 8.5% dose) and its gamma lactone (2.6% dose). 5. These metabolites were also identified chromatographically in plasma, as were SC-36067, (+/-)3-[2 beta-(4-hydroxy-4-methyl-1E-octenyl)-5-oxo-1 alpha- cyclopent-3-enyl]propanoic acid and (+/-)3-[2 beta-(4-hydroxy-4-methyl-1E-octenyl)-5-oxo-cyclopent-1- propanoic acid. 6. Some 5-10% of the dose was excreted in urine as tritiated water, indicating that oxidation of the 11 alpha-hydroxy group in SC-36067 or its metabolites also occurred.
18692448	Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric assay for the quantitation in human plasma of ABT-888, an orally available, small molecule inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. ABT-888, a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) -inhibitor in clinical trials, potentiates DNA-damaging agents. We developed and validated, according to FDA guidelines, an LC-MS assay for sensitive, accurate and precise quantitation of ABT-888 and its metabolite M8 in 0.2 mL human plasma. After ethyl acetate extraction, separation is achieved with a hydro-Synergi column and a 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile/water-gradient. Detection uses electrospray, positive-mode ionization mass spectrometry. Between 10 (LOQ) and 1000 ng/mL, accuracy was 95.5-98.5% for ABT-888 and 91.4-100.9% for M8, and precision was 0.1-4.9% for ABT-888 and 0-13.7% for M8. The assay is being applied to samples generated in several clinical trials.
15996837	A case study of acute human chlorpyrifos poisoning: novel aspects on metabolism and toxicokinetics derived from liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of urine samples. The metabolic fate of the organophosphorothioate-type insecticide chlorpyrifos (CP) in an acutely intoxicated 59 years old female was investigated by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) analysis of urine samples. Fifteen metabolites of CP and its bioactivated intermediate chlorpyrifos-oxon (CPO), respectively, of which only three have been described in man so far, were identified on the basis of characteristic MS/MS transitions, precursor/product ion and/or neutral loss scans, chlorine isotopomer patterns, and partly by synthesis of reference compounds and subsequent structure confirmation. Three distinct biotransformation routes of CP are proposed: (1) cleavage reactions at the aromatic phosphoester bond, (2) cleavage reactions at the alkyl phosphoester bonds, and (3) glutathione (GSH) dependent nucleophilic substitution of the 6-chlorine at the aromatic moiety. Route (2) has not been reported in humans before and (3) is a hitherto completely unknown scheme of CP metabolism. Urinary markers of the latter were chiefly cysteine S-conjugates of mono-dechlorinated CP, CPO, mono-O-deethyl CP, and mono-O-deethyl CPO as well as the 6-mercapturic acid conjugate of 3,5-dichloro-2-pyridinol. The presence of 3,5-dichloro-6-methylthio-2-pyridinol as well as its O-glucuronide suggests further a cysteine S-conjugate beta-lyase mediated degradation. In addition to the qualitative LC-MS/MS screening the renal elimination profiles of the primary products of scheme (1), i.e. diethyl thiophosphate (DETP), diethyl phosphate (DEP), and 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP), were monitored over 14 days (n=21). A biphasic first-order excretion mechanism with half-lives of 21.5h (initial fast excretion phase) and 119.5h (terminal phase) for the sum of free DETP and DEP was found. TCP was hardly eliminated in its free form (O-glucuronide identified as phase II conjugate) and half-lives calculated for the total amount of TCP (acidic hydrolysis of urine samples) were 40.8 and 150.7h. The present study gives a more detailed view on the biotransformation of CP and together with the obtained kinetic data adds novel aspects to the limited knowledge of human metabolism of this xenobiotic, in particular at high dosage.
23482500	Sorafenib hepatobiliary disposition: mechanisms of hepatic uptake and disposition of generated metabolites. Sorafenib is an orally active tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of renal and hepatocellular carcinoma. This study was designed to establish whether transport proteins are involved in the hepatic uptake of sorafenib and to determine the extent of biliary excretion of sorafenib and its metabolites in human hepatocytes. Initial uptake was assessed in freshly isolated, suspended human hepatocytes in the presence of inhibitors and modulators. [(14)C]Sorafenib (1 µM) uptake at 4°C was reduced by about 61-63% of the uptake at 37°C, suggesting a high degree of passive diffusion. Hepatocyte uptake of [(14)C]sorafenib was not Na(+) dependent or influenced by the organic anion transporter 2 inhibitor ketoprofen. However, initial [(14)C]sorafenib hepatocyte uptake was reduced by 46 and 30% compared with control values in the presence of the organic anion transporting polypeptide inhibitor rifamycin SV and the organic cation transporter (OCT) inhibitor decynium 22, respectively. [(14)C]Sorafenib (0.5-5 µM) uptake was significantly higher in hOCT1-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells compared with mock cells, and inhibited by the general OCT inhibitor, 1-methyl-4-phenylpryidinium. OCT1-mediated uptake was saturable with a Michaelis-Menten constant of 3.80 ± 2.53 µM and a V(max) of 116 ± 42 pmol/mg/min. The biliary excretion index and in vitro biliary clearance of sorafenib (1 µM) in sandwich-cultured human hepatocytes were low (∼11% and 11 ml/min/kg, respectively). Results suggest that sorafenib uptake in human hepatocytes occurs via passive diffusion, by OCT1, and by organic anion transporting polypeptide(s). Sorafenib undergoes modest biliary excretion, predominantly as a glucuronide conjugate(s).
16085136	Stereospecific high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis of naringenin in urine. A method of analysis of naringenin [(+/-)-4',5,7-trihydroxyflavanone] in biological fluids is necessary to study the kinetics of in vitro and in vivo metabolism, tissue distribution in fruits and humans. A simple high-performance liquid chromatographic method was developed for simultaneous determination of naringenin enantiomers in rat and human urine. Urine (0.1 ml) was precipitated with cold acetonitrile after addition of the internal standard, daidzein. Separation was achieved on a Chiralcel OD-RH column with UV detection at 292 nm. The calibration curves were linear ranging from 0.5 to 100 microg/ml for each enantiomer. The mean extraction efficiency was >99%. Precision of the assay was <9.4% (CV), and was within 5.4% at the limit of quantitation (0.5 microg/ml). Bias of the assay was lower than 16%, and was within 15% at the limit of quantitation. The assay was applied successfully to the urinary excretion of naringenin in rats and humans.
18927241	Pharmacokinetics of novel atrial-selective antiarrhythmic agent vernakalant hydrochloride injection (RSD1235): influence of CYP2D6 expression and other factors. Vernakalant hydrochloride injection (RSD1235) is a relatively atrial-selective antiarrhythmic agent that converts atrial fibrillation rapidly to sinus rhythm. The pharmacokinetics of vernakalant were explored in healthy volunteers and in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter in 4 clinical studies. Key pharmacokinetic parameters analyzed were the maximum plasma concentration and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve. Vernakalant exhibited linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 0.1 mg/kg to 5.0 mg/kg in healthy subjects, and generally showed dose proportionality in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter who received 1 or 2 vernakalant infusions. Vernakalant was metabolized rapidly via 4-O-demethylation by cytochrome P450 (CYP)2D6 to its major metabolite RSD1385, which then circulated predominantly as an inactive glucuronide conjugate. In most patients, the maximum plasma concentration of RSD1385 glucuronide exceeded that of vernakalant. Unconjugated RSD1385 was found at low levels in all patients demonstrating either a cytochrome P450 CYP2D6 "extensive metabolizer" or "poor metabolizer" phenotype or genotype; however, CYP2D6 poor metabolizers had even lower levels of unconjugated RSD1385. The impact of CYP2D6 metabolizer status on vernakalant exposure was explored in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter who received a therapeutic regimen (3 mg/kg initially via 10-minute intravenous infusion followed by a second 2 mg/kg 10-minute infusion if atrial fibrillation persisted after a 15-minute observation period). In the subset that received 2 vernakalant infusions, there was little difference in vernakalant maximum plasma concentration or area under the plasma concentration-time curve from the start of the first infusion to 90 minutes between CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers or between those who did or did not receive concomitant CYP2D6-inhibitor medications. Gender, age, and renal function did not have a clinically significant influence on the pharmacokinetics of vernakalant. These results suggest that an assessment of CYP2D6 expression may not be needed when vernakalant is administered acutely and intravenously to patients with atrial fibrillation.
433310	The metabolism of benzyclane [1-benzyl-1-(3-N,N-dimethylaminopropoxy)cycloheptane] in rat and man. 1. Two metabolites, isolated from the urine of rats dosed with bencyclane fumarate, were characterized as cis-1-benzyl-1-(3-N,N-dimethylaminopropoxy)-4-hydroxycycloheptane (metabolite I) and 1-benzyl-1-(3-N,N-dimethylaminopropoxy)-4-oxocycloheptane (metabolite II). 2. Bencyclane and the two metabolites were determined in the urine of rats and volunteers by g.l.c. Metabolite I was a major metabolite in men, being excreted in urine to the extent of 23.5% dose in the first 24 h.
16376051	Simultaneous determination of erythromycin ethylsuccinate and its metabolite erythromycin in human plasma using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry for clinical study. A sensitive and selective liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) method was developed for simultaneous identification and quantification of erythromycin ethylsuccinate and erythromycin in human plasma, which can be well applied to clinical study. The method was based on liquid-liquid extraction, followed by a LC procedure with an ODS C18 column, and mixture of acetonitrile and 1.67 mmol/l acetic acid as mobile phase. MS detection was performed using a single quadrupole mass spectrometer in positive selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. The method was validated to be linear, precise and accurate. The lower limit of quantification of erythromycin ethylsuccinate and erythromycin were both 0.5 ng/ml. The proposed method enables the unambiguous identification and quantification of erythromycin ethylsuccinate and erythromycin for clinical drug monitoring.
15740074	Degradation of neohesperidin dihydrochalcone by human intestinal bacteria. The degradation of neohesperidin dihydrochalcone by human intestinal microbiota was studied in vitro. Human fecal slurries converted neohesperidin dihydrochalcone anoxically to 3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)propionic acid or 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)propionic acid. Two transient intermediates were identified as hesperetin dihydrochalcone 4'-beta-d-glucoside and hesperetin dihydrochalcone. These metabolites suggest that neohesperidin dihydrochalcone is first deglycosylated to hesperetin dihydrochalcone 4'-beta-d-glucoside and subsequently to the aglycon hesperetin dihydrochalcone. The latter is hydrolyzed to the corresponding 3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)propionic acid and probably phloroglucinol. Eubacterium ramulus and Clostridium orbiscindens were not capable of converting neohesperidin dihydrochalcone. However, hesperetin dihydrochalcone 4'-beta-d-glucoside was converted by E. ramulus to hesperetin dihydrochalcone and further to 3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)propionic acid, but not by C. orbiscindens. In contrast, hesperetin dihydrochalcone was cleaved to 3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)propionic acid by both species. The latter reaction was shown to be catalyzed by the phloretin hydrolase from E. ramulus.
22846898	Fenproporex and amphetamine pharmacokinetics in oral fluid after controlled oral administration of fenproporex. Fenproporex hydrochloride (FEN) is an anorectic drug used in the treatment of obesity, and its major metabolite is amphetamine (AMP), another central nervous system stimulant. The concentration versus time profile of FEN and its metabolite AMP has been described in classic biological matrices such as plasma and urine; however, there are no reports of such data in oral fluid. The aim of this study is to describe the pharmacokinetics of FEN and AMP in oral fluid after intake of FEN. Twenty-five milligrams of FEN (1 capsule of Desobesi-m) was orally administered to 6 male volunteers, and oral fluid samples were collected with a Quantisal device during 24.00 hours after drug ingestion. These samples were submitted to solid-phase microextraction before analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in the selected-ion-monitoring mode, using deuterium-labeled AMP as internal standard. After FEN administration, both analytes could be detected in oral fluid of all volunteers with an initial detection time varying from 0.50 to 1.00 hour. FEN peak concentrations occurred between 1.00 and 1.50 hours after administration and were between 70.7 and 227.5 μg/L. For AMP, peak concentration occurred between 1.50 and 4.00 hours, reaching 33.0-150.9 μg/L. The authors observed that oral administration of FEN resulted in significant amounts of FEN and AMP in oral fluid, showing that oral fluid could be a biological matrix suitable for pharmacokinetic studies for both analytes. Using a compartmental approach, FEN data were best fitted by 1-compartment model with first-order input and output, whereas AMP followed a 2-compartment model with first-order input and output.
17192499	Dose-proportional intraindividual single- and repeated-dose pharmacokinetics of roflumilast, an oral, once-daily phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor. The dose-proportional, intraindividual, single- and repeated-dose pharmacokinetics of roflumilast, an oral, once-daily phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor under investigation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, was investigated in healthy subjects. In an open, randomized, 2-period, 2-sequence crossover study, 15 subjects received immediate-release tablets of roflumilast 250 or 500 microg as single (day 1) and as repeated, once-daily doses for 8 days (days 5-12). Dose-adjusted point estimates and 90% confidence intervals of test (500 microg)/reference (250 microg) ratios for AUC and Cmax of roflumilast and its pharmacologically active N-oxide metabolite after single and repeated dosing were all within the standard equivalence acceptance range (0.80, 1.25) indicating dose proportionality. The pharmacokinetic properties of both roflumilast dosage forms provide clinically relevant evidence of predictable, intraindividual total (AUC) and maximum (Cmax) exposure of roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide. Repeated oral dosing with roflumilast 250 and 500 microg once daily was well tolerated.
12021633	Simple method based on fluorescent detection for the determination of 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide in plasma. Cyclophosphamide is a prodrug used both as a single drug and in combination chemotherapy. Cyclophosphamide is converted to its active metabolite (4-hydroxycyclophosphamide) by the cytochrome P450 enzymes. A liquid chromatography method including liquid-liquid extraction and protein precipitation in one step was developed to measure 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide in plasma. The 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide was stabilized and converted to a fluorescent dansylhydrazone derivative, which was chromatographed on a reverse-phase column and detected using a spectrofluorometric detector at excitation of 350 nm and emission of 550 nm. The limit of quantitation was 60 ng/mL and the between-day accuracy and precision were less than 9%. The method was applied to the analysis of plasma from patients who had received an intravenous infusion of 1 g/m(2) cyclophosphamide.
17698842	Characterization of the metabolic activation of hepatitis C virus nucleoside inhibitor beta-D-2'-Deoxy-2'-fluoro-2'-C-methylcytidine (PSI-6130) and identification of a novel active 5'-triphosphate species. beta-D-2'-Deoxy-2'-fluoro-2'-C-methylcytidine (PSI-6130) is a potent inhibitor of hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication in the subgenomic HCV replicon system, and its corresponding 5'-triphosphate is a potent inhibitor of the HCV RNA polymerase in vitro. In this study the formation of PSI-6130-triphosphate was characterized in primary human hepatocytes. PSI-6130 and its 5'-phosphorylated derivatives were identified, and the intracellular concentrations were determined. In addition, the deaminated derivative of PSI-6130, beta-d-2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-2'-C-methyluridine (RO2433, PSI-6026) and its corresponding phosphorylated metabolites were identified in human hepatocytes after incubation with PSI-6130. The formation of the 5'-triphosphate (TP) of PSI-6130 (PSI-6130-TP) and RO2433 (RO2433-TP) increased with time and reached steady state levels at 48 h. The formation of both PSI-6130-TP and RO2433-TP demonstrated a linear relationship with the extracellular concentrations of PSI-6130 up to 100 mum, suggesting a high capacity of human hepatocytes to generate the two triphosphates. The mean half-lives of PSI-6130-TP and RO2433-TP were 4.7 and 38 h, respectively. RO2433-TP also inhibited RNA synthesis by the native HCV replicase isolated from HCV replicon cells and the recombinant HCV polymerase NS5B with potencies comparable with those of PSI-6130-TP. Incorporation of RO2433-5'-monophosphate (MP) into nascent RNA by NS5B led to chain termination similar to that of PSI-6130-MP. These results demonstrate that PSI-6130 is metabolized to two pharmacologically active species in primary human hepatocytes.
22004675	Determination of sunitinib and its active metabolite N-desethylsunitinib in sweat of a patient. Skin reactions are side effects of sunitinib therapy with an adverse impact on quality of life often necessitating dose reductions. For conventional antineoplastic agents, such as doxorubicin, previous studies have indicated a possible relationship between sweat excretion and the development of skin toxicity. However, the determination of sunitinib and its active metabolite in sweat has not yet been reported. A sensitive and accurate method for the determination of sunitinib and its active metabolite N-desethylsunitinib in human sweat was developed using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry detection (LC-MS-MS). Sweat samples of a patient treated with sunitinib were collected using Pharmchek™ Drugs of Abuse patches to determine cumulative amounts of sunitinib and metabolite. Validation of the LC-MS-MS method was performed over a range from 1.0 to 200 ng/patch with good intra- and interassay accuracies for sunitinib and N-desethylsunitinib. Ranges of 76-119 and 7.9-10.5 ng/patch for cumulative secretion of sunitinib and metabolite, respectively, were found in patient samples. To our knowledge, this is the first method for determination of cumulative secretion of sunitinib and N-desethylsunitinib in human sweat samples. Sunitinib and its metabolite were easily detectable in sweat patches of a patient treated with sunitinib.
18778087	Identification of cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of the designer drugs N-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)-3-ethoxypropanamine and N-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)-3-methoxypropanamine. The involvement of human hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (P450s) in the metabolism of the designer drugs N-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)-3-ethoxypropanamine (PCEPA) and N-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)-3-methoxypropanamine (PCMPA) to the common metabolite N-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)-3-hydroxypropanamine (PCHPA) was studied using insect cell microsomes with cDNA-expressed human P450s and human liver microsomes (HLMs). Incubation samples were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Among the tested isoenzymes, P450 2B6, P450 2C19, P450 2D6, and P450 3A4 catalyzed PCEPA O-deethylation, and P450 2B6, P450 2C19, and P450 2D6 catalyzed PCMPA O-demethylation. According to the relative activity factor approach, these enzymes accounted for 22, 3, 30, and 45% of the net clearance for PCEPA and 51, 8, and 40% of the net clearance for PCMPA, respectively. At 1 microM PCEPA, the chemical inhibitors 4-(4-chlorobenzyl)pyridine for P450 2B6 and quinidine for P450 2D6 reduced metabolite formation in pooled HLMs by 37 and 73%, respectively, and at 10 microM PCEPA, they reduced metabolite formation by 57 and 26%, respectively. At 1 microM PCMPA, 4-(4-chlorobenzyl)pyridine and quinidine reduced metabolite formation in pooled HLMs by 25 and 39%, respectively, and at 10 microM PCMPA, they reduced metabolite formation by 62 and 27%, respectively. The experiments with the MAB inhibitory to P450 3A4 and the chemical inhibitor ketoconazole for P450 3A4 showed no inhibitory effect concerning PCEPA O-dealkylation. Experiments with HLMs from P450 2D6 poor metabolizers showed a reduction of metabolite formation as compared to pooled HLM of 73 and 25% (1 microM and 10 microM PCEPA) and 40 and 38% (1 microM and 10 microM PCMPA), respectively. In conclusion, the main metabolic step was catalyzed by different P450s.
17591678	Metabolism and disposition in humans of raltegravir (MK-0518), an anti-AIDS drug targeting the human immunodeficiency virus 1 integrase enzyme. Raltegravir is a potent human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) integrase strand transfer inhibitor that is being developed as a novel anti-AIDS drug. The absorption, metabolism, and excretion of raltegravir were studied in healthy volunteers after a single oral dose of 200 mg (200 microCi) of [(14)C]raltegravir. Plasma, urine, and fecal samples were collected at specified intervals up to 240 h postdose, and the samples were analyzed for total radioactivity, parent compound, and metabolites. Radioactivity was eliminated in substantial amounts in both urine (32%) and feces (51%). The elimination of radioactivity was rapid, since the majority of the recovered dose was attributable to samples collected through 24 h. In extracts of urine, two components were detected and were identified as raltegravir and the glucuronide of raltegravir (M2), and each accounted for 9% and 23% of the dose recovered in urine, respectively. Only a single radioactive peak, which was identified as raltegravir, was detected in fecal extracts; raltegravir in feces is believed to be derived, at least in part, from the hydrolysis of M2 secreted in bile, as demonstrated in rats. The major entity in plasma was raltegravir, which represented 70% of the total radioactivity, with the remaining radioactivity accounted for by M2. Studies using cDNA-expressed UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), form-selective chemical inhibitors, and correlation analysis indicated that UGT1A1 was the main UGT isoform responsible for the formation of M2. Collectively, the data indicate that the major mechanism of clearance of raltegravir in humans is UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation.
891590	Absorption and metabolism in man of 16-epi-gitoxin, a new semi-synthetic cardioactive glycoside. The pharmacokinetics of 3H-16-epi-gitoxin have been investigated after oral administration: The peak serum level occurred after 30-60 min, and its subsequent decline was in two phases with half-lives of 3.5 and 19.5 h, respectively. Within 3 days 66-70% of the administered radioactivity were eliminated by renal excretion. In the first 16 h 15% of excreted activity was in metabolites, but thereafter the glycoside was excreted in unchanged form. The metabolites were characterized by thin-layer chromatography and radio-scanning; it is assumed that they correspond to the bis- and monodigitoxosides as well as to the genin of 16-epi-gitoxin. The unusual pharmacokinetics of the glycoside are discussed in relation to its special kinetics at the molecular level, i.e. the rapid dissociation rate of the glycoside-(Na+ + K+)-ATPase-complex.
17565714	In vitro interaction cocktail assay for nine major cytochrome P450 enzymes with 13 probe reactions and a single LC/MSMS run: analytical validation and testing with monoclonal anti-CYP antibodies. A sensitive and rugged LC/MSMS method was developed for a comprehensive in vitro metabolic interaction screening assay with N-in-1 approach reported earlier. A cocktail consisting of ten cytochrome P450 (CYP)-selective probe substrates with known kinetic, metabolic and interaction properties in vivo was incubated in a pool of human liver microsomes, and metabolites of melatonin (CYP1A2), coumarin (CYP2A6), bupropion (CYP2B6), amodiaquine (CYP2C8) tolbutamide (CYP2C9), omeprazole (CYP2C19 and CYP3A4), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6), chlorzoxazone (CYP2E1), midazolam (CYP3A4) and testosterone (CYP3A4) were simultaneously analysed with a single LC/MSMS run. Altogether, 13 metabolites and internal standard phenacetin were analysed in multiple reaction mode. Polarity switching mode was utilized to acquire negative ion mode electrospray data for hydroxychlorzoxazone and positive ionization data for the rest of the analytes. Fast gradient elution was applied, giving total injection cycle of 8 min. The method was modified for two different LC/MSMS systems, and was validated for linear range, detection limit, accuracy and precision for each metabolite. In addition, cocktail inhibition system was further tested using monoclonal anti-CYP antibodies as inhibitors for each probe reaction.
2804433	The analysis and characterization of isomeric metabolites of temelastine by the combined use of thermospray liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. This paper describes the development and application of a combined thermospray liquid chromatographic/mass spectrometric and liquid chromatographic/tandem mass spectrometric method for distinguishing between five isomeric metabolites of Temelastine, comprising four hydroxylated metabolites and one N-oxide. The method allows the unambiguous characterization of all of the isomers either on their own or in the presence of each other. Clear results were obtained for the characterization of these metabolites in biological samples. Temelastine showed extensive phase I and phase II metabolism and the methodology was used to study the aglycone structures of the glucuronide conjugates derived from the hydroxylated metabolites. Photo-diode array ultraviolet spectroscopy was used as a complementary technique to help elucidate the site of glucuronidation in these species.
24136086	Disposition and metabolism of safinamide, a novel drug for Parkinson's disease, in healthy male volunteers. Absorption, biotransformation and elimination of safinamide, an enantiomeric α-aminoamide derivative developed as an add-on therapy for Parkinson's disease patients, were studied in healthy volunteers administered a single oral dose of 400 mg (14)C safinamide methanesulphonate, labelled in metabolically stable positions. Pharmacokinetics of the parent compound were investigated up to 96 h, of (14)C radioactivity up to 192/200 h post-dose. Maximum concentration was achieved at 1 h (plasma, median Tmax) for parent drug and at 7 and 1.5 h for plasma and whole blood (14)C radioactivity, respectively. Terminal half-lives were about 22 h for unchanged safinamide and 80 h for radioactivity. Safinamide deaminated acid and the N-dealkylated acid were identified as major metabolites in urine and plasma. In urine, the β-glucuronide of the N-dealkylated acid and the monohydroxy safinamide were also characterized. In addition, the glycine conjugate of the N-dealkylated acid and 2-[4-hydroxybenzylamino]propanamide were tentatively identified as minor urinary metabolites.
14743971	Interspecies variability and drug interactions of loxapine metabolism in liver microsomes. Loxapine is a dibenzoxazepine neuroleptic that is metabolized by the liver in humans. In the present study, we investigated first in vitro loxapine metabolism in liver microsomes from various species including rats, mice, guinea pigs, dogs, rabbits, monkeys and humans. This enables us to choose between species to further validate drug-drug interaction studies. We observed the formation of desmethyl- and hydroxy- metabolites of loxapine after incubation of the different species liver microsomes. Hydroxylation pathway was major in all species. Wide interspecies variability of loxapine metabolism was observed. Loxapine metabolism was similar in human, guinea pig and dog microsomes. We screened in vitro effects of 67 molecules, representative of 8 therapeutic classes, on loxapine metabolism. Loxapine (100 microM) was incubated with guinea pig liver microsomes (1 mg/ml) 30 min at 37 degrees C with and without the presence of interacting drug. We found that most of psychotropics (alimemazine, cyamemazine and levomepromazine), antifungal (ketoconazole), anticancer drugs (daunorubicin, pirarubicin) and analgesic (nefopam) inhibited more than 50% of hydroxyloxapine formation in vitro. Complementary clinical and pharmacokinetic studies should be performed to confirm these results.
14570773	Metabolism of rofecoxib in vitro using human liver subcellular fractions. The metabolism of rofecoxib, a potent and selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2, was examined in vitro using human liver subcellular fractions. The biotransformation of rofecoxib was highly dependent on the subcellular fraction and the redox system used. In liver microsomal incubations, NADPH-dependent oxidation of rofecoxib to 5-hydroxyrofecoxib predominated, whereas NADPH-dependent reduction of rofecoxib to the 3,4-dihydrohydroxy acid metabolites predominated in cytosolic incubations. In incubations with S9 fractions, metabolites resulting from both oxidative and reductive pathways were observed. In contrast to microsomes, the oxidation of rofecoxib to 5-hydroxyrofecoxib by S9 fractions followed two pathways, one NADPH-dependent and one NAD+-dependent (non-cytochrome P450), with the latter accounting for about 40% of total activity. The 5-hydroxyrofecoxib thus formed was found to undergo NADPH-dependent reduction ("back reduction") to rofecoxib in incubations with liver cytosolic fractions. In incubations with dialyzed liver cytosol, net hydration of rofecoxib to form 3,4-dihydro-5-hydroxyrofecoxib was observed, whereas the 3,4-dihydrohydroxy acid derivatives were formed when NADPH was present. Although 3,4-dihydro-5-hydroxyrofecoxib could be reduced to the 3,4-dihydrohydroxy acid by cytosol in the presence of NADPH, the former species does not appear to serve as an intermediate in the overall reductive pathway of rofecoxib metabolism. In incubations of greater than 2 h with S9 fractions, net reductive metabolism predominated over oxidative metabolism. These in vitro results are consistent with previous findings on the metabolism of rofecoxib in vivo in human and provide a valuable insight into mechanistic aspects of the complex metabolism of this drug.
8788139	Specific and sensitive determination of digoxin and metabolites in human serum by high performance liquid chromatography with cyclodextrin solid-phase extraction and precolumn fluorescence derivatization. A precolumn fluorescence derivatization high performance liquid chromatographic method has been developed for the simultaneous determination of digoxin and its metabolites digoxigenin bisdigitoxoside, digoxigenin monodigitoxoside digoxigenin, and dihydrodigoxin (20-R and 20-S epimers) in human serum. Digoxin and its metabolites were extracted from serum samples (containing digitoxin as internal standard) with a cyclodextrin solid-phase extraction (SPE) column. Fluorescent derivatives were formed by reaction of the analytes with 1-naphthoyl chloride in the presence of 4-dimethylaminopyridine under a nitrogen atmosphere in a glove box with controlled relative humidity (26% r.h. or less). The derivatives were isolated using cyclodextrin and C1 SPE columns sequentially, and determined by HPLC using silica column separation and fluorescence detection. Calibration curves were linear over the concentration range from 0.25 to 4.0 ng ml-1. Recoveries of digoxin and its metabolites from serum ranged from 62 to 86%, and coefficients of variation from repetitive analyses ranged from 6.9 to 20.9% and from 5.8 to 12.2% at 0.5 ng ml-1 and 2.0 ng ml-1, respectively. This method has been shown capable of specifically determining digoxin and its major metabolites in serum, and has been successfully used in the determination of digoxin and its metabolites in serum samples collected from patients undergoing digoxin therapy. This method thus permits the investigation of digoxin metabolism and pharmacokinetics after the administration of commercial dosage forms.
16939357	Identification of 4-methylspinaceamine, a pictet-spengler condensation reaction product of histamine with acetaldehyde, in fermented foods and its metabolite in human urine. Previous study demonstrated that 4-methylspinaceamine (4-methyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridine), a Pictet-Spengler condensation reaction product of histamine with acetaldehyde, is present in human urine. The current study sought to determine whether 4-methylspinaceamine is present in fermented foods; its presence might be expected since both histamine and acetaldehyde are often present in these foods. Soy sauce, fish sauce, cheese, and shao hsing wine (Chinese wine) were found to contain 4-methylspinaceamine. The concentration of 4-methylspinaceamine excreted in human urine was greatly elevated after ingestion of a meal containing soy sauce as a dietary source of 4-methylspinaceamine, demonstrating that the level of 4-methylspinaceamine in human urine was affected by dietary foods. In addition, a metabolite of 4-methylspinaceamine in human urine was investigated. An enhanced peak in the HPLC chromatogram of human urine samples after ingestion of 4-methylspinaceamine-containing foods was observed. A peak at the same retention time was also observed from a human urine sample after administration of 4-methylspinaceamine, suggesting that the peak was due to a metabolite. By comparison with the newly synthesized authentic compound, the metabolite was identified as 1,4-dimethylspinaceamine.
22406328	Toxicokinetics and lack of uterotropic effect of orally administered S-equol. S-equol is a natural product that is produced by the microbial biotransformation of daidzein, an isoflavone found in soy. Evidence suggests that the health benefits of soy may be related to one's ability to produce S-equol, thus S-equol is being developed for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women. The toxicokinetics of S-equol were evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats and cynomolgus monkeys; S-equol was rapidly absorbed with C(max) occurring between 0.5 h and 1.0 h in the rat and 3h in the monkey. AUC was linear over the doses tested with no differences between male and female animals. Conjugated S-equol was the major metabolite in plasma with less than 1% present as the unconjugated form. S-equol showed a weak induction of liver cytochrome P450s in vivo, and did not significantly inhibit the major human cytochrome P450s in vitro. S-equol was highly protein bound (>95%) in rat, monkey and man in a concentration-independent manner. Orally administered S-equol did not significantly change uterine weight or morphology in either the rat or monkey even at the highest doses tested. These studies show that S-equol has pharmacokinetic parameters suitable for drug development with a low potential for uterotropic effects.
24170778	Multiple cytochrome P450 isoforms are involved in the generation of a pharmacologically active thiol metabolite, whereas paraoxonase 1 and carboxylesterase 1 catalyze the formation of a thiol metabolite isomer from ticlopidine. Ticlopidine is a first-generation thienopyridine antiplatelet drug that prevents adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation. We identified the enzymes responsible for the two-step metabolic bioactivation of ticlopidine in human liver microsomes and plasma. Formation of 2-oxo-ticlopidine, an intermediate metabolite, was NADPH dependent and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, 2B6, 2C19, and 2D6 were involved in this reaction. Conversion of 2-oxo-ticlopidine to thiol metabolites was observed in both microsomes (M1 and M2) and plasma (M1). These two metabolites were considered as isomers, and mass spectral analysis suggested that M2 was a thiol metabolite bearing an exocyclic double bond, whereas M1 was an isomer in which the double bond was migrated to an endocyclic position in the piperidine ring. The conversion of 2-oxo-ticlopidine to M1 in plasma was significantly increased by the addition of 1 mM CaCl2. In contrast, the activity in microsomes was not changed in the presence of CaCl2. M1 formation in plasma was inhibited by EDTA but not by other esterase inhibitors, whereas this activity in microsomes was substantially inhibited by carboxylesterase (CES) inhibitors such as bis-(p-nitrophenyl)phosphate (BNPP), diisopropylphosphorofluoride (DFP), and clopidogrel. The conversion of 2-oxo-ticlopidine to M1 was further confirmed with recombinant paraoxonase 1 (PON1) and CES1. However, M2 was detected only in NADPH-dependent microsomal incubation, and multiple CYP isoforms were involved in M2 formation with highest contribution of CYP2B6. In vitro platelet aggregation assay demonstrated that M2 was pharmacologically active. These results collectively indicated that the formation of M2 was mediated by CYP isoforms whereas M1, an isomer of M2, was generated either by human PON1 in plasma or by CES1 in the human liver.
9300	The physiological disposition of etilefrine in man. Pharmacokinetic and metabolic studies with 3H-etilefrine were performed to assess the importance of a first-pass effect on the pharmacodynamic action of this sympathomimetic amine. Identical amounts of 3H-activity, ca. 80% of the dose, were excreted in the urine after intravenous or oral administration, which indicates complete enteral absorption of the drug. Comparison of the areas under the plasma curves of unchanged etilefrine after both routes of administration resulted in a bioavailability factor of 0.55, which can be explained by an extensive first-pass effect. The time curve of plasma levels of etilefrine was compatible with an open 2-compartment model characterized by a rather large volume of distribution (Vd, beta) of 160 1, and a predominant half life of 2 hours. The pharmacodynamic action corresponded to the amount of drug in the central compartment. The major pathway of metabolism of etilefrine was conjugation to form the phenolic sulphate, and a very minor proportion of the drug was excreted as the corresponding hydroxymandelic acid. This metabolic pattern seems to confirm our hypothesis that phenylalkylamines with hydroxyl group in the m-position of the benzene ring are predominantly conjugated in contrast to p-hydroxylated compounds which are mainly deaminated.
17409034	Analytical method for the quantitative determination of cyanuric acid as the degradation product of sodium dichloroisocyanurate in urine by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. A simple and selective analytical method for the quantitative determination of cyanuric acid, the degradation product of sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC), in human urine is reported herein. The sample preparation involved the use of diatomaceous earth extraction columns. Quantification was achieved by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry using negative ion electrospray with a cyano (CN) column. Between day relative standard deviation less than 10% (n=6) was obtained at the 5 mg L(-1) level. The assay was linear over the investigated range 0-20 mg L(-1) and the limit of detection (LOD) was confirmed to be 0.1 mg L(-1). The method was applied to monitoring levels of cyanuric acid in healthcare workers using disinfectants products containing NaDCC.
11477319	Removal of 10-hydroxycarbazepine by plasmapheresis. Removal of the oxcarbazepine metabolite 10-hydroxycarbazepine (MHD) by plasmapheresis was evaluated during a series of six plasmaphereses of a 13-year-old boy with Rasmussen encephalitis. Plasmapheresis was performed after steady-state concentrations of MHD had been achieved with a dose of 2550 mg oxcarbazepine daily. The mean amount of MHD removed per plasmapheresis was 78.9 mg (SD: 6.0 mg), representing 3% to 4% of the daily oxcarbazepine dose and approximately 5% to 6% of body stores of MHD. The mean steady-state trough MHD concentration was 33.3 mg/L (SD: 1.8 mg/L), and this was remarkably stable during the entire plasmapheresis period. The serum concentration of MHD was only mildly reduced by the procedure. The areas under the concentration curve of MHD on the first and sixth day of plasmapheresis were 99% and 94%, respectively, of the pre-plasmapheresis values. The results are in agreement with studies on other anticonvulsant medications (carbamazepine, valproic acid, phenobarbital, and phenytoin), indicating that minor fractions (2% to 10%) of body stores of these drugs are depleted during plasmapheresis. The authors conclude that it is unnecessary to adjust the oxcarbazepine dosage when performing single-volume plasma exchanges or even multiple exchanges during an extended period. It is further proposed that plasmapheresis is unlikely to be of therapeutic benefit in the treatment of an oxcarbazepine overdose.
18200575	Determination of terephthalic acid isopropylamide in urine with a liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) method. A sensitive and simple liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) method was developed for the determination of terephthalic acid isopropylamide, the final metabolite of procarbazine in human urine. A solid-phase extraction with C(18) cartridges was used followed by LC/MS with a single mass spectrometer (SSQ 7000 from Finnigan). Terephthalic acid isobutylamide was the internal standard. The quantification limit was 30 ng/mL in urine (6 x noise). This assay was applied for drug monitoring of terephthalic acid isopropylamide in urine after oral administration of procarbazine in children and adolescents with Hodgkin lymphomas.
17709305	In vitro metabolism of BYZX in human liver microsomes and the structural elucidation of metabolite by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method. In vitro phase I metabolism of BYZX, a novel central-acting cholinesterase inhibitor for the treatment of the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, was studied in human liver microsomes (HLM) and the metabolite formation pathways were investigated by chemical inhibition experiments and correlation analysis. The residual concentration of substrate and the metabolite formed in incubate were determined by HPLC method. The calibration curves of BYZX were linear over the concentration range from 5.07 microM to 200.74 microM. The relative standard deviations of within day and between day were less than 5% (n=5). The limit of detection (LOD) was 0.18 microg/mL (S/N=3) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.55 microg/mL (R.S.D.=5.2%, n=5). The determination recoveries of BYZX were in the range of 98.2-104.8%. The apparent K(m) of BYZX in HLM was 53.25+/-17.2 microM, the V(max) was 0.94+/-0.77 microM/min/mg protein, and the intrinsic clearance value (Cl(int)) was 0.018+/-0.02 mL/min/mg protein. Ketoconazole and cyclosporin A were the most potent inhibitors on BYZX metabolism in HLM with IC(50) being 0.89 microM and 18.17 microM, respectively. And the inhibition constant (K(i)) of ketoconazole was 0.42 microM. The metabolite of BYZX was N-des-ethyl-BYZX elucidated by LC-MS-MS. The results demonstrated that the developed HPLC method was reliability, simple technique, and was applicable to be used for the researches of in vitro metabolism of BYZX. CYP3A4 was the major isozyme responsible for BYZX metabolism; N-dealkylation was the major metabolic pathway of BYZX. The predominant metabolite of BYZX was N-des-ethyl-BYZX detected in vitro phase I metabolism in HLM.
16841959	Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism of haloperidol and reduced haloperidol to pyridinium metabolites. Haloperidol (HP) has been reported to undergo cytochrome P450 (P450)-mediated metabolism to potentially neurotoxic pyridinium metabolites; however, the chemical pathways and specific enzymes involved in these reactions remain to be identified. The aims of the current study were to (i) fully identify the cytochrome P450 enzymes capable of metabolizing HP to the pyridinium metabolite, 4-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-oxobutylpyridinium (HPP(+)), and reduced HP (RHP) to 4-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-hydroxybutylpyridinium (RHPP(+)); and (ii) determine whether 4-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-oxobutyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (HPTP) and 4-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-hydroxybutyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (RHPTP) were metabolic intermediates in these pathways. In vitro studies were conducted using human liver microsomal preparations and recombinant human cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s 1A1, 1A2, 1B1, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19 2D6, 2E1, 3A4, 3A5, and 3A7) expressed in bicistronic format with human NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase in Escherichia coli membranes. Pyridinium formation from HP and RHP was highly correlated across liver preparations, suggesting the same enzyme or enzymes were responsible for both reactions. Cytochrome P450s 3A4, 3A5, and 3A7 were the only recombinant enzymes which demonstrated significant catalytic activity under optimized conditions, although trace levels of activity could be catalyzed by NADPH-P450 reductase alone. NADPH-P450 reductase-mediated activity was inhibited by reduced glutathione but not catalase or superoxide dismutase, suggesting O(2)-dependent oxidation. No evidence was obtained to support the contention that HPTP and RHPTP are intermediates in these pathways. K(m) values for HPP(+) (34 +/- 5 microM) and RHPP(+) (64 +/- 4 microM) formation by recombinant P450 3A4 agreed well with those obtained with human liver microsomes, consistent with P450 3A4 being the major catalyst of pyridinium metabolite formation in human liver.
16720684	N-glucuronidation of perfluorooctanesulfonamide by human, rat, dog, and monkey liver microsomes and by expressed rat and human UDP-glucuronosyltransferases. N-Alkylperfluorooctanesulfonamides have been used in a range of industrial and commercial applications. Perfluorooctanesulfonamide (FOSA) is a major metabolite of N-alkylperfluorooctanesulfonamides and has a long half-life in animals and in the environment and is biotransformed to FOSA N-glucuronide. The objective of this study was to identify and characterize the human and experimental animal liver UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) that catalyze the N-glucuronidation of FOSA. The results showed that pooled human liver and rat liver microsomes had high N-glucuronidation activities. Expressed rat UGT1.1, UGT2B1, and UGT2B12 in HK293 cells catalyzed the N-glucuronidation of FOSA but at rates that were lower than those observed in rat liver microsomes. Of the 10 expressed human UGTs (1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 1A6, 1A9, 2B4, 2B7, 2B15, and 2B17) studied, only hUGT2B4 and hUGT2B7 catalyzed the N-glucuronidation of FOSA. The kinetics of N-glucuronidation of FOSA by rat liver microsomes and by hUGT2B4/7 was consistent with a single-enzyme Michaelis-Menten model, whereas human liver microsomes showed sigmoidal kinetics. These data show that rat liver UGT1.1, UGT2B1, and UGT2B12 catalyze the N-glucuronidation of FOSA, albeit at low rates, and that hUGT2B4 and hUGT2B7 catalyze the N-glucuronidation of FOSA.
12088722	Evaluation of [76Br]FBAU 3',5'-dibenzoate as a lipophilic prodrug for brain imaging. [76Br]FBAU is a potential PET tracer for assessing proliferation. This study proposes that [76Br]FBAU 3',5'-dibenzoate has higher blood-brain-barrier permeability than [76Br]FBAU itself and thus might be better suited for applications in the brain. The brain uptake indexes of the two compounds measured after carotid injection (29.6 +/- 13.9 for [76Br]FBAU 3',5'-dibenzoate, versus 10.0 +/- 8.7 for [76Br]FBAU) support this claim. Biodistribution study also showed that the brain accumulation of activity was higher in rats injected with [76Br]FBAU 3',5'-dibenzoate than with [76Br]FBAU (0.119+/-0.023 DUR at 1 h, versus 0.061 +/- 0.006). [76Br]FBAU 3',5'-dibenzoate was relatively stable in rat plasma, gradually being hydrolyzed to [76Br]FBAU exponentially with a calculated half-life of 0.8 h. DNA incorporation of [76Br]FBAU was also confirmed. The results presented support the hypothesis that the 3',5'-dibenzoate can act as a prodrug for FBAU and deliver more radiolabeled nucleoside to the brain.
8888283	Metabolism of quinine in children with global malnutrition. Malnutrition and malaria are two important public health problems in Africa. Quinine is one of the major treatments of chloroquine-resistant malaria. Although some authors have shown that quinine clearance is decreased in kwashiorkor, this type of malnutrition is caused by protein deficiency that differs from global protein-energy malnutrition. In rats, hepatic metabolism of many drugs is decreased in protein deficiency and increased in global food restriction. Several studies have found that human hepatic metabolism of many drugs is decreased in kwashiorkor, but, as yet, no study has focused on human global energy-protein malnutrition. Thus, as quinine is a drug with a narrow therapeutic index, we compared the pharmacokinetics of quinine in two groups. One group included children with global malnutrition and the other was a control group of children with normal nutrition. Volume of distribution and plasma concentrations of unbound quinine did not differ between children with global malnutrition and children with normal nutritional status. Clearance was significantly faster, half-life shorter, and concentrations, 12 h after the beginning of treatment, lower in malnourished children compared with control subjects. The ratio between area under the curve of hydroxyquinine (metabolite of quinine in man) and area under the curve of quinine was significantly increased in malnourished children and correlated with mid-arm/ head circumference ratio (marker of malnutrition in children). Thus, as metabolism of quinine is increased in children with global malnutrition, we suggest that the administration interval should be reduced in these children to obtain the same plasma concentrations of quinine found in normally nourished children. A safe and effective dosing strategy is postulated.
12920162	Isoform selectivity and kinetics of morphine 3- and 6-glucuronidation by human udp-glucuronosyltransferases: evidence for atypical glucuronidation kinetics by UGT2B7. Morphine elimination involves UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) catalyzed conjugation with glucuronic acid to form morphine 3- and 6-glucuronides (M3G and M6G, respectively). It has been proposed that UGT2B7 is the major enzyme involved in these reactions, but there is evidence to suggest that other isoforms also catalyze morphine glucuronidation in man. Thus, we have characterized the selectivity and kinetics of M3G and M6G formation by recombinant human UGTs. UGT 1A1, 1A3, 1A6, 1A8, 1A9, 1A10, and 2B7 all catalyzed M3G formation, but only UGT2B7 formed M6G. The kinetics of M3G formation by the UGT1A family isoforms was consistent with a single enzyme Michaelis-Menten model, with apparent Km values ranging from 2.6 to 37.4 mM. In contrast, M3G and M6G formation by UGT2B7 exhibited atypical kinetics. The atypical kinetics may be described by a model with high- and low-affinity Km values (0.42 and 8.3 mM for M3G, and 0.97 and 7.4 mM for M6G) from fitting to a biphasic Michaelis-Menten model. However, a multisite model with an interaction between two identical binding sites in a negative cooperative manner provides a more realistic approach to modeling these data. According to this model, the respective binding affinities (Ks) for M3G and M6G were 1.76 and 1.41 mM, respectively. These data suggest that M6G formation may be used as a selective probe for UGT2B7 activity, and morphine glucuronidation by UGT2B7 appears to involve the simultaneous binding of two substrate molecules, highlighting the need for careful analysis of morphine glucuronidation kinetics in vitro.
11719726	Ritonavir increases loperamide plasma concentrations without evidence for P-glycoprotein involvement. The antidiarrheal drug loperamide is frequently used to treat ritonavir-associated diarrhea in patients with human immunodeficiency virus. The absence of marked central opioid effects has been attributed to its low bioavailability and its poor penetration of the blood-brain barrier, both of which might be altered by ritonavir, a potent P-glycoprotein and cytochrome P4503A inhibitor. A 16-mg dose of loperamide was administered to 12 healthy male and female volunteers together with either 600 mg of ritonavir or placebo. Detailed pharmacokinetics of loperamide and its metabolites were determined over 72 hours. Central opioid effects were measured by evaluation of pupil diameter, cold pressor test, and transcutaneous PCO2 and PO2. Ritonavir caused a major pharmacokinetic interaction, increasing the area under the concentration-time curve of loperamide from 104 +/- 60 h x pmol/ml after placebo to 276 +/- 68 h. pmol/ml and delayed formation of the major metabolite desmethylloperamide (time to reach maximum concentration after drug administration [t(max)], 7.1 +/- 2.6 hours versus 19.6 +/- 9.1 hours). The urinary metabolic ratio of loperamide increased 3 times whereas the total molar amount of loperamide and metabolites excreted in urine remained unchanged. No central pharmacodynamic effects were observed after coadministration of loperamide with either ritonavir or placebo. This study demonstrates a major metabolic interaction probably by cytochrome P4503A4 with no evidence of P-glycoprotein involvement. This might explain the lack of central effects after ritonavir.
20384393	Effects of varying degrees of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine: analysis of a single-dose phase I study and pooled steady-state data from phase II/III trials. Duloxetine is indicated for patients with a variety of conditions, and some of these patients may have mild to moderate degrees of renal impairment. Renal impairment may affect the pharmacokinetics of a drug by causing changes in absorption, distribution, protein binding, renal excretion or nonrenal clearance. As duloxetine is highly bound to plasma proteins and its metabolites are renally excreted, it is prudent to evaluate the effect of renal insufficiency on exposure to duloxetine and its metabolites in the systemic circulation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of varying degrees of renal impairment on duloxetine pharmacokinetics in a single-dose phase I study and using pooled steady-state pharmacokinetic data from phase II/III trials. In the phase I study, a single oral dose of duloxetine 60 mg was given to 12 subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and 12 matched healthy control subjects. In the phase II/III trials (n = 463 patients), duloxetine 20-60 mg was given as once- or twice-daily doses. Duloxetine and metabolite concentrations in plasma were determined using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Noncompartmental methods (phase I: duloxetine and its metabolites) and population modelling methods (phase II/III: duloxetine) were used to analyse the pharmacokinetic data. The maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of duloxetine were approximately 2-fold higher in subjects with ESRD than in healthy subjects, which appeared to reflect an increase in oral bioavailability. The C(max) and AUC of two major inactive conjugated metabolites were as much as 2- and 9-fold higher, respectively, reflecting reduced renal clearance of these metabolites. Population pharmacokinetic results indicated that mild or moderate renal impairment, assessed by creatinine clearance (CL(CR)) calculated according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula, did not have a statistically significant effect on pharmacokinetic parameters of duloxetine. Values for the apparent total body clearance of duloxetine from plasma after oral administration (CL/F) in subjects with ESRD were similar to CL/F values in patients with normal renal function or with mild or moderate renal impairment. Dose adjustments for duloxetine are not necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CL(CR) > or =30 mL/min). For patients with ESRD or severe renal impairment (CL(CR) <30 mL/min), exposures of duloxetine and its metabolites are expected to increase; therefore, duloxetine is not generally recommended for these patients.
8049151	Lignans and flavonoids inhibit aromatase enzyme in human preadipocytes. Lignans and flavonoids are naturally-occurring diphenolic compounds found in high concentrations in whole grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables. Seven lignans and six flavonoids were evaluated for their abilities to inhibit aromatase enzyme activity in a human preadipose cell culture system. The lignan, enterolactone (Enl) and its theoretical precursors, 3'-demethoxy-3O-demethylmatairesinol (DMDM) and didemethoxymatairesinol (DDMM) decreased aromatase enzyme activity, with Ki values of 14.4, 5.0 and 7.3 microM, respectively. The flavonoids, coumestrol, luteolin and kaempferol also decreased aromatase enzyme activity, with Ki values of 1.3, 4.8 and 27.2 microM, respectively. Aminoglutethimide, a pharmaceutical aromatase inhibitor, showed a Ki value of 0.5 microM. Kinetic studies showed the inhibition by all compounds to be competitive. Smaller decreases in aromatase activity were observed with the lignan, enterodiol (End) and its theoretical precursors, O-demethylsecoisolariciresinol (ODSI), demethoxysecoisolariciresinol (DMSI) and didemethylsecoisolariciresinol (DDSI). The flavonoids, O-demethylangolensin (O-Dma), fisetin and morin showed no inhibitory effects. The inhibition of human preadipocyte aromatase activity by lignans and flavonoids suggests a mechanism by which consumption of lignan- and flavonoid-rich plant foods may contribute to reduction of estrogen-dependent disease, such as breast cancer.
18322074	Identification of human liver cytochrome P450 isoforms involved in autoinduced metabolism of the antiangiogenic agent (Z)-5-[(1,2-dihydro-2-oxo-3H-indol-3-ylidene)methyl]-2,4-dimethyl-1H-pyrrole-3-propanoic acid (TSU-68). (Z)-5-[(1,2-Dihydro-2-oxo-3H-indol-3-ylidene)methyl]-2,4-dimethyl-1H-pyrrole-3-propanoic acid (TSU-68) is a new anticancer drug that inhibits angiogenic receptor tyrosine kinases, which play a crucial role in tumor-induced vascularization. TSU-68 undergoes hepatic oxidation and glucuronidation. Incubation of TSU-68 with human liver microsomes in the presence of NADPH resulted in the formation of three major metabolites: 5-, 6-, and 7-hydroxyindolinone derivatives. The 5-, 6-, and 7-hydroxylation followed simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics with V(max)/K(m) values (an indicator of intrinsic clearance) of 13, 25, and 6 microl/min/mg, respectively. Of the 10 cDNA-expressed human cytochrome P450 isoforms examined, only CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 exhibited appreciable TSU-68 hydroxylation activity. Inhibition studies with alpha-naphthoflavone (a selective CYP1A2 inhibitor) and anti-CYP1A2 antibody also indicated the almost exclusive role of CYP1A2 in microsomal TSU-68 hydroxylation. Treatment of human hepatocytes with 10 microM TSU-68 resulted in a 28- to 140-fold increase in CYP1A1/2-mediated ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity. The protein levels of CYP1A2 were increased in TSU-68-treated hepatocytes, and those of CYP1A1, which were undetectable in control hepatocytes, were also increased to detectable levels in the TSU-68-treated hepatocytes. Thus, TSU-68 was shown to induce CYP1A1/2 expression, which was responsible for its hydroxylation. The observation that TSU-68 treatment resulted in a 10- to 45-fold increase in 5-, 6-, and 7-hydroxylation directly demonstrated the autoinduced hydroxylation of TSU-68. In conclusion, TSU-68 has the potential to cause induction of its own CYP1A1/2-mediated oxidative metabolism in humans. This autoinductive effect provides a clear explanation for the clinically observed decrease in TSU-68 plasma concentrations during repeated administration of the drug.
12125001	Validated assay for quantification of oxcarbazepine and its active dihydro metabolite 10-hydroxycarbazepine in plasma by atmospheric pressure chemical ionization liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Oxcarbazepine (OX), a new antiepileptic, may lead to unwanted side-effects or even life-threatening intoxications after overdose. Therefore, a validated liquid chromatographic/mass spectrometric (LC/MS) assay was developed for the quantification of OX and its pharmacologically active dihydro metabolite (dihydrooxcarbazepine, DOX, often named 10-hydroxycarbazepine). OX and DOX were extracted from plasma by the authors' standard liquid/liquid extraction and were separated on a Merck LiChroCART column with Superspher 60 RP Select B as the stationary phase. Gradient elution was performed using aqueous ammonium formate and acetonitrile. The compounds were quantified in the selected-ion monitoring mode using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization electrospray LC/MS. The assay was fully validated. It was found to be selective. The calibration curves were linear from 0.1 to 50 mg l(-1) for OX and DOX. Limits of quantification were 0.1 mg l(-1) for OX and DOX. The absolute recoveries were between 60 and 86%. The accuracy and precision data were within the required limits. The analytes in frozen plasma samples were stable for at least 1 month. The method was successfully applied to several authentic plasma samples from patients treated or intoxicated with OX. The measured therapeutic plasma levels ranged from 1 to 2 mg l(-1) for OX and from 10 to 40 mg l(-1) for DOX. The validated LC/MS assay proved to be appropriate for quantification of OX and DOX in plasma for clinical toxicology and therapeutic drug monitoring purposes. The assay is part of a general analysis procedure for the isolation, separation and quantification of various drugs and for their full-scan screening and identification.
22449546	Elucidation of the metabolic pathway of S-equol in rat, monkey and man. S-equol is a selective estrogen receptor β (ERβ) agonist which is produced in certain individuals after ingestion of its precursor daidzein, an isoflavone present in soy. S-equol is thought to provide certain health benefits, including reduced menopausal symptoms. The metabolic profile of S-equol was determined in vivo in Sprague-Dawley rats and cynomolgus monkeys, and in vitro using hepatocytes from rat, monkey, and human. High resolution MS fragmentation patterns indicated that the major metabolite of S-equol in rat plasma and urine was the 4'-glucuronide conjugate, with lesser amounts of unconjugated S-equol, the 7-sulfate conjugate, and the 4'-glucuronide-7-sulfate diconjugate. Monkeys also showed extensive metabolism, with the major species in plasma being the 4'-glucuronide and the 7-sulfate-4'-glucuronide diconjugate; urine contained primarily the 4'-glucuronide, as seen in the rat. In vitro metabolism by hepatocytes was extensive and similar in all species, with fragmentation patterns also indicating that the 4'-glucuronide was the major metabolite. No oxidative metabolites of [(14)C] S-equol were detected in either in vivo or in vitro studies. These findings show that glucuronidation is the primary pathway for the metabolism of S-equol in rat, monkey and man, and that all metabolic routes of S-equol observed in vitro were also observed in vivo.
9241660	The R144C change in the CYP2C9*2 allele alters interaction of the cytochrome P450 with NADPH:cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase. We have examined the kinetics of substrate metabolism by cDNA-expressed human CYP2C9 and the R144C variant. Both enzymes exhibited similar apparent K(m) values for (S)-warfarin 7-hydroxylation, diclofenac 4'-hydroxylation and lauric acid 11-hydroxylation. In contrast, the R144C variant (relative to CYP2C9) had slower rates of metabolism for all three substrates. The difference was most pronounced for (S)-warfarin. Surprisingly, the magnitude of the difference was found to be dependent on the cytochrome P450 to NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (OR) ratio in the system (the difference being more pronounced at higher OR to P450 ratios) implying that the R144C change affects interaction of the P450 with OR. The rates of (S)-warfarin 7-hydroxylation by CYP2C9 and the R144C variant also exhibited differential dependence on salt concentration which further supported a difference in interaction with OR. When OR was bypassed and the hydroxylation was supported by cumene hydroperoxide, no difference in the rates of diclofenac 4'-hydroxylation was observed for CYP2C9 and the R144C variant regardless of OR to P450 ratio. However, for (S)-warfarin 7-hydroxylation, some OR-dependence was maintained even when the reaction was supported by cumene hydroperoxide. Finally, we compared CYP2C9 activity and CYP2C9 protein levels for human lymphoblast expressed (high OR to P450 ratio) to human liver microsomes using immunoblotting and enzyme selective substrates. Human liver microsomal CYP2C9 and human lymphoblast-expressed CYP2C9 showed comparable amounts of activity per unit enzyme. This final observation indicates that the high OR to P450 ratio is the preferred model and predicts that the R144C change in human liver microsomal CYP2C9 should markedly reduce the rates of substrate metabolism. The implications of these observations for the interpretation of results with cDNA-expressed enzymes is discussed.
20109439	Stereospecific reduction of a potent kinesin spindle protein (KSP) inhibitor in human tissues. Compound A, 1-{(3R,3aR)-3-[3-(4-acetylpiperazin-1-yl)propyl]-7-fluoro-3-phenyl-3a,4-dihydro-3H-pyrazolo[5,1-c][1,4]benzoxazin-2-yl}ethanone, is a novel and potent inhibitor of the mitotic kinesin spindle protein. Metabolism studies with human hepatocytes showed that Compound A underwent significant ketone reduction to its biologically active metabolite M1. Here, we describe the studies that characterized the metabolic interconversion between Compound A and M1 in vitro in human tissues. LC-MS/MS analysis showed that the ketone reduction was stereospecific for M1 with no diastereomer of M1 detected in incubations with human hepatocytes. Interestingly, such stereospecific ketone reduction was not observed with Compound B, the enantiomer of Compound A. No reductive products were observed when Compound B was incubated with human hepatocytes. Studies with human liver subcellular fractions showed that Compound A was reduced to M1 primarily by human liver cytosol with little contribution from human liver microsomes and mitochondria. NADPH was the preferred cofactor for the reduction reaction. Reverse oxidation of M1 back to Compound A was also observed, preferentially in human liver cytosol with NADP(+) as the cofactor. The interconversion between Compound A and M1 in human liver cytosol was inhibited significantly by flufenamic acid and phenolphthalein (potent inhibitors for aldo-keto reductase 1Cs, p<0.05), but not by menadione, a selective inhibitor for carbonyl reductase. In addition to the liver, S9 from human lung and kidney was also capable of catalyzing this interconversion. Collectively, the results implicated the aldo-keto reductase 1Cs as the most likely enzymes responsible for the metabolic interconversion of Compound A and its active metabolite M1.
18506735	Characterization of a new norfloxacin metabolite monitored during a bioequivalence study by means of mass spectrometry and quantum computation. A bioequivalence study of two formulations containing norfloxacin was used for identification and assay of the metabolite of norfloxacin in human serum samples. The bioequivalence study was based on an analytical method using liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. The plasmatic profile of metabolite was similar to norfloxacin for both formulations. Three plasma fractions of norfloxacin metabolite from a volunteer were isolated by liquid chromatography and investigated by atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization mass-spectrometry. The structure of norfloxacin metabolite (7-aminoethylenamino-6-fluoro-4-hydroxy quinoline-3-carboxylic acid) was identified taking into account also the mass spectrometry investigations achieved for norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin (used as internal standard for the analytical method). A theoretical procedure based on quantum chemical calculations has been also used to explain the mass fragmentation in molecules of norfloxacin metabolite that differ from the molecule of norfloxacin.
14609655	Tissue distribution of lidocaine in critical care patients after intubation. We investigated tissue distribution of lidocaine in 33 patients after endotracheal intubation with Xylocaine jelly that contains 2% lidocaine hydrochloride. Blood levels of monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX), an active metabolite of lidocaine, were also determined. Five patients (Group A) were alive on arrival and six patients (Group B) resumed heartbeats after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The survival times for Groups A and B ranged from 3 to 72 h. The remaining 22 patients (Group C) did not survive cardiopulmonary arrest on arrival (CPAOA). Systemic distribution of lidocaine was measured in nine patients from Group C. The liver-to-kidney lidocaine ratios and cerebrum-to-cerebrospinal fluid lidocaine ratios were: Group A, 0.1-0.7 and 1.4-3.6, respectively; Group B, 0.2-0.8 and 1.2-2.3, respectively; Group C, 0.1-17 and 0.2-1.0, respectively. MEGX was detected in all blood samples from Group A and only two samples from Group B. No MEGX was detected in samples from Group C. Our results indicate that the absorption of tracheal lidocaine during natural circulation results in a cerebrum-to-cerebrospinal fluid lidocaine ratio of 1.2 or more, whereas absorption during artificial circulation by cardiac massage gives a ratio of 1.0 or less. The cerebrum-to-cerebrospinal fluid lidocaine ratio may be a more useful index to estimate circulatory dynamics of patients during CPR than the liver-to-kidney lidocaine ratio. MEGX was not a useful parameter for monitoring circulatory changes during cardiac massage.
17555643	Quantification of tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in whole blood. Here we describe a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for the blood determination of tricyclic antidepressant drugs (amitriptyline, clomipramine, trimipramine, and imipramine, doxepin, mianserin, maprotyline, dosulepine, amoxapine), their active metabolites (desipramine, nortriptyline, demethylclomipramine, and nordoxepin), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (toloxatone and moclobemide). A nontricyclic antidepressant (viloxazine) and two other anxiolytic drugs (buspirone and hydroxyzine) that could be encountered in toxicology have been included to this method. After a liquid-liquid extraction from blood, the compounds and their internal standard (methylrisperidone) were eluted on a XTerra RP18 column with a gradient of acetonitrile/ammonium formate buffer 4 mmol/L (pH 3.2). They were then detected by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry with multiple reaction monitoring mode. The calibration curves were linear over the range 5-100 ng/mL. The limit of quantification was 2 ng/mL for each compound. The bias were lower than 10%. Intraday and interday precisions, expressed as variation coefficient, were lower than 13%. The extraction recoveries were between 60 and 80% except for moclobemide, viloxazine, and toloxatone (10-60%). This specific and sensitive method allows management of intoxication and is suitable for the routine determination of antidepressants in forensic investigation.
8739811	Multiple-dose clinical pharmacology of the catechol-O-methyl-transferase inhibitor tolcapone in elderly subjects. The purpose of this study was to assess the multiple-dose clinical pharmacology of tolcapone, a novel catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor, in elderly subjects. The drug was administered orally t.i.d. for 7 days to four sequential groups of eight elderly subjects (gender ratio 1:1) at doses of 100, 200, 400 and 800 mg in a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, ascending-multiple-dose design. On days 2 and 7, a single dose of levodopa/benserazide 100/25 mg was given 1 h after the first intake of tolcapone. Plasma concentrations of tolcapone; its metabolite 3-O-methyltolcapone, levodopa and 3-O-methyldopa were determined during the course of the study in conjunction with COMT activity in erythrocytes. Tolcapone was well tolerated at all dose levels, with a slight increase in gastrointestinal adverse events in females at higher doses. The drug was rapidly absorbed and eliminated and showed no changes in pharmacokinetics with time during multiple doses of 100 and 200 mg t.i.d. At doses of 400 and 800 mg t.i.d., tolcapone accumulated moderately as reflected in increased Cmax and AUC values. Despite the long halflife of 3-O-methyltolcapone (39 h), only minor accumulation occurred due to suppression of its formation by tolcapone. The pharmacodynamics of tolcapone did not change during the week of treatment as reflected in inhibition of COMT activity in erythrocytes, the derived parameters of the plasma concentration-effect relationship (inhibitory Emax model with constant EC50 values) and the effect on levodopa pharmacokinetics (1.6 to 2.5-fold increase in bioavailability). This suggests the absence of tolerance development and the insignificance of the altered pharmacokinetics at 400 and 800 mg t.i.d. with regard to the pharmacodynamics. The results of this study offer promising perspectives for the application of tolcapone as adjunct therapy to levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
21783974	Phthalate metabolites in urine of CF patients are associated with use of enteric-coated pancreatic enzymes. In metabolomic studies using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry of urine from children with cystic fibrosis (CF), high levels of metabolites of low molecular weight phthalates were found. Phthalate metabolite excretion was explained by therapy with enteric-coated pancreatic enzyme replacements. Phthalate metabolite identity was confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry. Pancreatic insufficient CF children taking Cotazym ECS(®), which is formulated with diethyl phthalate (DEP), had urinary metabolites of DEP. Children taking Creon(®), which has dibutyl phthalate (DBP), excreted DBP metabolites. The estimated concentrations of free MEP were 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than reported from environmental phthalate exposure. Enteric-coated pancreatic enzymes can expose individuals with CF to incessant, high oral intakes of phthalates. Although adverse effects have neither been shown to be present nor absent, we raise the need to consider that individuals requiring life-long therapy with some current pancreatic enzyme replacements chronically ingest high amounts of phthalates.
7839702	Metabolism of [3-14C] coumarin by human liver microsomes. 1. The metabolism of 50 microM [3-14C] coumarin has been studied in a panel of 12 human liver microsomal samples of known P450 isoenzyme profile. 2. [3-14C] coumarin was metabolized by human liver microsomes to various polar products including 3-, 4- and 7-hydroxycoumarins (3-HC, 4-HC and 7-HC) 6,7-dihydroxycoumarin (6,7-DiHC), o-coumaric acid (o-CA), o-hydroxyphenyl-acetaldehyde (o-HPA), o-hydroxyphenylethanol (o-HPE), o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (o-HPAA) and o-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid (o-HPPA) and to product(s) that bind covalently to microsomal proteins. 3. For all 12 subjects, mean rates of [3-14C] coumarin metabolism to total polar products (metabolism to all products except product(s) covalently bound to microsomal proteins), 7-HC, the 3-hydroxylation pathway (sum of 3-HC, o-HPA, o-HPE and o-HPAA), o-HPPA, 6,7-DiHC and covalent binding were 1420, 1230, 73.8, 52.5, 9.5 and 4.8 pmol/min/mg protein respectively. 4. Marked interindividual differences in [3-14C] coumarin metabolism to total polar products (30-fold variation) and 7-HC (2250-fold variation) were observed. 5. Good correlations were observed between [3-14C] coumarin metabolism and total polar products, 7-HC, o-HPPA and 6,7-DiHC, but not to 3-hydroxylation pathway products and levels of 2A6 and 2B6 in human liver microsomes. 6. [3-14C] coumarin metabolism to any polar products did not correlate with levels of 1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2E1, 3A3/4 and 4A1 in human liver microsomes.
17176624	Roflumilast, a once-daily oral phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, lacks relevant pharmacokinetic interactions with inhaled salbutamol when co-administered in healthy subjects. Roflumilast is an oral, once-daily phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor under investigation for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. In clinical practice, the drug is likely to be co-administered with inhaled bronchodilating beta2-adrenoceptor agonists. Therefore, this study investigated the pharmacokinetic characteristics of roflumilast and its pharmacodynamically active metabolite roflumilast N-oxide when co-administered with orally inhaled salbutamol in healthy subjects. In this open, randomized clinical study, 12 healthy male subjects received repeated doses of oral roflumilast 500 microg once daily, orally inhaled salbutamol 200 microg 3 times daily, and a combination of both drugs over 7 days according to a 3-period, changeover design with 14 days washout between treatments. Co-administration of roflumilast and salbutamol did not markedly change roflumilast or roflumilast N-oxide disposition. Point estimates (90% confidence intervals) of area under the curve from 0-24 h (AUC 0-24) and maximum plasma concentration in steady state (Cmax,ss) for roflumilast with salbutamol versus roflumilast alone were 1.05 (0.94, 1.17) and 0.97 (0.84, 1.10); the respective point estimates (90% confidence intervals) for AUC 0-24 and Cmax,ss of roflumilast N-oxide were 0.98 (0.91, 1.06) and 0.98 (0.92, 1.03). Roflumilast co-administration did not alter the pharmacokinetics of steady state salbutamol. The respective point estimates (90% confidence intervals) for AUC 0-6 and Cmax,ss of salbutamol with roflumilast versus salbutamol alone were 1.10 (0.99, 1.21), 1.08 (0.91, 1.28). The combination of both drugs was well tolerated. There were no relevant pharmacokinetic interactions between roflumilast and salbutamol at therapeutically effective doses.
21192313	Modulators of very low voriconazole concentrations in routine therapeutic drug monitoring. Very low voriconazole concentrations are commonly observed during therapeutic drug monitoring. Possible mechanisms include inappropriate dose selection, rapid metabolism (as a result of genetic polymorphisms or enzyme induction), and also nonadherence. We aimed to develop a method to distinguish between rapid metabolism of and nonadherence to voriconazole by quantification of voriconazole metabolites. In addition, the relevance of common genetic polymorphisms of CYP2C19 was assessed. In a retrospective study, samples with voriconazole concentrations 0.2 μg/mL or less in routine therapeutic drug monitoring (as quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography) were evaluated. Voriconazole and its N-oxide metabolite were quantified in residual blood using a highly sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy method (lower limit of quantitation = 0.03 μg/mL). Genetic polymorphisms of CYP2C19 were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction using the hybridization probe format and the polymerase chain reaction-random fragment length polymorphism format. A total of 747 routine therapeutic drug monitoring plasma/blood samples of 335 patients treated with systemic voriconazole were analyzed and in 18.7% of all samples, voriconazole concentrations 0.2 μg/mL or less were found. In 32 samples (30 patients) with adequate dosage and timing of blood withdrawal, nonadherence was strongly suspected in seven patients because voriconazole-N-oxide concentrations were below 0.03 μg/mL, which was not observed in a reference group of 51 healthy volunteers with controlled drug intake. In 10 patients, of whom EDTA blood was available, the ultrarapid metabolizer genotype (CYP2C19*1\*17, CYP2C19*17\*17) was found in 80% and its prevalence was significantly higher as compared to a reference group (P = 0.02). In conclusion, quantification of voriconazole-N-oxide allowed for detection of suspected nonadherence in one of four patients with very low voriconazole concentrations. In the remaining patients, ultrarapid metabolism resulting from the CYP2C19*17 polymorphism appears to play a major role. Thus, in the case of voriconazole therapy failure, both nonadherence and genetic factors have to be considered.
20076952	Effects of itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of intravenously and orally administered oxycodone. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP34A) inhibitor itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of orally and intravenously administered oxycodone. Twelve healthy subjects were administered 200 mg itraconazole or placebo orally for 5 days in a four-session paired cross-over study. On day 4, oxycodone was administered intravenously (0.1 mg/kg) in the first part of the study and orally (10 mg) in the second part. Plasma concentrations of oxycodone and its oxidative metabolites were measured for 48 h, and pharmacodynamic effects were evaluated. Itraconazole decreased plasma clearance (Cl) and increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-infinity) of intravenous oxycodone by 32 and 51%, respectively (P<0.001) and increased the AUC(0-infinity) of orally administrated oxycodone by 144% (P<0.001). Most of the pharmacokinetic changes in oral oxycodone were seen in the elimination phase, with modest effects by itraconazole on its peak concentration, which was increased by 45% (P=0.009). The AUC(0-48) of noroxycodone was decreased by 49% (P<0.001) and that of oxymorphone was increased by 359% (P<0.001) after the administration of oral oxycodone. The pharmacologic effects of oxycodone were enhanced by itraconazole only modestly. Itraconazole increased the exposure to oxycodone by inhibiting its CYP3A4-mediated N-demethylation. The clinical use of itraconazole in patients receiving multiple doses of oxycodone for pain relief may increase the risk of opioid-associated adverse effects.
15283301	Effect of gemfibrozil on the metabolism of pitavastatin--determining the best animal model for human CYP and UGT activities. A series of studies was conducted to determine the best animal model for human CYP and UGT activities. The investigation focused primarily on the interactions occurring in the CYP- or UGT-mediated metabolism of pitavastatin, and involved in vitro and in vivo experiments. We found that the best animal models for human CYP-mediated hydroxylation and UGT-mediated lactonization of pitavastatin were rats and dogs, respectively. In addition, a large difference in the metabolic properties of pitavastatin was found between monkeys and humans. In the presence of gemfibrozil, the CYP- or UGT-mediated metabolism of pitavastatin was inhibited in vitro. However, gemfibrozil treatment had no inhibitory effect on the AUC of pitavastatin and its lactone form in rats and dogs. We conclude that the plasma level of pitavastatin would not be increased by co-administration of gemfibrozil in humans.
22317789	Development and validation of LC-MS/MS methods for the determination of mirabegron and its metabolites in human plasma and their application to a clinical pharmacokinetic study. Mirabegron is being developed for the treatment of overactive bladder. To support the development of mirabegron, including pharmacokinetic studies, liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry methods for mirabegron and eight metabolites (M5, M8, M11-M16) were developed and validated for heparinized human plasma containing sodium fluoride. Four separate bioanalytical methods were developed for the analysis of: (1) mirabegron; (2) M5 and M16; (3) M8; and (4) M11-M15. Either solid-phase extraction or liquid-liquid extraction was used to extract the analytes of interest from matrix constituents. For mirabegron, an Inertsil C₈-3 analytical column was used and detection was performed using a triple-quad mass spectrometer equipped with an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization interface. For the metabolite assays, chromatographic separation was performed through a Phenomenex Synergi Fusion-RP C₁₈ analytical column and detection was performed using a triple-quad mass spectrometer equipped with a Heated Electrospray Ionization interface. The validation results demonstrated that the developed liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry methods were precise, accurate, and selective for the determination of mirabegron and its metabolites in human plasma. All methods were successfully applied in evaluating the pharmacokinetic parameters of mirabegron and metabolites in human plasma.
15847997	Synthesis, hydrolysis, and intraocular pressure lowering effects of fadolmidine prodrugs. The objective of this study was to synthesize and evaluate various esters of fadolmidine, a novel alpha2-adrenergic agonist, as potential ophthalmic prodrugs. All studied prodrugs released the parent drug (i.e., fadolmidine) quantitatively via enzymatic hydrolysis in 80% human serum. The pivalyl ester was considered to be the most promising prodrug in this series, due to its good chemical stability (pH 5.0; 37 degrees C; t(1/2)=310 days) and optimal lipophilicity (logP(app)=1.8; 1-octanol/phosphate buffer, pH 5.0), and was selected for further evaluation of its intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering effects in normotensive rabbits. The pivalyl ester showed increased IOP lowering ability when compared to an equimolar dose of fadolmidine, which was probably due to its increased lipophilicity and subsequent enhanced corneal penetration. The duration of action for the pivalyl ester was also longer than that of fadolmidine.
12642475	Cytochrome P450 2C8 and flavin-containing monooxygenases are involved in the metabolism of tazarotenic acid in humans. Upon oral administration, tazarotene is rapidly converted to tazarotenic acid by esterases. The main circulating agent, tazarotenic acid is subsequently oxidized to the inactive sulfoxide metabolite. Therefore, alterations in the metabolic clearance of tazarotenic acid may have significant effects on its systemic exposure. The objective of this study was to identify the human liver microsomal enzymes responsible for the in vitro metabolism of tazarotenic acid. Tazarotenic acid was incubated with 1 mg/ml pooled human liver microsomes, in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), at 37 degrees C, over a period of 30 min. The microsomal enzymes that may be involved in tazarotenic acid metabolism were identified through incubation with microsomes containing cDNA-expressed human microsomal isozymes. Chemical inhibition studies were then conducted to confirm the identity of the enzymes potentially involved in tazarotenic acid metabolism. Reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography was used to quantify the sulfoxide metabolite, the major metabolite of tazarotenic acid. Upon incubation of tazarotenic acid with microsomes expressing CYP2C8, flavin-containing monooxygenase 1 (FMO1), or FMO3, marked formation of the sulfoxide metabolite was observed. The involvement of these isozymes in tazarotenic acid metabolism was further confirmed by inhibition of metabolite formation in pooled human liver microsomes by specific inhibitors of CYP2C8 or FMO. In conclusion, the in vitro metabolism of tazarotenic acid to its sulfoxide metabolite in human liver microsomes is mediated by CYP2C8 and FMO.
18274957	In vitro metabolism of KBH-A40, a novel delta-lactam-based histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, in human liver microsomes and serum. 1. The metabolism of KBH-A40, a novel delta-lactam-based histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, was investigated in vitro using human liver microsomes and serum. After 60-min incubation in human liver microsomes with beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) or uridine diphosphate glucuronic acid (UDPGA), the residual KBH-A40 was 90.6% +/- 5.1% and 28.9% +/- 2.0% (t(1/2) = 26 min), respectively, suggesting that KBH-A40 is likely predominantly metabolized by glucuronidation, rather than by cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated oxidation. Consistently, KBH-A40 glucuronide was the only metabolite identified following incubations of KBH-A40 with human liver microsomes in the presence of both NADPH and UDPGA. 2. KBH-A40 was not notably degraded when incubated with human serum for 60 min. In contrast, KBH-A40 was rapidly hydrolysed to its carboxylic acid form in rat serum (t(1/2) = 13 min). 3. Taken collectively, the results suggest that KBH-A40 is likely metabolized in man predominantly by glucuronidation of its hydroxamic acid moiety, with negligible biotransformation elsewhere in the molecule.
4085522	Metabolism of the anti-depressant lortalamine. Humans excreted an oral dose of 5 mg of the anti-depressant lortalamine (radiolabelled with carbon-14) mainly in the urine (98% during 5 days). Plasma 14C concentrations were highest (about 44 ng equiv./ml) between 1.5-3 h when the corresponding concentrations of unchanged drug were about 17 ng/ml. Unchanged drug concentrations appeared to decline with a half-life of about 5 h. Concentrations of 14C then declined rapidly and were below the limits of detection (12 ng equiv./ml) at 24-36 h. Measurement of whole-blood 14C concentrations showed that there was some uptake into the blood cells (about 65% of the peak plasma 14C level). Radioactivity in the urine was mainly associated with unchanged drug and three metabolites. The major metabolite (about 50% urinary 14C) was identified by mass spectrometry as the N-demethylated compound and another metabolite as a keto derivative of lortalamine where oxidation had occurred in the piperidine ring.
22707166	In vitro metabolic fate of alizapride: evidence for the formation of reactive metabolites based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The study of the formation of reactive metabolites during drug metabolism is one of the major areas of research in drug development since the link between reactive metabolites and drug adverse effects was well recognized. In particular, it has been shown that acrolein, a reactive carbonyl species sharing carbonylating and alkylating properties, binds covalently to nucleophilic sites in proteins, causing cellular damage. Alizapride, (±)-6-methoxy-N-{[1-(prop-2-en-1-yl)-pyrrolidin-2-yl]methyl}-1H-benzotriazole-5-carboxamide, is a N-allyl containing dopamine antagonist with antiemetic properties for which no data concerning its metabolic fate are so far reported. The study of the in vitro metabolism of alizapride showed the formation of acrolein during the oxidative N-deallylation. Moreover, the formation of an epoxide metabolite has been also described suggesting its role as a putative structural alert. The reactivity of the acrolein and the epoxide generated in alizapride metabolism was demonstrated by the formation of the corresponding adducts with nucleophilic thiols. Overall, ten metabolites have been identified and characterized by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry analysis allowing to propose an in vitro metabolic scheme for alizapride. At the best of our knowledge, this is the second case of a drug involved in the generation of acrolein during its metabolism being the first represented by cyclophosphamide.
7485872	Lignocaine metabolite formation: an indicator for liver dysfunction and predictor of survival in surgical intensive care patients. Formation of the lignocaine metabolite monoethyl-glycine-xylidide (MEGX) by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes is a new method for evaluating liver function. The purpose of this study was to compare MEGX formation with other liver function parameters in surgical intensive care unit patients. The study include 29 critically ill patients who had been admitted to the unit for more than 3 days with a median APACHE III score-predicted mortality > 30%. On day 4, lignocaine was given intravenously at a dose of 1 mg.kg-1 over 2 min and MEGX formation was measured 15 min later. Eighty-nine percent of the patients had MEGX values below 90 micrograms.l-1 indicating impaired liver function. Eleven patients died, 18 patients survived. The group of patients with fatal outcome had significantly lower MEGX values (median: 23 micrograms.l-1) than the group of survivors (median: 53 micrograms.l-1, p < 0.01). Bilirubin values were elevated in the non-survivor group (median: 2.8 mg.dl-1) compared to the survivors (median: 0.9 mg.dl-1, p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between two groups in the other liver function tests. We conclude from our results that the MEGX test can be considered an indicator for hepatic dysfunction and predictor of survival in critically ill patients.
23239179	Measuring methotrexate polyglutamates in red blood cells: a new LC-MS/MS-based method. The folate antagonist methotrexate (MTX) is the anchor drug in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The therapeutic effects of MTX are attributed to the intracellular levels of MTX, present in the cell as polyglutamates (MTXPGn). We developed a new liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS)-based assay to separately quantitate MTXPGn in red blood cells using stable-isotope-labelled internal standards. Samples were analyzed by LC-ESI-MS/MS using a Waters Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column with a 5-100% organic gradient of 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 10) and methanol. The analysis consisted of simple sample preparation and a 6-min run time. Detection was done using a Waters Acquity UPLC coupled to a Waters Quattro Premier XE with electrospray ionization operating in the positive ionization mode. Assay validation was performed following recent Food and Drug Administration guidelines. The method was linear from 1-1,000 nM for all MTXPGn (R(2) > 0.99). The coefficient of variation ranged from 1-4% for intraday precision and 6-15% for interday precision. Samples were stable for at least 1 month at -80 °C. Recovery ranged from 98-100%, and the relative matrix-effect varied from 95-99%. The lower limit of quantitation was 1 nM for each MTXPGn. Fifty patient samples from the tREACH study were analyzed. The MTXPGn concentration and distribution of these samples were comparable with values reported in literature. The developed LC-ESI-MS/MS method for the quantitative measurement of MTXPGn in red blood cells is both sensitive and precise within the clinically relevant range. The method can be easily applied in clinical laboratories due to the combination of simple pre-treatment with robust LC-ESI-MS/MS.
15370962	Role of CYP3A enzymes in the biotransformation of triazolam in rat liver. 1. Triazolam (TRZ) has been used extensively in rat to evaluate its benzodiazepine agonist central nervous system effects. However, the pharmacokinetics of TRZ in the male rat are not well understood. 2. To characterize further TRZ biotransformation across species, the NADPH-dependent biotransformation of TRZ was examined in rat and human liver microsomes. The role of specific cytochrome P450s (CYPs) in the biotransformation of TRZ in the rat were also determined using both rat cDNA-expressed CYPs and chemical and antibody inhibition techniques. 3. The formation of TRZ's primary hydroxylated products, alpha-OH- and 4-OH-TRZ, was consistent with a single-enzyme Michaelis-Menten model in humans. 4. Although 4-OH-TRZ formation in the male rat liver was also approximated by a single-enzyme model, a second low-affinity component was identified as contributing to alpha-OH-TRZ formation in the rat. 5. The K(m) values for the primary metabolic pathway differed between the two species. However, the net intrinsic clearances were similar for the rat and human. 6. As observed previously for humans, chemical and antibody inhibition studies suggested that CYP3A enzymes contribute significantly to TRZ hydroxylation in the rat. This finding was further supported by the use of rat cDNA-expressed CYPs. 7. The male rat might serve as a useful model for evaluating mechanisms regulating TRZ metabolism in vivo.
11763000	The effect of CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 genotypes on the metabolism of clomipramine in Japanese psychiatric patients. In this study, the authors investigated the relationship between the metabolism of clomipramine (C) and the genotypes of cytochrome P450 (CYP) CYP2C19 and CYP2D6. Fifty-one Japanese patients (18 men and 33 women) were administered 10 to 250 mg/day of C by mouth and maintained on the same daily dose of C for at least 2 weeks to obtain steady-state concentrations. Plasma levels of C and its metabolites N-desmethylclomipramine (DC), 8-hydroxyclomipramine, and 8-hydroxy-N-desmethylclomipramine (HDC) were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The allele frequencies of CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*3, CYP2D6*5, and CYP2D6*10 were 27.5%, 12.8%, 2.9%, and 43.1%, respectively. Subjects who were homozygous for mutated alleles of CYP2C19 showed approximately 75% higher concentrations of C corrected by dose and body weight compared with those who were homozygous for wild-type alleles. Also, subjects who were homozygous for mutated alleles of CYP2C19 showed an approximately 68% higher value of C/DC compared with those who were homozygous for wild-type alleles. No significant difference in the ratio of DC/HDC was observed between subjects who were homozygous for mutated alleles of CYP2D6 and those who were homozygous for wild-type alleles. These results suggest that genotyping CYP2C19 is useful for grossly predicting the risk of getting high plasma concentrations of C and the low individual capacity to demethylate C because there is marked interindividual variability within each genotype. However, the genotyping of CYP2D6 is not useful for predicting the individual capacity to hydroxylate DC.
15337432	Acetylsalicylic acid as a potential regulator of prolidase-convertible pro-drugs in control and neoplastic cells. Proline analogue of melphalan (Mel-pro) is one of the pro-drugs activated by prolidase, cytoplasmic imidodipeptidase highly expressed in some neoplastic tissues. In order to limit the action of prolidase on the pro-drug in normal cells, prolidase inhibitor, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), was tested in fibroblasts (showing average prolidase activity for normal cells) and in MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells (showing elevated activity of the enzyme). The effect of Mel-pro in the presence and absence of ASA on prolidase activity (colorimetric assay), DNA biosynthesis (3H-thymidine incorporation assay), cytotoxicity (tetrazoline assay) and ability to penetrate cell membrane (thin layer chromatography) in both type of cells was measured. It has been found that 5 mM ASA significantly decreased conversion of Mel-pro to Mel in cultured fibroblasts as well as it decreased cytotoxicity and the effect of this drug on DNA synthesis. In contrast, 5 mM ASA had relatively lower effect on the conversion of Mel-pro into Mel in MDA-MB 231 cells as well it had little effect on Mel-pro-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell death. It suggests that ASA may serve as an inhibitor of prolidase-convertible pro-drugs in normal cells.
16751262	Structural characterization of anti-HIV drug candidate PA-457 [3-O-(3',3'-dimethylsuccinyl)-betulinic acid] and its acyl glucuronides in rat bile and evaluation of in vitro stability in human and animal liver microsomes and plasma. PA-457 [3-O-(3',3'-dimethylsuccinyl)-betulinic acid] represents a new class of anti-HIV drug candidates termed maturation inhibitors. After oral administration to rats, PA-457 was metabolized to several glucuronide conjugates and mainly eliminated into rat bile. Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry analysis showed that the glucuronidation products of PA-457 were acyl glucuronides including one di-glucuronide, di-PA-457G, and two mono-glucuronides, referred to as mono-PA-457G (I) and mono-PA-457G (II), respectively. In-source fragmentation of MS spectra supported the conclusion that mono-PA-457G (I) was glucuronidated at the C-28 carboxyl of PA-457, whereas mono-PA-457G (II) was conjugated at the dimethylsuccinic acid side chain of the C-3 position. Quantification demonstrated that the predominant glucuronide of PA-457 in rat bile was mono-PA-457G (I) with lower amounts of mono-PA-457G (II) and di-PA-457G. In vitro stability indicated that the mono-acyl glucuronides of PA-457 were not degraded after incubation with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 4, 7.4 and 9), plasma (human, rat, and mouse), and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase reaction media (without uridine 5'-diphosphoglucuronic acid) with microsomes (human, rat, and mouse liver microsomes), respectively, whereas the minor diglucuronide was unstable in rodent liver microsomes. All glucuronides of PA-457 could be hydrolyzed both by beta-glucuronidase and alkaline (1 M NaOH). Minor putative acyl migration products were slowly formed at pH 9, suggesting that the acyl glucuronides of PA-457 have relatively high in vitro stability.
11879354	Transplacental passage of oxcarbazepine and its metabolites in vivo. The purpose of this study was to investigate human fetal exposure to oxcarbazepine (OCBZ) in vivo. Transplacental passage and placental tissue concentrations of OCBZ and its metabolites were determined. Maternal venous blood, cord blood, and placental tissue samples from 12 mothers using OCBZ during pregnancy alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs were collected. Samples were analyzed with high-performance liquid chromatography. Maternal venous concentrations of OCBZ and its major metabolites were at same range as cord blood concentrations (OCBZ in maternal serum, 0.19 +/- 0.16 microg/ml, and in cord serum, 0.21 +/- 0.19 microg/ml; 10-hydroxy-10,11-dihydrocarbamazepine (10-OH-CBZ) in maternal serum, 5.69 +/- 2.49 microg/ml, and in cord serum, 5.23 +/- 1.44 microg/ml; 10,11-trans-dihydroxy-10,11-dihydrocarbamazepine (10,11-D) in maternal serum, 0.29 +/- 0.22 microg/ml, and in cord serum, 0.28 +/- 0.14 microg/ml). OCBZ (0.17 +/- 0.16 microg/g placental tissue), 10-OH-CBZ (3.49 +/- 1.34 microg/g placental tissue) and 10,11-D (0.25 +/- 0.11 microg/g placental tissue) were detected in the placental tissue. The amount of OCBZ detected from placental tissue was 0.01% of the daily dose. OCBZ, like other antiepileptic drugs, is transferred significantly through the placenta in humans.
8889678	Identification of urinary benzodiazepines and their metabolites: comparison of automated HPLC and GC-MS after immunoassay screening of clinical specimens. An automated high-performance liquid chromatographic method, benzodiazepines by REMEDi HS, was used to analyze benzodiazepines and their metabolites after beta-glucuronidase hydrolysis of 1-mL urine specimens from the following: 924 clinic and hospital patients whose specimens had previously been found to be presumptively positive using either EMIT or Triage immunoassay methodologies and 128 individuals whose specimens had screened negative by EMIT d.a.u.TM. REMEDi analyses did not correlate with the immunoassay results in 136 of the positive and three of the negative urine specimens. Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) confirmatory analyses were performed on these discordant specimens using 3 mL beta-glucuronidase-hydrolyzed urine followed by extraction with chloroform-isopropanol (9:1) and derivatization with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide. Two benzodiazepines, flunitrazepam and clonazepam, and their 7-amino metabolites were analyzed without prior derivatization. The analyses established 87% concordance between REMEDi and GC-MS versus 13% concordance with immunoassay for the subset. GC-MS analysis of these 142 specimens demonstrated two reasons for the nonconcurrence between REMEDi and EMIT: EMIT had given either false-negative or false-positive results and EMIT had given a positive result even though the determined metabolites were below the 200-ng/mL cutoff for the immunoassay and the 80-ng/mL cutoff for REMEDi. A total of 23 specimens were found to contain only lorazepam by REMEDi and GC-MS, 15 of which had been screened by Triage. A reevaluation of these 23 specimens by EMIT d.a.u. demonstrated that 11 were positive. This finding was in contrast to previous reports that EMIT will not detect lorazepam glucuronide in urine. An unexpected finding was the REMEDi identification and subsequent GC-MS confirmation of 7-aminoflunitrazepam, a urinary metabolite of flunitrazepam that is not available in the United States and that represented illicit use by four patients. A distinct advantage of REMEDi proved to be its capability in identifying demoxepam, a major metabolite of chlordiazepoxide; GC-MS analysis could not detect this metabolite because of its thermal decomposition to nordiazepam. To further evaluate the specificity of REMEDi, we conducted GC-MS analyses in a random fashion on 55 additional nondiscordant urine specimens that were identified as either positive or negative, as well as 22 specimens identified as containing 7-aminoclonazepam by REMEDi. Concurrence was observed between the two methods for all specimens, with the exception of one apparent false positive for alpha-hydroxyalprazolam by REMEDi. The reproducibility of the REMEDi method was found to be excellent; it was assessed by comparing results of 266 specimens that were reprocessed in different batches and for known calibrators and controls also processed with each batch. Study results demonstrated that the automated REMEDi assay for urinary benzodiazepines and their metabolites was comparable with GC-MS but had distinct advantages over GC-MS because of the following reasons: simplicity of the assay, less time required for analyses, and provision of additional information concerning the parent benzodiazepine.
16272403	Interspecies differences in pharmacokinetics and metabolism of S-3-(4-acetylamino-phenoxy)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-N-(4-nitro-3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-propionamide: the role of N-acetyltransferase. N-Acetyltransferase (NAT) is one of the major phase II enzymes involved in drug metabolism. Both species differences and polymorphism are observed in NAT expression. During the preclinical development of a novel selective androgen receptor modulator, S-3-(4-acetylamino-phenoxy)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-N-(4-nitro-3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-propionamide (S4), we also observed species differences in S4 metabolism due to the interaction between the deacetylation metabolite M1 and NAT, which converted M1 back to S4 both in vitro and in vivo. During incubation with human liver cytosol or rat liver S9 fraction in the presence of acetyl-CoA, more than 50% of M1 (2 microM) was converted back to S4, but this conversion was not observed in the incubation with dog liver S9 fraction or human liver microsome. In vivo pharmacokinetic experiments showed that M1 could be rapidly converted back to S4 in rats, but a similar conversion was not observed in dogs. When S4 was administered, the formation of M1 was only observed in dogs due to the absence of NAT expression. Simultaneous fitting of the concentration-time profiles of both S4 and M1 showed that more than 50% of S4 was deacetylated to M1 in dogs after i.v. administration of S4, whereas more than 80% of M1 was converted to S4 in rats after i.v. administration of M1. Considering the polymorphism in NAT expression, the interaction between M1 and NAT may raise concerns for drug-drug interactions during clinical applications of S4. The observed species differences suggested that interspecies scaling might not be applicable for predicting the metabolism and disposition of S4 in humans.
14578322	Sensitive HPLC-fluorescence method for irinotecan and four major metabolites in human plasma and saliva: application to pharmacokinetic studies. We developed gradient HPLC methods for quantification of the antimitotic drug irinotecan (CPT-11) and its four metabolites, SN-38, SN-38 G, 7-ethyl-10-[4-N-(5-aminopentanoic acid)-1-piperidino]-carbonyloxycamptothecin (APC), and 7-ethyl-10-[4amino-1-piperidino]-carbonyloxycamptothecin (NPC), as the sum of the lactone and carboxylate forms, in human plasma and saliva. Camptothecin was used as internal standard. The sample pretreatment involved protein precipitation with methanol-acetonitrile (50:50 by volume) followed by acidification with hydrochloric acid to convert the lactone ring-opened form into its lactone form, quantitatively. HPLC separation was performed on a Xterra RP18 column. The excitation wavelength was 370 nm, and the emission wavelength was set at 470 nm for the first 24 min and then at 534 nm for the next 4 min. The stabilities of irinotecan and its four metabolites in plasma, saliva, and acidic extracts were also investigated under various conditions. Assays were linear in the tested range of 0.5-1000 micro g/L. For the five analytes, limits of quantification were 0.5 micro g/L in both matrices. The interassay imprecision (as relative standard deviation) was 3.2-14% in plasma and 2.6-5.6% in saliva. Assay recoveries ranged from 92.8% to 111.2% for plasma and 100.1% to 104.1% for saliva. Mean extraction recovery from plasma or saliva was 90%. The developed assay can be used to determine pharmacokinetic parameters for CPT-11, SN-38, SN-38 G, APC, and NPC in plasma and saliva from patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
16854634	Simultaneous determination of azelnidipine and two metabolites in human plasma using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A quantitative assay method by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS) for the simultaneous determination of azelnidipine and its two metabolites, M-1 (aromatized form) and M-2 (hydroxylated form), in human plasma was developed and validated. Plasma samples, each of 1.0mL, were extracted by a single step liquid-liquid extraction using a mixture of ethyl acetate and hexane (1:1, v/v), and analyzed by the LC/ESI-MS/MS method. Three analytes were separated by isocratic elution on a C(18) column, and ionized using a positive ion electrospray ionization source. The ion transitions were monitored in selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. The chromatographic run time was 11min per injection, with retention time of 3.6, 10.2 and 6.8min for azelnidipine, M-1 and M-2, respectively. The calibration curves for azelnidipine, M-1 and M-2 well fitted to equations by a weighted (1/X(2)) quadratic regression over the range of 0.5-40.0ng/mL (r(2)>0.9979). The intra- and inter-assay precisions (coefficient of variation: C.V.), calculated from quality control (QC) samples, were less than 8.7 and 8.4%, 3.8 and 4.7%, and 11.9 and 13.9%, respectively, for azelnidipine, M-1 and M-2. The accuracy was within +/-9% for azelnidipine, within +/-7% for M-1 and within +/-16% for M-2. The overall recoveries for azelnidipine, M-1 and M-2 were 68.8-78.6%, 54.3-62.9% and 80.4-89.7%, respectively. All analytes evaluated demonstrated acceptable short-term, long-term, auto-sampler and stock solution stabilities. Furthermore, the method developed was successfully applied to pharmacokinetic studies on azelnidipine, M-1 and M-2 after an oral dose of 16mg CALBLOCK tablets (2mgx8mg tablets) to healthy volunteers.
20516255	In vitro metabolism, permeability, and efflux of bazedoxifene in humans. Bazedoxifene (BZA) acetate, a novel estrogen receptor modulator being developed for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, undergoes extensive metabolism in women after oral administration. In this study, the in vitro metabolism of [(14)C]BZA was determined in human hepatocytes and hepatic and intestinal microsomes, and the UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isozymes involved in the glucuronidation of BZA were identified. In addition, BZA was evaluated for its potential as a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter in Caco-2 cell monolayers. BZA was metabolized to two monoglucuronides, BZA-4'-glucuronide and BZA-5-glucuronide, in hepatocytes and in liver and intestinal microsomes including jejunum, duodenum, and ileum. Both BZA-4'-glucuronide and BZA-5-glucuronide were major metabolites in the intestinal microsomes, whereas BZA-4'-glucuronide was the predominant metabolite in liver microsomes and hepatocytes. The kinetic parameters of BZA-4'-glucuronide formation were determined in liver, duodenum, and jejunum microsomes and with UGT1A1, 1A8, and 1A10, the most active UGT isoforms involved in the glucuronidation of BZA, whereas those of BZA-5-glucuronide were determined with all the enzyme systems except in liver microsomes and in UGT1A1 because the formation of the BZA-5-glucuronide was too low. K(m) values in liver, duodenum, and jejunum microsomes and UGT1A1, 1A8, and 1A10, were similar and ranged from 5.1 to 33.1 microM for BZA-4'-glucuronide formation and from 2.5 to 11.1 microM for BZA-5-glucuronide formation. V(max) values ranged from 0.8 to 2.9 nmol/(min . mg) protein for BZA-4'-glucuronide and from 0.1 to 1.2 nmol/(min . mg) protein for BZA-5-glucuronide. In Caco-2 cells, BZA appeared to be a P-gp substrate.
14967000	In vitro metabolism of 2-acetylbenzothiophene: relevance to zileuton hepatotoxicity. Zileuton, an inhibitor of 5-lipooxygenase, the initial enzyme in the leukotriene pathway, was marketed as a new treatment for asthma. This drug has been associated with liver toxicity, which has limited its clinical usefulness. We provide evidence here that the liver toxicity likely involves a sequence of biotransformations leading to 2-acetylbenzothiophene (2-ABT), which is subsequently metabolized to give a reactive intermediate(s). In vitro experiments with the human lymphoblast MCL5 cell line demonstrated that 2-ABT is cytotoxic in a P450-dependent manner. Human liver microsome (HLM) incubations with 2-ABT revealed the formation of two short-lived oxidized species, "M + 16" and "M + 32". Both of these metabolites formed adducts in the presence of GSH or NAC. Singly oxidized M + 16 adducts, from either GSH or NAC, appeared to be unstable in acidic medium and eliminated water readily to form a new compound. Authentic synthetic standards demonstrated that 2-ABT-S-oxide M1 corresponded to the M + 16 metabolite and that the S-oxide underwent nucleophilic addition with GSH and NAC to produce the singly oxidized adducts observed in HLM. The S-oxide adducts readily eliminated water to form a rearomatized 2-ABT-GSH adduct or 2-ABT-NAC adduct. Coelution experiments with the synthetic standard confirmed the structure of the eliminated 2-ABT-NAC adduct C1. LC/MS analyses of urine samples collected from rats dosed with zileuton indicate that C1 is a metabolite of zileuton formed in vivo. The in vitro and in vivo data presented here demonstrate the formation of 2-ABT from zileuton and its further bioactivation to a potentially toxic metabolite.
16280454	Structural elucidation of human oxidative metabolites of muraglitazar: use of microbial bioreactors in the biosynthesis of metabolite standards. Muraglitazar (Pargluva), a dual alpha/gamma peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor activator, is currently in clinical development for treatment of type 2 diabetes. This study describes the structural elucidation of the human oxidative metabolites of muraglitazar through the use of a combination of microbial bioreactors, NMR and accurate mass analyses, and organic synthesis. Plasma, urine, and feces were collected from six healthy subjects following oral administration of 14C-labeled muraglitazar (10 mg, 100 microCi) and pooled samples were analyzed. Approximately 96% of the recovered radioactive dose was found in the feces and 3.5% in the urine. The parent compound represented >85% of the radioactivity in plasma. The fecal radioactivity was distributed among 16 metabolites (M1-M12, M14-M16, and M8a) and the parent drug, of which hydroxylation and O-demethylation metabolites (M5, M10, M11, M14, and M15) represented the prominent human metabolites. The urinary radioactivity was distributed into several peaks including muraglitazar glucuronide (M13) and the parent drug. Low concentrations of metabolites in human samples prevented direct identification of metabolites beyond liquid chromatographic (LC)-mass spectrometric analysis. Microbial strains Cunninghamella elegans and Saccharopolyspora hirsuta produced muraglitazar metabolites that had the same high performance liquid chromatography retention times and the same tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) properties as the corresponding human metabolites. The microbial metabolites M9, M10, M11, M14, M15, and M16 were isolated and analyzed by NMR. Based on these LC-MS/MS and NMR analyses, and organic synthesis, the structures of 16 human oxidative metabolites were identified. The oxidative metabolism of muraglitazar was characterized by hydroxylation, O-demethylation, oxazolering opening, and O-demethylation/hydroxylation, as well as O-dealkylation and carboxylic acid formation. This study demonstrated the utility of microbial bioreactors for the identification of metabolites.
22525521	Examination of the carboxylesterase phenotype in human liver. Carboxylesterases (CES) metabolize esters. Two CES isoforms are expressed in human liver (CES1 and CES2) and liver extracts are used in reaction phenotyping studies to discern interindividual metabolic variation. We tested the hypothesis that an individual's CES phenotype can be characterized by reporter substrates/probes that interrogate native CES1 and CES2 activities in liver and immunoblotting methods. We obtained 25 livers and found that CES1 is the main hydrolytic enzyme. Moreover, although CES1 protein levels were similar, we observed large interindividual variation in bioresmethrin hydrolysis rates (17-fold), a pyrethroid metabolized by CES1 but not CES2. Bioresmethrin hydrolysis rates did not correlate with CES1 protein levels. In contrast, procaine hydrolysis rates, a drug metabolized by CES2 but not CES1, were much less variant (3-fold). Using activity-based fluorophosphonate probes (FP-biotin), which covalently reacts with active serine hydrolases, CES1 protein was the most active enzyme in the livers. Finally, using bioorthogonal probes and click chemistry methodology, the half-life of CES 1 and 2 in cultured HepG2 cells was estimated at 96 h. The cause of the differential CES1 activities is unknown, but the underlying factors will be important to understand because several carboxylic acid ester drugs and environmental toxicants are metabolized by this enzyme.
18694908	Pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and excretion of torcetrapib, a cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor, in humans. The pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and excretion of torcetrapib, a selective inhibitor of human cholesteryl ester transfer protein, were investigated in healthy human male volunteers after oral administration of [(14)C]torcetrapib (120-mg dose). The total mean recovery of radiolabeled dose after 21 days was 75.7%, and most of the dose (63%) was excreted in the urine. The total circulating radioactivity and unchanged torcetrapib plasma concentrations increased over the first 6 h and then declined slowly with mean terminal elimination half-lives of 373 and 211 h. Metabolism of torcetrapib was extensive in humans. Only 5.2% of the total dose constituted unchanged torcetrapib in the feces, whereas no parent was excreted unchanged in the urine. Similarly, pharmacokinetic analysis of total radioactivity and unchanged torcetrapib revealed that the area under the concentration versus time curve from zero to infinity of torcetrapib accounted for approximately 7.0% of the circulating radioactivity. Torcetrapib was metabolized to numerous metabolites via oxidation. The primary metabolic pathway involved initial oxidative decarbamoylation followed by extensive further oxidation, resulting in the formation of bistrifluoromethylbenzoic acid (M1) and quinaldic acid (M4) metabolites. A mean 40% of the total dose was excreted in the urine as M4 (and its glucuronide and urea conjugates), whereas 7.0% of the total dose was excreted as M1. In vitro studies using human subcellular fractions suggested that the initial metabolism of torcetrapib proceeds via CYP3A-mediated decarbamoylation. Subsequent oxidations lead to the major circulating and excretory metabolites M1 and M4.
21194606	A bioequivalence comparison of two formulations of rifampicin (300- vs 150-mg capsules): An open-label, randomized, two-treatment, two-way crossover study in healthy volunteers. Rifampicin is a semisynthetic antibiotic derivative of rifamycin used worldwide for the treatment of various forms of tuberculosis. The objective of this study was to compare, under fasting conditions in healthy volunteers, the rate and extent of absorption of a generic rifampicin capsule in oral dosage form versus the proprietary equivalent formulation for the purpose of registration approval of the test formulation. This was an open-label, randomized, 2-treatment, 2-way crossover study with an 8-week washout period between the 2 study arms. Healthy volunteers received a 300-mg capsule of the test formulation (Idaman Pharma Manufacturing Sdn. Bhd.) or two 150-mg capsules of the reference formulation. Blood samples were collected predose and at 45 minutes and 1.25, 1.5, 2, 2.25, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours postdose. Plasma concentrations of rifampicin and its metabolite, 25-desacetyl rifampicin, were analyzed using a validated HPLC method. The formulations were considered bioequivalent if the 90% CIs for C(max) and AUC were within the predetermined bioequivalence range (80%-125%, according to the guidelines of the US Food and Drug Administration, or 75%-133% for Cmax only, as set by the European Commission-European Medicines Agency and the National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau of Malaysia). Tolerability was assessed by verbally questioning subjects regarding their well-being and any feelings of discomfort. All events reported by the subjects (serious or mild) were recorded on adverse-event forms. Fourteen healthy subjects (10 males, 4 females) with a mean age of 22.6 years (range, 20-28 years) and a mean body mass index of 22.2 kg/m² (range, 18.3-29.9 kg/m²) were enrolled in the study; all 14 completed the trial as outlined in the protocol. The mean values for C(max), T(max) , AUC₀₋₂₄, and AUC₀₋(∞)) with the test formulation of rifampicin were 7.20 μg/mL, 1.32 hours, 37.12 μg/mL · h, and 39.69 μg/mL · h, respectively; for the reference formulation, the values were 7.65 μg/mL, 1.71 hours, 38.92 μg/mL · h, and 42.24 μg/ mL · h. For 25-desacetyl rifampicin, the mean values for C(max), T(max), AUC₀₋₂₄, and AUC₀₋(∞)) with the test formulation were 0.63 μg/mL, 3.45 hours, 4.92 μg/mL · h, and 6.27 μg/mL · h; for the reference formulation, the values were 0.7 μg/mL, 3.27 hours, 5.23 μg/mL · h, and 6.84 μg/mL · h. For rifampicin, the 90% CIs for the test formulation/reference formulation ratio for the logarithmic transformations of both C(max) and AUC₀₋(∞)) were within the bioequivalence limit of 80% to 125% (80.9109.7 and 80.7-103.2, respectively). For 25-desacetyl rifampicin, the 90% CI for the test formulation/reference formulation ratio for the logarithmic transformations of AUC₀₋₂₄ (80.0-104.7) was within the bioequivalence limit of 80% to 125%. However, the 90% CI for C(max) (78.4-102.2) was outside this limit but still within the acceptance limit for Cmax when adhering to the bioequivalence range of 75% to 133%. No adverse events were reported during the study. This study found that the 300-mg test capsule and the 150-mg reference capsules of rifampicin met the regulatory criteria for assuming bioequivalence in these fasting healthy volunteers. Both formulations appeared to be well tolerated in the population studied.
17637185	Ester prodrugs of morphine improve transdermal drug delivery: a mechanistic study. Two alkyl esters of morphine, morphine propionate (MPR) and morphine enanthate (MEN), were synthesized as potential prodrugs for transdermal delivery. The ester prodrugs could enhance transdermal morphine delivery. The mechanisms of this enhancing effect were elucidated in this study. Both prodrugs were more lipophilic than their parent drug as evaluated by the skin/vehicle partition coefficient (log P) and capacity factor (log K'). The in-vitro skin permeation of morphine and its prodrugs from pH 6 buffer was in the order of MEN > MPR > morphine. MPR and MEN respectively enhanced the transdermal delivery of morphine by 2- and 5-fold. A contrary result was observed when using sesame oil as the vehicle. The prodrugs were stable against chemical hydrolysis in an aqueous solution, but were readily hydrolysed to the parent drug when exposed to skin homogenate and esterase. Approximately 98% MPR and approximately 75% MEN were converted to morphine in an in-vitro permeation experiment. The viable epidermis/dermis contributed to a significant resistance to the permeation of ester prodrugs. According to the data of skin permeation across ethanol-, alpha-terpineol-, and oleic acid-pretreated skin, MEN was predominantly transported via lipid bilayer lamellae in the stratum corneum. The intercellular pathway was not important for either morphine or MPR permeation.
22103858	Cytochromes P450 catalyze both steps of the major pathway of clopidogrel bioactivation, whereas paraoxonase catalyzes the formation of a minor thiol metabolite isomer. The mechanism generally admitted for the bioactivation of the antithrombotic prodrug, clopidogrel, is its two-step enzymatic conversion into a biologically active thiol metabolite. The first step is a classical cytochrome P450 (P450)-dependent monooxygenation of its thiophene ring leading to 2-oxo-clopidogrel, a thiolactone metabolite. The second step was described as a P450-dependent oxidative opening of the thiolactone ring of 2-oxo-clopidogrel, with intermediate formation of a reactive sulfenic acid metabolite that is eventually reduced to the corresponding thiol 4b. A very recent paper published in Nat. Med. (Bouman et al., (2011) 17, 110) reported that the second step of clopidogrel bioactivation was not catalyzed by P450 enzymes but by paraoxonase-1(PON-1) and that PON-1 was a major determinant of clopidogrel efficacy. The results described in the present article show that there are two metabolic pathways for the opening of the thiolactone ring of 2-oxo-clopidogrel. The major one, that was previously described, results from a P450-dependent redox bioactivation of 2-oxo-clopidogrel and leads to 4b cis, two previously reported thiol diastereomers bearing an exocyclic double bond. The second, minor one, results from a hydrolysis of 2-oxo-clopidogrel, which seems to be dependent on PON-1, and leads to an isomer of 4b cis, 4b "endo", in which the double bond has migrated from an exocyclic to an endocyclic position in the piperidine ring. These results were obtained from a detailed study of the metabolism of 2-oxo-clopidogrel by human liver microsomes and human sera and analysis by HPLC-MS under conditions allowing a complete separation of the thiol metabolite isomers, either as such or after derivatization with 3'-methoxy phenacyl bromide or N-ethyl maleimide (NEM). These results also show that the major bioactive thiol isomer found in the plasma of clopidogrel-treated patients derives from 2-oxo-clopidogrel by the P450-dependent pathway. Finally, chemical experiments on 2-oxo-clopidogrel showed that this thiolactone is in equilibrium with its tautomer having a double bond inside the piperidine ring and that nucleophiles such as CH(3)O(-) preferentially react on the thioester function of this tautomer. This allowed us to understand why 4b cis has to be formed via an oxidative opening of 2-oxo-clopidogrel thiolactone, whereas a hydrolytic opening of this thiolactone ring leads to the "endo" thiol isomer 4b "endo".
17529889	A novel enantioselective microassay for the high-performance liquid chromatography determination of oxcarbazepine and its active metabolite monohydroxycarbazepine in human plasma. A simple and innovative assay is described that allows the determination of the antiepileptic drug oxcarbazepine and the chiral separation of the two enantiomers of its active metabolite monohydroxycarbazepine (licarbazepine). The assay requires liquid-liquid extraction of the sample (200 microL) into tert-butyl methyl ether and dichloromethane, drying of the organic phase under a nitrogen stream, reconstitution with the mobile phase, and injection in the high-performance liquid chromatography system after filtering. Separation of oxcarbazepine, R-(-)-monohydroxycarbazepine, S-(+)-monohydroxycarbazepine, and the second-step metabolite 10,11-trans-dihydroxycarbamazepine (racemate) is achieved with a Chiralcel ODR column and potassium hexafluorophosphate/acetonitrile as mobile phase. Detection is by ultraviolet absorbance at 210 nm. Standard curves are linear (r2 > or = 0.999) over the range of 0.1 to 25 microg/mL for each analyte with a limit of quantification of 0.1 microg/mL (1 ng injected) for all compounds. Within-day and between-day precision is better than 12% and within-day and between-day accuracy is between 99% and 116% for each compound. These performance characteristics are adequate for pharmacokinetic studies and for therapeutic drug monitoring. However, because the two enantiomers of monohydroxycarbazepine exhibit similar pharmacologic activity, nonenantioselective assays are likely to be more cost-effective for therapeutic drug monitoring purposes.
20005184	Simultaneous determination of ABT-888, a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor, and its metabolite in human plasma by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. A reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for simultaneous determination of ABT-888 and its major metabolite (M8) in human plasma. Sample preparation involved a liquid-liquid extraction by the addition of 0.25 ml of plasma with 10 microl of 1 M NaOH and 1.0 ml ethyl acetate containing 50 ng/ml of the internal standard zileuton. The analytes were separated on a Waters XBridge C(18) column using a gradient mobile phase consisting of methanol/water containing 0.45% formic acid at the flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The analytes were monitored by tandem mass spectrometry with electrospray positive ionization. Linear calibration curves were generated over the ABT-888 and M8 concentration ranges of 1-2000 ng/ml in human plasma. The lower limits of quantitation (LLOQ) were 1 ng/ml for both ABT-888 and M8 in human plasma. The accuracy and within- and between-day precisions were within the generally accepted criteria for bioanalytical method (<15%). This method was successfully employed to characterize the plasma concentration-time profile of ABT-888 after its oral administration in cancer patients.
17624024	Nafamostat is hydrolysed by human liver cytosolic long-chain acyl-CoA hydrolase. Although the authors recently reported that nafamostat, a clinically used serine protease inhibitor, was mainly hydrolysed by carboxylesterase in human liver microsomes, the involvement of human liver cytosol has not been elucidated. The current study examined the in vitro metabolism of nafamostat with human liver cytosols. Kinetic analysis indicated that the Vmax and Km values in the liver cytosols were 9.82 nmolmin(-1) mg(-1) protein and 197 microM for a liver sample HL-1, and 15.1 nmolmin(-1) mg(-1) protein and 157 microM for HL-2, respectively. The Vmax/Km values in both cytosols were at least threefold higher than those in the corresponding microsomes. The liver cytosolic activity for nafamostat hydrolysis was inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (43% inhibition at 100 microM), whereas diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) and bis(p-nitrophenyl)phosphate (BNPP) failed to inhibit the activity. Furthermore, the hydrolytic activity was also reduced by palmitoyl-CoA (67% inhibition at 100 microM) but not by acetyl-CoA. Effects of PMSF, DFP and BNPP on cytosolic palmitoyl-CoA hydrolytic activity were comparable with those of the cytosolic nafamostat hydrolytic activity. In addition, the palmitoyl-CoA hydrolytic activity was competitively inhibited by nafamostat with the apparent Ki value of 164 microM for the liver cytosol from HL-2. These results suggest that an isoform of long-chain acyl-CoA hydrolase may be responsible for the nafamostat hydrolysis in human liver cytosol.
22648910	In vitro and in vivo evaluation of a sulfenamide prodrug of basic metformin. In the present study, a previously described sulfenamide prodrug of a basic antidiabetic drug, metformin, was evaluated further. This sulfenamide prodrug was designed to improve the permeability and consequently the oral absorption and bioavailability (F) of the highly water-soluble metformin. Bioactivation of the prodrug was mediated by reduced glutathione, but it has been reported that sulfenamide prodrugs can also be bioactivated by other endogenous thiols like cysteine, and free thiol-containing proteins. Consistent with earlier findings for a sulfenamide prodrug of a weakly acid drug, linezolid, the permeability studies indicated that the metformin prodrug was also prematurely bioactivated on the apical surface of the Caco-2 cell monolayer. Nevertheless, the bioavailability of metformin was increased by approximately 25% after oral administration of the prodrug in rats, most probably because of better oral absorption. This indicates that the sulfenamide prodrug approach may be used to improve the moderate oral bioavailability of metformin, which may help to decrease the uncomfortable gastrointestinal adverse effects associated with metformin therapy as the daily doses of metformin can be reduced. Furthermore, the present study confirms that the applicability of the sulfenamide prodrug approach can be successfully extended from weak NH acids to very basic guanide-type drugs.
1989637	Determination of thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide (TAD) levels in mononuclear cells of leukemic patients treated with tiazofurin. Tiazofurin is an oncolytic agent which has shown therapeutic activity in end-stage acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) and blast crisis of chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL-BC). Tiazofurin is anabolized to the active metabolite, thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide (TAD), which inhibits IMP dehydrogenase activity, leading to reduction of guanylate pools and cessation of cancer cell proliferation. The concentration of TAD in neoplastic cells of patients treated with tiazofurin should be a good indicator of sensitivity to the drug and also might herald the emergence of drug-resistant cells. Therefore, the precise quantitation of TAD in cancer cells during tiazofurin treatment is essential. In this paper we report a highly sensitive method for the determination of TAD in biological samples. With this technique, in addition to TAD, thirteen other biologically relevant adenine, guanine, cytosine and uridine nucleotides can be separated and quantitated accurately. TAD standard was separated on a Waters Partisil 10-SAX column in a RCM-10 module using an ammonium phosphate buffer system. TAD eluted at 21 min with a limit of detection of 15 pmol and linearity up to 3 nmol. The coefficient of variation was 0.6 +/- 0.1% for retention time and 2 +/- 0.3% for TAD concentration. Recovery of TAD was 96% with reproducibility of 98%. To examine the applicability of this method to a clinical setting, blood samples were obtained from a patient with CGL-BC and leukocytes were separated on a Ficoll-Hypaq gradient, extracted with trichloroacetic acid, and an aliquot was analyzed on HPLC. The TAD peak was identified by comparing the retention time and spectral analysis of the standard. After the patient was treated with a 2200 mg/m2 (12.7 mM) dose of tiazofurin, the TAD concentrations in the mononuclear cells at 2, 6, and 24 hr were 23.1, 13.6, and 0.8 microM. TAD levels at 2, 6, and 24 hr after a tiazofurin dose of 3300 mg/m2 (21.1 mM) were 42.8, 26.1, and 1.4 microM respectively.
15450953	Anabolism of amdoxovir: phosphorylation of dioxolane guanosine and its 5'-phosphates by mammalian phosphotransferases. Amdoxovir [(-)-beta-D-2,6-diaminopurine dioxolane, DAPD], the prodrug of dioxolane guanosine (DXG), is currently in Phase I/II clinical development for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. In this study, we examined the phosphorylation pathway of DXG using 15 purified enzymes from human (8), animal (6), and yeast (1) sources, including deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK), deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), high Km 5'-nucleotidase (5'-NT), guanylate (GMP) kinase, nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) kinase, adenylate (AMP) kinase, nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinase, 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) kinase, creatine kinase, and pyruvate kinase. In addition, the metabolism of 14C-labeled DXG was studied in CEM cells. DXG was not phosphorylated by human dCK, and was a poor substrate for human dGK with a high Km (7 mM). Human 5'-NT phosphorylated DXG with relatively high efficiency (4.2% of deoxyguanosine). DXG-MP was a substrate for porcine brain GMP kinase with a substrate specificity that was 1% of dGMP. DXG-DP was phosphorylated by all of the enzymes tested, including NDP kinase, 3-PG kinase, creatine kinase, and pyruvate kinase. The BB-isoform of human creatine kinase showed the highest relative substrate specificity (47% of dGDP) for DXG-DP. In CEM cells incubated with 5 microM DXG for 24 h, 0.015 pmole/10(6) cells (approximately 7.5 nM) of DXG-TP was detected as the primary metabolite. Our study demonstrated that 5'-nucleotidase, GMP kinase, creatine kinase, and NDP kinase could be responsible for the activation of DXG in vivo.
16891251	Metabolism of the recently encountered designer drug, methylone, in humans and rats. The urinary metabolites of methylone in humans and rats were investigated by analysing urine specimens from its abuser and after administrating to rats with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI MS), using authentic standards. The time-course excretion profiles of methylone and its three metabolites in rats were further investigated after a single intraperitoneal dosing of 5 mg kg-1 methylone hydrochloride. Two major metabolic pathways were revealed for both humans and rats as follows: (1) side-chain degradation by N-demethylation to the corresponding primary amine methylenedioxycathinone (MDC), partly conjugated; and (2) demethylenation followed by O-methylation of either a 3- or 4-OH group on the benzene ring to produce 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethcathinone (HMMC) or 3-hydroxy-4-methoxymethcathinone (3-OH-4-MeO-MC), respectively, mostly conjugated. Of these metabolites, HMMC was the most abundant in humans and rats. The cumulative amount of urinary HMMC excreted within the first 48 h in rats was approximately 26% of the dose, and the amount of the parent methylone was not more than 3%. These results demonstrate that the analysis of HMMC will be indispensable for proof of the use of methylone in forensic urinalysis.
8293546	Sulfation of aromatic hydroxamic acids and hydroxylamines by multiple forms of human liver sulfotransferases. Sulfation activity towards various heterocyclic and homocyclic aromatic hydroxamic acids and hydroxylamines was determined in adult human liver cytosol and with partially purified human liver sulfotransferases (STs). In adult human liver cytosols comparable ST activities towards N-hydroxy-2-acetyl-amino-5-phenylpyridine (N-OH-2AAPP), N-hydroxy-4-acetylaminobiphenyl (N-OH-4AABP) and N-hydroxy-4'fluoro-4-acetylaminobiphenyl (N-OH-4FAABP) were found, while the sulfation rates towards N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene (N-OH-2AAF), N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminonaphthalene (N-OH-2AAN), N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminophenanthrene (N-OH-2AAP) and N-hydroxy-4-acetylaminostilbene (N-OH-4AAS) were two- to five-fold lower. In adult liver cytosol ST activity was found towards all hydroxylamines tested. No significant differences were found for the various hydroxylamines. In general, the ST activities towards the various hydroxamic acids and hydroxylamines were comparable to phenol ST activity using adult liver cytosols. Partial purification of adult human liver STs was achieved by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography followed by anion exchange FPLC. Two separated protein peaks showing both N-OH-2AAPP and N-OH-2APP ST activities were observed and were designated human hydroxylamine/hydroxamic acid sulfotransferase (hHST) 1 and 2. Immunoblot analysis using an anti-rat estrogen ST antibody demonstrated cross reactivity with both hHSTs at a subunit mol. wt of 32 kDa corresponding to the phenol-sulfating form of phenol ST (P-PST). ST activity towards dopamine was low with both hHSTs, but hHST1 also contained significant capacity to sulfate dehydroepiandrosterone. The highest ST activity towards N-OH-2AAPP and N-OH-2APP was measured at pH 5.5 with both hHSTs. The Km values of the two hHSTs for sulfation of N-OH-2AAPP and N-OH-2APP were comparable, while the Vmax values for sulfation of N-OH-2APP were higher than for N-OH-2AAP with both hHSTs. FPLC anion exchange analysis of human platelet STs demonstrated that sulfation of N-OH-4ABP and N-OH-4AABP was associated with P-PST rather than M-PST (platelets do not possess any significant DHEA ST activity). Our results show that the various hydroxamic acids and hydroxylamines are converted by at least two hHSTs. The results presented here for the human liver hydroxamic acid and hydroxylamine ST activities are discussed in relation to those observed in the rat.
22041109	Mass balance study of [¹⁴C]eribulin in patients with advanced solid tumors. This mass balance study investigated the metabolism and excretion of eribulin, a nontaxane microtubule dynamics inhibitor with a novel mechanism of action, in patients with advanced solid tumors. A single approximately 2 mg (approximately 80 μCi) dose of [¹⁴C]eribulin acetate was administered as a 2 to 5 min bolus injection to six patients on day 1. Blood, urine, and fecal samples were collected at specified time points on days 1 to 8 or until sample radioactivity was ≤1% of the administered dose. Mean plasma eribulin exposure (627 ng · h/ml) was comparable with that of total radioactivity (568 ng Eq · h/ml). Time-matched concentration ratios of eribulin to total radioactivity approached unity in blood and plasma, indicating that unchanged parent compound constituted almost all of the eribulin-derived radioactivity. Only minor metabolites were detected in plasma samples up to 60 min postdose, pooled across patients, each metabolite representing ≤0.6% of eribulin. Elimination half-lives for eribulin (45.6 h) and total radioactivity (42.3 h) were comparable. Eribulin-derived radioactivity excreted in feces was 81.5%, and that of unchanged eribulin was 61.9%. Renal clearance (0.301 l/h) was a minor component of total eribulin clearance (3.93 l/h). Eribulin-derived radioactivity excreted in urine (8.9%) was comparable with that of unchanged eribulin (8.1%), indicating minimal excretion of metabolite(s) in urine. Total recovery of the radioactive dose was 90.4% in urine and feces. Overall, no major metabolites of eribulin were detected in plasma. Eribulin is eliminated primarily unchanged in feces, whereas urine constitutes a minor route of elimination.
3956564	Phenprocoumon metabolites in human plasma; characterization by HPLC and GC-MS. Pooled plasma from patients receiving phenprocoumon anticoagulant therapy was extracted and the following substances were characterized: phenprocoumon, and its 7-hydroxy,4'-hydroxy and 6-hydroxy derivatives; they were identified by HPLC and after methylation by quartz capillary GC-MS using the electron impact and selective ion monitoring modes. This is the first occasion when phenprocoumon metabolites have been identified in plasma; they were unconjugated and in much lower concentrations (43.2 and 2 ng/ml for the 7,4' and 6-hydroxy derivatives, respectively) than the original compound (2000 ng/ml).
7788866	Non-specific inhibition of cytochrome P450 activities by chlorophyllin in human and rat liver microsomes. Chlorophyllin, a copper/sodium salt of chlorophyll used in the treatment of geriatric patients, inhibits the mutagenicity of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 3-amino-1-methyl-5H- pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2), aflatoxin B1 and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P). Recent in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that a molecular complex is formed between IQ and chlorophyllin, suggesting that this complex formation might be responsible for the antigenotoxic effect of chlorophyllin observed. Cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes appear to be the major catalysts in the bioactivation of these carcinogens. We have investigated the in vitro effects of chlorophyllin on several P450 activities including ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation, benzyloxyresorufin O-debenzylation, coumarin 7-hydroxylation, 7-ethoxycourmarin O-deethylation, B[a]P 3-hydroxylation, and chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylation. Chlorophyllin non-specifically inhibited all of P450 activities observed. Spectrally detectable P450 was also destroyed in microsomes and purified P450 in a reconstituted system in the presence of chlorophyllin and an NADPH-generating system. These results suggest that the antigenotoxic effect of chlorophyllin might be due to inhibition of P450 enzymes involving bioactivation of carcinogens in addition to molecular complex formation between carcinogens and chlorophyllin. Comparison of the apparent Ki for P450 inactivation with previously estimated constants for chlorophyllin-IQ complexation suggest that P450 inhibition should be the dominant mechanism of inhibition.
15770075	Influence of itraconazole co-administration and CYP2D6 genotype on the pharmacokinetics of the new antipsychotic ARIPIPRAZOLE. The results of in vitro studies indicated that ARIPIPRAZOLE, a newly developed antipsychotic, is mainly metabolized by the human cytochrome P450 isozymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. The objective of the present study was to investigate the influence of itraconazole (hereafter referred to as ITZ) co-administration (CYP3A4 inhibition) on the pharmacokinetics of ARIPIPRAZOLE administered to 24 healthy adult male volunteers in a fasting condition. The influence of CYP3A4 inhibition was also examined by CYP2D6 genotype. All subjects were administered a single oral dose of ARIPIPRAZOLE alone in Period I and a single oral dose of ARIPIPRAZOLE following administration of ITZ at 100 mg/day for 7 consecutive days in Period II. The pharmacokinetic parameters of ARIPIPRAZOLE and its main metabolite OPC-14857 were determined. Co-administration of ITZ increased the Cmax, AUC336 hr, and t1/2,z of ARIPIPRAZOLE and OPC-14857 by 19.4%, 48.0%, and 18.6% and by 18.6%, 38.8%, and 53.4%, respectively. By co-administration of ITZ, the CL/F of ARIPIPRAZOLE in extensive metabolizers was decreased by 26.6%, with an even greater decrease (47.3%) in intermediate metabolizers. For the co-administration period, the CL/F of ARIPIPRAZOLE in intermediate metabolizers was about half of that in extensive metabolizers. For Cmax, there was no significant difference between extensive metabolizers and intermediate metabolizers, and the percent change by co-administration of ITZ was less than 20% in both extensive metabolizers and intermediate metabolizers. For OPC-14857, the t(max) in intermediate metabolizers was longer than that in extensive metabolizers, with the difference being amplified by co-administration of ITZ. The AUC336 hr showed similar increases by co-administration of ITZ in all genotypes. The urinary 6beta-hydroxycortisol/cortisol concentration ratio following ITZ administration for 7 consecutive days was about half of that before the start of ITZ administration, indicating that CYP3A4 metabolic activity was inhibited by administration of ITZ. The influence of CYP3A4 inhibition on the pharmacokinetics of ARIPIPRAZOLE was not considered to be clinically significant. On the other hand, definite differences in pharmacokinetics were observed between CYP2D6 genotypes.
24900270	Synthesis and Evaluation of the Metabolites of AMG 221, a Clinical Candidate for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes. All eight of the major active metabolites of (S)-2-((1S,2S,4R)-bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-ylamino)-5-isopropyl-5-methylthiazol-4(5H)-one (AMG 221, compound 1), an inhibitor of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 that has entered the clinic for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, were synthetically prepared and confirmed by comparison with samples generated in liver microsomes. After further profiling, we determined that metabolite 2 was equipotent to 1 on human 11β-HSD1 and had lower in vivo clearance and higher bioavailability in rat and mouse. Compound 2 was advanced into a pharmacodynamic model in mouse where it inhibited adipose 11β-HSD1 activity.
12944173	Development, validation and characterization of an analytical method for the quantification of hydrolysable urinary metabolites and plasma protein adducts of 2,4- and 2,6-toluene diisocyanate, 1,5-naphthalene diisocyanate and 4,4'-methylenediphenyl diisocyanate. Occupational exposure to diisocyanates within the plastic industry causes irritation and disorders in the airway. The aim of this study was to develop, validate and characterize a method for the determination of 2,4-toluenediamine (2,4-TDA), 2,6-toluenediamine (2,6-TDA), 1,5-diaminonaphthalene (1,5-NDA) and 4,4'-methylenedianiline (4,4'-MDA) in hydrolysed urine and plasma, and to study the correlation between the plasma and urinary levels of these potential biomarkers of 2,4-toluene diisocyanate (2,4-TDI), 2,6-toluene diisocyanate (2,6-TDI), 1,5-naphthalene diisocyanate (1,5-NDI) and 4,4'-methylenediphenyl diisocyanate (4,4'-MDI), respectively. Samples were hydrolysed with 0.3 M NaOH at 100 degrees C for 24 h. The diamines were extracted, derivatized with pentafluoropropionic acid anhydride, and quantified by selected ion monitoring on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The repeatability and reproducibility of the method were 7-18% and 7-19%, respectively. Dialysis experiments showed that the metabolites of 2,4-TDI, 2,6-TDI, 1,5-NDI and 4,4'-MDI in plasma were exclusively protein adducts. No free diamines were found in urine, indicating that all diisocyanate-related metabolites were in a conjugated form. For each diisocyanate-related biomarker, there were strongly significant correlations (p<0.001) between individual levels of metabolites in plasma and urine, with Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (rs) values of 0.74-0.90. The methods presented here will be valuable for the development of biological monitoring methods for diisocyanates.
17389558	Age and gender effects on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ramelteon, a hypnotic agent acting via melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2. Effects of age and gender on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ramelteon, a hypnotic acting via binding to melatonin MT(1) and MT(2) receptors, were evaluated in healthy young (18-34 years) and elderly (63-79 years) volunteers. Part 1 evaluated the pharmacokinetics of open-label oral ramelteon, 16 mg. Part 2 was a double-blind, randomized, 2-trial crossover pharmacodynamic study of 16-mg ramelteon and matching placebo. Ramelteon clearance was significantly reduced in elderly vs young volunteers (384 vs 883 mL/min/kg, P<.01) and half-life significantly increased (1.9 vs 1.3 h, P<.001). Gender did not significantly influence clearance or half-life. Ramelteon was extensively transformed to its hydroxylated M-II metabolite, with serum AUC values averaging about 30 times those of the parent drug. Compared to placebo, ramelteon increased self- and observer-rated sedation, but age and gender did not influence the magnitude of the ramelteon-placebo difference. Ramelteon did not significantly impair digit-symbol substitution test performance or impair information acquisition and recall. Thus, the reduced clearance and higher serum levels of ramelteon in elderly subjects were not associated with enhanced pharmacodynamic effects. The usually recommended clinical dose of ramelteon (8 mg) does not require modification based on age or gender.
12142643	Relationship between plasma concentrations of trazodone and its active metabolite, m-chlorophenylpiperazine, and its clinical effect in depressed patients. Relationships between plasma concentrations of trazodone and m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP) and the clinical effects were studied in 26 patients (12 males and 14 females) with major depression during three weeks' treatment of 150 mg/d trazodone using an open-study design. Depressive symptoms were evaluated by Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and subjective side effects were assessed by UKU side effects rating scale (UKU) before treatment and at weekly intervals. Plasma concentrations of trazodone and m-CPP were measured by HPLC. There were significant linear relationships between the steady-state plasma concentration (Css) of trazodone and both the final MADRS score (rs = -0.529, P < 0.01) and the percent improvement at 3 weeks (r = 0.442, P < 0.05). Moreover, the proportion of responders (a final MADRS score of 10 or less) was significantly higher in the group with a trazodone concentration greater than 714 ng/mL (6/8 vs 3/18, P = 0.008). No significant correlation was found between UKU score and the Css for either compound nor between the UKU score and the ratio of m-CPP/trazodone. The current study suggests that a therapeutic response is dependent on the plasma concentration of trazodone but not m-CPP and that a plasma trazodone concentration of about 700 ng/mL may be a threshold for a good therapeutic response.
21819790	Determination of tapentadol and its metabolite N-desmethyltapentadol in urine and oral fluid using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectral detection. An analytical procedure for the determination of the new pain medication tapentadol and its main metabolite N-desmethyltapentadol (DMT), in urine and oral fluid has been developed and validated using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectral detection (LC-MS-MS). Oral fluid was collected using Quantisal™ devices, and drugs present were quantified using solid-phase extraction followed by LC-MS-MS. For confirmation, two transitions were monitored and one ratio determined which had to be within 20% of that of the known calibration standard. For tapentadol, 222.1 > 107 was used as the quantifying transition; 222.1 > 121 for the qualifier. For DMT, 208.1 > 107 was used for quantification; 208.1 > 121 as the qualifier. For saliva, the linear range was 10-100 ng/mL; the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) was 10 ng/mL; the intraday precision was 3.6% (n = 6) and interday precision was 13.6% (n = 24). The recovery of tapentadol and DMT from the oral fluid collection pad was > 99%. For urine, the specimens were diluted and injected directly into the LC-MS-MS. The LLOQ was 50 ng/mL; the intraday and interday precisions were 2.1% and 4.4%, respectively, for tapentadol and 2.9% and 5.7%, respectively, for DMT. This is the first analytical procedure for tapentadol and DMT in urine and oral fluid.
19353999	Variable inhibitory effect of different brands of commercial herbal supplements on human cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4. The use of herbal supplements has increased dramatically, making drug interactions with these supplements a major concern. Because herbal supplements are not subject to the same regulations as prescription drugs, we hypothesize that the content of their active ingredients may vary among manufacturers, potentially causing a large variation in therapeutic outcome. The present study aimed to test this hypothesis on commonly used herbal products, i.e. black cohosh (BC), grape seed extract (GSE), green tea extract (GTE) and ginseng. Activity of human CYP3A4 enzyme was used as a parameter to determine the effect of these selected herbal supplements from various manufacturers. The contents of an herbal product, equivalent to one capsule, was extracted with methanol. Aliquots of the extract were tested for their ability to inhibit the metabolism of the human CYP3A4 probe quinine, using an in vitro liver microsomal technique. Human liver microsomes and quinine were incubated at 37 degrees C with or without (i.e. control) herbal extract. Formation of quinine's metabolite 3-hydroxyquinine, generated by the CYP3A4-mediated reaction, was measured by HPLC. Seven products of BC were tested, and inhibition of CYP3A4 was not observed. Four brands of GSE had no effect, while another five produced mild to moderate but variable inhibition of CYP3A4, ranging from 6.4% by Country Life GSE to 26.8% by Loma Linda Market brand. Among the supplements tested, GTE produced the most pronounced inhibition of CYP3A4, which ranged from 5.6% by Nature's Resource to 89.9% by Natrol GTE product. Nine ginseng products studied had little to no effect on the activity of CYP3A4. This study suggests that GTE use may cause significant interactions with drugs metabolized by CYP3A4. However, the effect on CYP3A4 varied among different brands of GTE, possibly due to variations in their content of the herbal product's active ingredients.
21673127	A novel biotransformation of alkyl aminopyrrolidine to aminopiperidine ring by human CYP3A. The novel biotransformation of an aminopyrrolidine to an aminopiperidine during the metabolism of 5-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-methyl-2-((2R)-2-(((1-methylethyl)amino)methyl)-1-pyrrolidinyl)-6-(4-pyridinyl)-4(3H)-pyrimidinone (AMG657417) was investigated using the NADPH-fortified S9 fraction from human liver. The major metabolite (M18) had a protonated molecule (MH(+) m/z 438) identical to that of AMG657417 except that it eluted earlier on a reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The structure of M18 had been identified as 5-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-methyl-2-((1-(1-methylethyl)-3-piperidinyl)amino)-6-(4-pyridinyl)-4(3H)-pyrimidinone (I) by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and proton NMR. M18 was not observed when AMG657417 was incubated with either microsomal or cytosolic fraction from human liver, suggesting the involvement of both microsomal and cytosolic enzymes in the biotransformation. The reaction mechanisms have been elucidated by trapping the intermediates formed during the biotransformation. An aldehyde intermediate was initially produced by hydroxylation and opening of the pyrrolidine ring of the parent molecule, followed by intramolecular Schiff-base formation between the exocyclic isopropylamine nitrogen and the aldehyde carbonyl to form a piperidinyl iminium ion. The iminium ion was then reduced to the piperidine product. The presence of the aldehyde intermediate was verified by the formation of semicarbazide conjugates in human liver microsomal, S9, and recombinant CYP3A4 incubations of AMG657417. The presence of the piperidinyl iminium ion intermediate was confirmed by the formation of cyanide conjugates in the incubations in human liver S9. Two cyanide conjugates with identical protonated molecule and product ion mass spectra were observed, indicating the likelihood of diastereomer formation. A chemical inhibition study in NADPH-fortified S9 fraction indicated that the oxidation of AMG657417 was catalyzed almost exclusively by CYP3A.
19405998	Specific aminopeptidases of excised human nasal epithelium and primary culture: a comparison of functional characteristics and gene transcripts expression. To investigate whether growing human nasal epithelium as primary cultures alters aminopeptidase B (APB), aminopeptidase N (APN) and dipeptidyldipeptidase (DPPIV) metabolic characteristics, and mRNA gene transcript expression. The formation of 7-amino-methyl coumarin from specific substrates for APN (L-alanine-4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide, APB (L-arginine-4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide) and DPPIV (glycyl-L-proline-4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide) was used to estimate the KM, Vmax and the effect of aminopeptidases inhibitors on the enzymes. Polymerase chain reaction was used to investigate gene expression. Results of this study showed that: (1) both the excised tissues and primary cultures of human nasal epithelium expressed APN, APB and DPPIV activity; (2) the KM of APB, APN and DPPIV was not significantly different in cell and tissue homogenates; (3) except for APN, the Vmax was not significantly different in the two metabolism models; (4) there was no statistically significant difference in the behaviours of APB, APN and DPPIV in response to inhibition by puromycin and bestatin in the two models; (5) the mRNA transcripts that encode APB, APN and DPPIV were expressed in both cell culture and tissue homogenate. Based on the results of this study, it may be concluded that nasal primary culture system is suitable for investigating peptide and protein metabolism and enzymatic stability in human nasal epithelium. Except for APN, the tissue culture conditions did not significantly alter the functional and molecular expression of the aminopeptidases.
18757786	Effect of single and repeated doses of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide. Effects of single and multiple doses of oral ketoconazole on roflumilast and its active metabolite, roflumilast N-oxide, were investigated in healthy subjects. In study 1, subjects (n = 26) received oral roflumilast 500 microg once daily for 11 days and a concomitant 200-mg single dose of ketoconazole on day 11. In study 2, subjects (n = 16) received oral roflumilast 500 microg on days 1 and 11 and a repeated dose of ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily from days 8 to 20. Coadministration of single-dose ketoconazole with steady-state roflumilast increased the AUC of roflumilast by 34%; C(max) was unchanged. For roflumilast N-oxide, AUC and C(max) decreased by 12% and 20%, respectively. Repeated doses of ketoconazole increased the AUC and C(max) of roflumilast by 99% and 23%, respectively; for roflumilast N-oxide, AUC was unchanged, and C(max) decreased by 38%. No clinically relevant adverse events were observed. Coadministration of ketoconazole and roflumilast does not require dose adjustment of roflumilast.
17890446	In vitro metabolism study of combretastatin A-4 in rat and human liver microsomes. The phase I biotransformation of combretastatin A-4 (CA-4) 1, a potent tubulin polymerization inhibitor with antivascular and antitumoral properties, was studied using rat and human liver subcellular fractions. The metabolites were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography and detected with simultaneous UV and electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry. The assignment of metabolite structures was based on ESI-tandem mass spectrometry experiments, and it was confirmed by comparison with reference samples obtained by synthesis. O-Demethylation and aromatic hydroxylation are the two major phase I biotransformation pathways, the latter being regioselective for phenyl ring B of 1. Indeed, incubation with rat and human microsomal fractions led to the formation of a number of metabolites, eight of which were identified. The regioselectivity of microsomal oxidation was also demonstrated by the lack of metabolites arising from stilbenic double bond epoxidation. Alongside the oxidative metabolism, Z-E isomerization during in vitro study was also observed, contributing to the complexity of the metabolite pattern. Moreover, when 1 was incubated with a cytosolic fraction, metabolites were not observed. Aromatic hydroxylation at the C-6' of phenyl ring B and isomerization led to the formation of M1 and M2 metabolites, which were further oxidized to the corresponding para-quinone (M7 and M8) species whose role in pharmacodynamic activity is unknown. Metabolites M4 and M5, arising from O-demethylation of phenyl ring B, did not form the ortho-quinones. O-Demethylation of phenyl ring A formed the metabolite M3 with a complete isomerization of the stilbenic double bond.
12163135	Effect of tibolone (Org OD14) and its metabolites on aromatase and estrone sulfatase activity in human breast adipose stromal cells and in MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cells. Tibolone (Org OD14) is a synthetic steroid used for post-menopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Since HRT might increase breast cancer risk, it is important to determine the possible effects of tibolone on breast tissues. Tibolone and its metabolites Org 4094, Org 30126 and Org OM38 have been reported to inhibit estrone sulfatase activity in MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cell lines, which suggest beneficial effects on hormone dependent breast cancer by reducing local production of free estrogens. Breast adipose stromal cells (ASCs) contain aromatase activity-an obligatory step in the biosynthesis of estrogens-and possibly contain sulfatase activity. We investigated the effects of tibolone, its metabolites and the pure progestin Org 2058 on PGE(2)-stimulated aromatase activity and on sulfatase activity in human ASC primary cultures and on sulfatase activity in MCF-7 and T47D cell lines. In MCF-7, tibolone and metabolites, but not Org 2058, were found to inhibit sulfatase activity. In T47D, tibolone inhibited sulfatase only at 10(-6)M, although weakly. ASC had high sulfatase activity, which was inhibited by 10(-6)M of tibolone, Org 4094 and Org 30126, but not by Org OM38 or Org 2058. Surprisingly, aromatase activity in ASC was increased by both tibolone and Org 2058 at 10(-6)M. As ligand binding assay results and immunohistochemistry indicated the absence of progesterone and estrogen receptors in ASC, these effects on aromatase and sulfatase activity in ASC likely take place by other routes. Because tibolone and its metabolites inhibit sulfatase activity, and because tibolone only increases aromatase activity at a high concentration, we conclude that effects of tibolone on the breast are probably safe.
21367676	Development and validation of a liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry procedure for the quantification of sunitinib (SU11248) and its active metabolite, N-desethyl sunitinib (SU12662), in human plasma: application to an explorative study. A sensitive, precise and accurate quantitative liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the measurement of sunitinib (SU11248) and N-desethyl sunitinib (SU12662) in human plasma was developed and validated. All sample handling was done under strict light protection. The sample preparation method employed acetonitrile protein precipitation using d(5)-SU11248 as an internal standard. The processed samples were chromatographed on a polymeric reversed-phase analytical column and analyzed by triple-quadrupole MS/MS in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode using positive TurboIonSpray® (TISP). The LC-MS/MS method described in this paper presents high absolute recovery (86.2% SU11248, 84.8% SU12662), high sensitivity (lower limit of quantitation of 0.06 ng/mL for both analytes), high inter-day precision (1.6-6.1% SU11248, 1.1-5.3% SU12662) and high analytical recovery (99.8-109.1% SU11248, 99.9-106.2% SU12662), as well as excellent linearity over the concentration range 0.060-100 ng/mL (r(2)>0.999) with a short runtime of only 4.0 min. Results on the stability of SU11248 and SU12662 in human plasma are presented. During validation plasma from intensive care patients receiving many drugs were tested for interference and incurred samples were analyzed. The method met all criteria of the EMA and FDA guidelines during validation and was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study in healthy human volunteers.
12433826	Effects of olopatadine, a new antiallergic agent, on human liver microsomal cytochrome P450 activities. Olopatadine, a new histamine H(1) receptor-selective antagonist, is a tricyclic drug containing an alkylamino moiety. Some compounds containing a similar alkylamino group form a cytochrome p450 (p450) -iron (II)-nitrosoalkane metabolite complex [metabolic intermediate complex (MIC)], thereby causing quasi-irreversible inhibition of the p450. There was concern that olopatadine might also form MICs, therefore, the present investigation was undertaken to explore this possibility. We identified the enzymes catalyzing olopatadine metabolism and investigated the effect of olopatadine on human p450 activities. During incubation with human liver microsomes in the presence of a NADPH-generating system, olopatadine was metabolized to two metabolites, M1 (N-monodemethylolopatadine) and M3 (olopatadine N-oxide) at rates of 0.330 and 2.50 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively. Troleandomycin and ketoconazole, which are both selective inhibitors of CYP3A, significantly reduced M1 formation but specific inhibitors of other p450 isozymes did not decrease M1 formation. Incubation of olopatadine with cDNA-expressed human p450 isozymes confirmed that M1 formation was almost exclusively catalyzed by CYP3A4. The formation of M3 was enhanced by N-octylamine and was inhibited by thiourea. High specific activity of M3 formation was exhibited by cDNA-expressed flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO)1 and FMO3. Olopatadine did not inhibit p450 activities when it was simultaneously incubated with substrates for different p450 isozymes. Also, p450 activities in human liver microsomes were unaffected by pretreatment with olopatadine or M1. Furthermore, spectral analysis revealed that neither olopatadine nor M1 formed an MIC. Therefore, it is unlikely that olopatadine will cause drug-drug interactions involving p450 isozymes.
23849326	Usefulness of oral loading of oxcarbazepine suspension in selected patients with epilepsy. Oral loading of oxcarbazepine tablet is effective and well tolerated to adequately achieve the therapeutic levels of its active metabolite, 10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxy-carbazepine (monohydroxy derivative, MHD) in epilepsy patients. The present study was performed to investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profiles of oral loading of oxcarbazepine suspension in epilepsy patients with a high risk of recurrent seizures. Oxcarbazepine suspension was administered orally at a single loading dose of 30 mg/kg to 38 adult patients with recurrent seizures, who required rapid seizure control or temporarily discontinued antiepileptic drugs for diagnostic or pre-surgical evaluation. Plasma concentrations of oxcarbazepine and MHD were determined, and adverse events were assessed at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 24 hours after oral loading of oxcarbazepine suspension. 30 patients experienced ≥ 1 adverse event during the first 24 hours after oral loading of oxcarbazepine (e.g., dizziness, transient diplopia, nausea or vomiting), most of which occurred within 4 hours after loading, suggesting no temporal association with MHD plasma levels. 35 (92.1%) patients were still compliant with a maintenance dose of oxcarbazepine after discharge from hospital. 34 (89.4%) patients reached the lower therapeutic level of MHD (12 mg/l) at 4 hours after oral loading of oxcarbazepine suspension, which lasted up to 24 hours in most patients. No patient reached the supratherapeutic levels of MHD (> 35 mg/l) during the study. The mean plasma concentration-time curves and pharmacokinetic profiles of oral loading of oxcarbazepine suspension were similar to those of oral loading of oxcarbazepine tablet. Oral loading of oxcarbazepine suspension followed by maintenance dosing is well tolerated and effective in steadily achieving the therapeutic level of MHD in selected patients with epilepsy.
20053817	Metabolism of intravenous methylnaltrexone in mice, rats, dogs, and humans. Methylnaltrexone (MNTX), a selective mu-opioid receptor antagonist, functions as a peripherally acting receptor antagonist in tissues of the gastrointestinal tract. This report describes the metabolic fate of [(3)H]MNTX or [(14)C]MNTX bromide in mice, rats, dogs, and humans after intravenous administration. Separation and identification of plasma and urinary MNTX metabolites was achieved by high-performance liquid chromatography-radioactivity detection and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The structures of the most abundant human metabolites were confirmed by chemical synthesis and NMR spectroscopic analysis. Analysis of radioactivity in plasma and urine showed that MNTX underwent two major pathways of metabolism in humans: sulfation of the phenolic group to MNTX-3-sulfate (M2) and reduction of the carbonyl group to two epimeric alcohols, methyl-6alpha-naltrexol (M4) and methyl-6beta-naltrexol (M5). Neither naltrexone nor its metabolite 6beta-naltrexol were detected in human plasma after administration of MNTX, confirming an earlier observation that N-demethylation was not a metabolic pathway of MNTX in humans. The urinary metabolite profiles in humans were consistent with plasma profiles. In mice, the circulating and urinary metabolites included M5, MNTX-3-glucuronide (M9), 2-hydroxy-3-O-methyl MNTX (M6), and its glucuronide (M10). M2, M5, M6, and M9 were observed in rats. Dogs produced only one metabolite, M9. In conclusion, MNTX was not extensively metabolized in humans. Conversion to methyl-6-naltrexol isomers (M4 and M5) and M2 were the primary pathways of metabolism in humans. MNTX was metabolized to a higher extent in mice than in rats, dogs, and humans. Glucuronidation was a major metabolic pathway in mice, rats, and dogs, but not in humans. Overall, the data suggested species differences in the metabolism of MNTX.
21787170	CYP2D plays a major role in berberine metabolism in liver of mice and humans. Berberine is a widely used plant extract for gastrointestinal infections, and is reported to have potential benefits in treatment for diabetes and hypercholesterolemia. It has been suggested that interactions between berberine-containing products and cytochromes P450 (CYPs) exist, but little is known about which CYPs mediate the metabolism of berberine in vivo. In this study, berberine metabolites in urine and feces of mice were analyzed, and the role that CYPs play in producing these metabolites were characterized in liver microsomes from mice (MLM) and humans (HLM), as well as recombinant human CYPs. Eleven berberine metabolites were identified in mice, including 5 unconjugated metabolites, mainly in feces, and 6 glucuronide and sulfate conjugates, predominantly in urine. Three novel berberine metabolites were observed. Three unconjugated metabolites of berberine were produced by MLM, HLM, and recombinant human CYPs. CYP2D6 was the primary recombinant human CYP producing these metabolites, followed by CYP1A2, 3A4, 2E1 and CYP2C19. The metabolism of berberine in MLM and HLM was decreased the most by a CYP2D inhibitor, and moderately by inhibitors of CYP1A and 3A. CYP2D plays a major role in berberine biotransformation, therefore, CYP2D6 pharmacogenetics and potential drug-drug interactions should be considered when berberine is used.
15256760	Effect of gamma-oryzanol on cytochrome P450 activities in human liver microsomes. The effects of gamma-oryzanol, a drug mainly used for the treatment of hyperlipidaemia, on several cytochrome P450 (CYP) specific reactions in human liver microsomes were investigated to predict drug interactions with gamma-oryzanol in vivo from in vitro data. The following eight CYP catalytic reactions were used in this study: CYP1A1/2-mediated 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation, CYP2A6-mediated coumarin 7-hydroxylation, CYP2B6-mediated 7-benzyloxyresorufin O-debenzylation, CYP2C8/9-mediated tolbutamide methylhydroxylation, CYP2C19-mediated S-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation, CYP2D6-mediated bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation, CYP2E1-mediated chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylation, and CYP3A4-mediated testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation. gamma-Oryzanol had little inhibitory effects on CYP activities, indicating that this compound would not be expected to cause clinically significant interactions with other CYP-metabolized drugs at expected therapeutic concentrations.
19940026	In vitro assessment of metabolic drug-drug interaction potential of apixaban through cytochrome P450 phenotyping, inhibition, and induction studies. Apixaban is an oral, direct, and highly selective factor Xa inhibitor in late-stage clinical development for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic diseases. The metabolic drug-drug interaction potential of apixaban was evaluated in vitro. The compound did not show cytochrome P450 inhibition (IC(50) values >20 microM) in incubations of human liver microsomes with the probe substrates of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4/5. Apixaban did not show any effect at concentrations up to 20 muM on enzyme activities or mRNA levels of selected P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, 2B6, and 3A4/5) that are sensitive to induction in incubations with primary human hepatocytes. Apixaban showed a slow metabolic turnover in incubations of human liver microsomes with formation of O-demethylation (M2) and hydroxylation products (M4 and M7) as prominent in vitro metabolites. Experiments with human cDNA-expressed P450 enzymes and P450 chemical inhibitors and correlation with P450 activities in individual human liver microsomes demonstrated that the oxidative metabolism of apixaban for formation of all metabolites was predominantly catalyzed by CYP3A4/5 with a minor contribution of CYP1A2 and CYP2J2 for formation of M2. The contribution of CYP2C8, 2C9, and 2C19 to metabolism of apixaban was less significant. In addition, a human absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion study showed that more than half of the dose was excreted as unchanged parent (f(m CYP) <0.5), thus significantly reducing the overall metabolic drug-drug interaction potential of apixaban. Together with a low clinical efficacious concentration and multiple clearance pathways, these results demonstrate that the metabolic drug-drug interaction potential between apixaban and coadministered drugs is low.
22454916	The clinical pharmacology of salmefamol. 1 The absorption, excretion and metabolism of [(3)H]-salmefamol, a new sympathomimetic bronchodilator drug, have been studied in asthmatic patients. 2 Following oral administration of 1 or 2 mg to four patients the drug was well absorbed, peak plasma levels occurring from 0.6-2.0 h after administration. An improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) (ranging from 12-50% above baseline) was seen. 3 Following aerosol administration of 0.22-0.34 mg to four patients a rapid rise in FEV(1) was seen (range 26-117%). The plasma and urinary pictures following this route were similar to those seen after oral administration, suggesting that the majority of the dose was swallowed. 4 Very little free salmefamol was found in plasma or urine, the majority being present as metabolites. Urinary radioactivity was mainly present in the form of sulphate conjugates of at least two compounds, one of which was salmefamol. The other compound has not been identified but it is suggested that it may be an active metabolite.
3958920	Metabolic fate and solubility of triamterene--not an explanation for triamterene nephrolithiasis. In an attempt to explain the triamterene stone diathesis, we studied the excretion and solubility of triamterene, 1, and its metabolite, the sulfate ester of the hydroxy derivative of triamterene, 3. The urinary excretion pattern and metabolism in stone formers was the same as in other chronic users of triamterene or healthy volunteers. The solubility of triamterene in urine was approximately one-half of its solubility in buffer solution, whereas the sulfate ester, 3, was nearly twice as soluble in urine as in the buffer solution. In the majority of the subjects studied, we found concentrations of 3 which approached or exceeded apparent solubility limits in urine. This was not true for triamterene where most measured urine concentrations were less than the apparent solubility as determined by equilibration. Alteration in the metabolism of triamterene is probably not a causative factor for triamterene nephrolithiasis. The saturation of urine with triamterene and especially with the sulfate ester, 3, may be related to stone formation, but other physical factors play a role in determining the relative amounts of drug found in calculus material.
760598	Volatile metabolites and decomposition products of halothane in man. The presence of two volatile halothane metabolites, 2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane (CF3CH2Cl) and 2-chloro-1,1-difluoroethylene (CF2CHCl), and a metabolite-decomposition product, 2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1-difluoroethylene (CF2CBrCl), were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in exhaled gases of 16 patients anesthetized with halothane in nonrebreathing, semiclosed and totally closed anesthesia circuits. No significant differences in concentrations of CF3CH2Cl and CF2CHCl were found relative to the anesthesia circuits used. CF2CBrCl could not be identified in the expired gases of patients anesthetized with a nonrebreathing circuit (Bain), but was present in gases recovered from both semiclosed and totally closed circuits. Under totally closed-circuit rebreathing conditions, the concentration of CF2CBrCl increased to 4-5 ppm, indicating significant breakdown of halothane by the soda lime. Possible pathways for formation of the two metabolites and the metabolite-decomposition product are presented, as well as clinical implications of these findings.
19661559	Doping control analysis of metamfepramone and two major metabolites using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The sympathomimetic agent metamfepramone (2-dimethylamino-1-phenylpropan-1-one, dimethylpropion) is widely used for the treatment of the common cold or hypotonic conditions. Due to its stimulating properties and its rapid metabolism resulting in major degradation products such as methylpseudoephedrine and methcathinone, it has been considered relevant for doping controls by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). The rapid degradation of the active drug complicates the detection of metamfepramone itself but the metabolites methylpseudoephedrine and methcathinone can be monitored, and the finding of the latter in particular allows the inference of a metamfepramone administration. In order to improve sports drug testing procedures, metamfepramone, methylpseudoephedrine and methcathinone were characterized using electrospray ionization-high resolution/high accuracy mass spectrometry, and a method employing liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry was established that allowed the analysis of these three analytes by direct injection of 2 microL of urine specimens. The assay was validated with regard to specificity, lower limits of detection (2-10 ng mL(-1)), intraday and interday precision (3-17%) and ion suppression/enhancement effects. The developed procedure has been used to verify or falsify suspicious signals observed in routine screening procedures based on gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and yielded an adverse analytical finding concerning a metamfepramone administration in an authentic doping control sample. Although the active drug was not detected, the indicative metabolites methylpseudoephedrine and methcathinone were considered sufficient to infer the application of the prohibited drug.
17427179	Inhibition of fipronil and nonane metabolism in human liver microsomes and human cytochrome P450 isoforms by chlorpyrifos. Previous studies have established that chlorpyrifos (CPS), fipronil, and nonane can all be metabolized by human liver microsomes (HLM) and a number of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms. However, metabolic interactions between these three substrates have not been described. In this study the effect of either coincubation or preincubation of CPS with HLM or CYP isoforms with either fipronil or nonane as substrate was investigated. In both co- and preincubation experiments, CPS significantly inhibited the metabolism of fipronil or nonane by HLM although CPS inhibited the metabolism of fipronil more effectively than that of nonane. CPS significantly inhibited the metabolism of fipronil by CYP3A4 as well as the metabolism of nonane by CYP2B6. In both cases, preincubation with CPS caused greater inhibition than coincubation, suggesting that the inhibition is mechanism based.
23268924	Effects of green tea catechins on cytochrome P450 2B6, 2C8, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A activities in human liver and intestinal microsomes. The effects of green tea catechins on the main drug-metabolizing enzymatic system, cytochrome P450 (CYP), have not been fully elucidated. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of green tea extract (GTE, total catechins 86.5%, w/w) and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on the activities of CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A in vitro, using pooled human liver and intestinal microsomes. Bupropion hydroxylation, amodiaquine N-deethylation, (S)-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation, dextromethorphan O-demethylation and midazolam 1'-hydroxylation were assessed in the presence or absence of various concentrations of GTE and EGCG to test their effects on CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A activities, respectively. Each metabolite was quantified using UPLC/ESI-MS, and the inhibition kinetics of GTE and EGCG on CYP enzymes was analyzed. In human liver microsomes, IC50 values of GTE were 5.9, 4.5, 48.7, 25.1 and 13.8 µg/mL, for CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A, respectively. ECGC also inhibited these CYP isoforms with properties similar to those of GTE, and produced competitive inhibitions against CYP2B6 and CYP2C8, and noncompetitive inhibition against CYP3A. In human intestinal microsomes, IC50 values of GTE and EGCG for CYP3A were 18.4 µg/mL and 31.1 µM, respectively. EGCG moderately inhibited CYP3A activity in a noncompetitive manner. These results suggest that green tea catechins cause clinically relevant interactions with substrates for CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 in addition to CYP3A.
8329293	Moclobemide treatment causes a substantial rise in the sparteine metabolic ratio. Danish University Antidepressant Group. A sparteine test was carried out immediately before (n = 37) and during (n = 33) moclobemide treatment (200 mg twice daily) in 37 patients participating in a controlled clinical trial. The sparteine metabolic ratio (MR) did not correlate with the plasma concentration of moclobemide and/or its oxidized metabolite Ro 12-8095, and four sparteine poor metabolisers (PM, MR > 20) had plasma moclobemide concentrations similar to those in extensive metabolisers (EM, MR < 20). The Ro 12-8095/moclobemide ratio tended to correlate negatively with the sparteine MR before and during treatment (rs = -0.32, -0.37). During moclobemide treatment the sparteine MR rose substantially by a factor of 1-103 (median 4.7), and two EM became phenotypically PM. In the PM subjects as well as in one EM patient on cimetidine during both tests, no change in sparteine MR occurred.
19258444	A population pharmacokinetic meta-analysis of sunitinib malate (SU11248) and its primary metabolite (SU12662) in healthy volunteers and oncology patients. Sunitinib malate is an oral multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for advanced renal cell carcinoma and imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Following administration, sunitinib is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 to an active metabolite (SU12662). The objective of this analysis was to assess sunitinib and SU12662 pharmacokinetics and to identify covariates that might explain variability in exposure following oral administration. Data from 590 subjects (73 volunteers and 517 patients) in 14 studies were analyzed. Plasma concentration-time data were analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling to estimate population pharmacokinetic parameters, as well as relationships between these parameters and gender, race, age, weight, creatinine clearance, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score, and tumor type. Simulations were done to determine the predicted effect of these covariates on exposure. Separate models were developed for sunitinib and SU12662 (each a two-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination). Sunitinib parameters were estimated as CL/F, 51.8 L/h and Vd/F(central), 2,030 liters. SU12662 parameters were estimated as CL/F, 29.6 L/h and Vd/F(central), 3,080 liters. Tumor type (except acute myeloid leukemia), Asian race, gender, body weight, and elevated Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score described a portion of the variability in CL/F for sunitinib and metabolite; gender and body weight explained some of the variability in Vd/F(central) for sunitinib and metabolite. Among patients, the predicted changes in sunitinib and metabolite AUC and C(max) as a result of the individual covariates ranged up to 17%. The magnitude of the predicted changes in exposure with the covariates studied minimizes the necessity for dose adjustment in any of these subpopulations.
19371322	Lack of age and gender effects on single-dose pharmacokinetics of tomopenem (RO4908463/CS-023), a novel carbapenem. To investigate the effect of age and gender on the tolerability, safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of tomopenem (RO4908463/CS-023), a novel carbapenem antibiotic, and its major metabolite. Forty-two subjects were assigned to one of the following three groups: young men, elderly men and elderly women. The PK, safety and tolerability of an intravenous infusion of 1500 mg tomopenem and its resultant major metabolite (open beta-lactam ring) were assessed. Minor differences in exposure of both tomopenem and the major metabolite were seen. The area under the curve (AUC) of tomopenem was 22% higher in elderly men compared with young men, and 19% higher in elderly women relative to the elderly men. Total clearance of tomopenem decreased with decreasing creatinine clearance. In the two male groups, renal clearance values of tomopenem were similar (3.52 and 3.67 l h(-1)) and higher than in the elderly female group (2.83 l h(-1)). The mean half-lives ranged from 2.03 (healthy young men) to 2.41 h (elderly men). The difference in AUC of tomopenem can be explained by differences in the mean creatinine clearances of 116 (young men), 101 (elderly men) and 84.7 (elderly women) ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2), respectively. While some PK parameters were statistically different among the three groups, the differences were mostly minor and unlikely to be clinically meaningful. The difference in the PK can be largely attributed to the difference in creatinine clearance of these groups.
17676709	Simultaneous determination of atracurium and its metabolite laudanosine in post-mortem fluids by liquid chromatography/multiple-stage mass spectrometry on an ion trap. A method was developed to accurately quantify atracurium (a non-depolarizing skeletal muscle relaxant) and its metabolite laudanosine in post-mortem specimens. Analytes were isolated from blood and tissues by liquid/liquid extraction after adding vecuronium as an internal standard. Chromatographic separation was accomplished by gradient elution in a Synergy Max RP 150 x 2.1 mm column. Positive ion electrospray ionization and mass spectrometric analyses were carried out in an ion trap mass spectrometer under collision-induced dissociation conditions. The method proved selective and sensitive, and was validated in post-mortem blood, heart, lung and liver in the range of 1-2000 ng/mL (blood) and 5-5000 ng/g (tissues); the limits of quantification obtained were 1 ng/mL in blood and 5 ng/g in tissues.
11805197	Amodiaquine clearance and its metabolism to N-desethylamodiaquine is mediated by CYP2C8: a new high affinity and turnover enzyme-specific probe substrate. Amodiaquine (AQ) metabolism to N-desethylamodiaquine (DEAQ) is the principal route of disposition in humans. Using human liver microsomes and two sets of recombinant human cytochrome P450 isoforms (from lymphoblastoids and yeast) we performed studies to identify the CYP isoform(s) involved in the metabolism of AQ. CYP2C8 was the main hepatic isoform that cleared AQ and catalyzed the formation of DEAQ. The extrahepatic P450s, 1A1 and 1B1, also cleared AQ and catalyzed the formation of an unknown metabolite M2. The K(m) and V(max) values for AQ N-desethylation were 1.2 microM and 2.6 pmol/min/pmol of CYP2C8 for recombinant CYP2C8, and 2.4 microM and 1462 pmol/min/mg of protein for human liver microsomes (HLMs), respectively. Relative contribution of CYP2C8 in the formation of DEAQ was estimated at 100% using the relative activity factor method. Correlation analyses between AQ metabolism and the activities of eight hepatic P450s were made on 10 different HLM samples. Both the formation of DEAQ and the clearance of AQ showed excellent correlations (r(2) = 0.98 and 0.95) with 6alpha-hydroxylation of paclitaxel, a marker substrate for CYP2C8. The inhibition of DEAQ formation by quercetin was competitive with K(i) values of 1.96 for CYP2C8 and 1.56 microM for HLMs. Docking of AQ into the active site homology models of the CYP2C isoforms showed favorable interactions with CYP2C8, which supported the likelihood of an N-desethylation reaction. These data show that CYP2C8 is the main hepatic isoform responsible for the metabolism of AQ. The specificity, high affinity, and high turnover make AQ desethylation an excellent marker reaction for CYP2C8 activity.
11414684	Covalent alteration of the CYP3A4 active site: evidence for multiple substrate binding domains. The inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated oxidation of triazolam and testosterone was assessed in the presence of a selection of known CYP3A4 substrates and inhibitors. Under experimental conditions where the Michaelis-Menten model predicts substrate-independent inhibition ([S] = K(m)), results yielded substrate-dependent inhibition. Moreover, when the same experimental design was extended to a group of structurally similar flavonoids it was observed that flavanone, flavone, 3-hydroxyflavone, and 6-hydroxyflavone (10 microM) activated triazolam metabolism, but inhibited testosterone hydroxylation. In additional studies, residual CYP3A4 activity toward testosterone and triazolam hydroxylation was measured after pretreatment with the CYP3A4 mechanism based inhibitor, midazolam. After midazolam preincubation, CYP3A4 6 beta-hydroxylase activity was reduced by 47% while, in contrast, triazolam hydroxylation was reduced by 75%. These results provide physical evidence, which supports the hypothesis that the active site of CYP3A4 contains spatially distinct substrate-binding domains within the enzyme active site.
17011523	Identification of glyburide metabolites formed by hepatic and placental microsomes of humans and baboons. Glyburide (glibenclamide) is a second-generation sulfonylurea used for treatment of type-2 and gestational diabetes mellitus. To date, two glyburide metabolites have been identified in maternal urine: namely, 4-trans-hydroxycyclohexyl glyburide and 3-cis-hydroxycyclohexyl glyburide. The use of glyburide to treat gestational diabetes prompted us to investigate its metabolism by the placenta. The metabolism of glyburide by microsomal preparations from human and baboon placenta was compared with metabolism by their livers. The metabolites formed by the microsomes of the four tissues were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry using retention times, ion current (extracted at m/z 510), and selected-ion monitoring. The data obtained revealed the formation of six distinct hydroxylated derivatives of glyburide by each of the four microsomal preparations. However, the amounts of the six metabolites formed by the placentas were a fraction of that formed by the livers. Moreover, the relative quantities of each metabolite formed differed between species as well as between the two tissues. Also, the structure of the unidentified metabolites was determined by comparison with synthesized standards. These metabolites were identified as the 4-cis-hydroxycyclohexyl glyburide, 3-trans-hydroxycyclohexyl glyburide, and 2-trans-hydroxycyclohexyl glyburide. Therefore, one glyburide metabolite remains to be identified, but the data we obtained allowed us to suggest its structure.
19439489	Identification of human metabolites of (-)-N-{2-[(R)-3-(6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-2-carbonyl)piperidino]ethyl}-4-fluorobenzamide (YM758), a novel If channel inhibitor, and investigation of the transporter-mediated renal and hepatic excretion of these metabolites. (-)-N-{2-[(R)-3-(6,7-Dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-2-carbonyl)piperidino]ethyl}-4-fluorobenzamide (YM758) is a novel inhibitor of the "funny" If current channel (If channel) that is expressed in the sinus node of heart and is being developed as a treatment for stable angina and atrial fibrillation. Its metabolites were identified in human urine, plasma, and feces by radio-high-performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses after oral administration of [(14)C]YM758. 6,7-Dimethoxy-2-[(3R)-piperidin-3-ylcarbonyl]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (YM-252124), (5R)-5-[(6,7-dimethoxy-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-2(1H)-yl)carbonyl]piperidin-2-one (YM-385459), 2-{[(3R)-1-{2-[(4-fluorobenzoyl)amino]ethyl}piperidin-3-yl]carbonyl}-7-methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisonolin-6-yl beta-D-glucopyranosiduronic acid (AS2036329), and the unchanged drug were detected as major constituents in both urine and plasma, whereas N-(4-fluorobenzoyl)glycine (YM-385461) was detected in plasma, but not in urine. The renal and hepatic uptake transporters for these metabolites were investigated by assessing their inhibitory effect on uptake activity in human (h) organic cation transporter (OCT) 1-3/rat (r) Oct1-3, human organic anion transporter (OAT) 1/rOat1, hOAT3/rOat3, and organic anion-transporting protein 1B1/1B3-expressing HEK293 cells. IC(50) values of YM-252124 for 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium uptake via hOCT2 and rOct2 were 93.9 and 1700 microM, respectively, suggesting that this metabolite is secreted into urine via hOCT2/rOct2 and that the large difference in the inhibitory potentials between hOCT2 and rOct2 explains the species difference in the urinary excretion ratio of the radioactivity. The renal secretion of YM-385461, one derivative of p-aminohippuric acid, via hOAT1/rOat1, and hepatic uptake of YM-252124 via hOCT1/rOct1 was also expected. This kind of study was useful in investigating the relationship between the urinary/hepatic elimination and the transport activity for metabolites.
20668249	Metabolism and disposition of [14C]BMS-690514, an ErbB/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor, after oral administration to humans. (3R,4R)-4-Amino-1-((4-((3-methoxyphenyl)amino)pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-5-yl)methyl)-3-piperidinol (BMS-690514), an oral selective inhibitor of human epidermal growth factor receptors 1 (or epidermal growth factor receptor), 2, and 4, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2, and 3, is being developed as a treatment for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer and metastatic breast cancer. The disposition of [(14)C]BMS-690514 was investigated in nine healthy male subjects (group 1, n = 6; group 2, n = 3) after oral administration of a 200-mg dose. Urine, feces, and plasma were collected from all subjects for up to 12 days postdose. In group 2 subjects, bile was collected from 3 to 8 h postdose. Across groups, approximately 50 and 34% of administered radioactivity was recovered in the feces and urine, respectively. An additional 16% was recovered in the bile of group 2 subjects. Less than 28% of the dose was recovered as parent drug in the combined excreta, suggesting that BMS-690514 was highly metabolized. BMS-690514 was rapidly absorbed (median time of maximum observed concentration 0.5 h) with the absorbed fraction estimated to be approximately 50 to 68%. BMS-690514 represented ≤7.9% of the area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinite time of plasma radioactivity, indicating that the majority of the circulating radioactivity was from metabolites. BMS-690514 was metabolized via multiple oxidation reactions and direct glucuronidation. Circulating metabolites included a hydroxylated rearrangement product (M1), a direct ether glucuronide (M6), and multiple secondary glucuronide conjugates. None of these metabolites is expected to contribute to the pharmacology of BMS-690514. In summary, BMS-690514 was well absorbed and extensively metabolized via multiple metabolic pathways in humans, with excretion of drug-related radioactivity in both bile and urine.
19960413	Inhibitory effects of deoxypodophyllotoxin from Anthriscus sylvestris on human CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. Deoxypodophyllotoxin (DPT) is a bioactive compound of Anthriscus sylvestris (Apiaceae). In the present study, the inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) by DPT was evaluated in human liver microsomes (HLM) and the baculovirus-insect cell-expressed human CYPs using a cocktail probe assay. When a mixture of specific CYP substrates was incubated with DPT in HLM, CYP2C9-catalyzed diclofenac 4-hydroxylation and CYP3A4-catalyzed midazolam 1-hydroxylation were strongly inhibited by DPT, with IC (50) values of 6.3 and 9.2 microM, respectively. The Lineweaver-Burke plots for the inhibition of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 in HLM and baculovirus-insect cell-expressed human CYPs were consistent with a competitive type of inhibition. From these results, DPT was characterized to be a competitive inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, with K(i) values of 3.5 and 10.8 microM in HLM and 24.9 and 3.5 microM in baculovirus-insect cell-expressed human CYPs, respectively.
8730919	Inhibition of cyclosporine and tetrahydrocannabinol metabolism by cannabidiol in mouse and human microsomes. 1. The in vitro and in vivo effects of cannabidiol on mouse and human liver microsomal metabolism of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine and the psychoactive compound tetrahydrocannabinol have been examined. 2. Preincubation of mouse or human liver microsomes with cannabidiol decreased the formation of all detectable cyclosporine metabolites by 73-89%. 3. In vivo cannabidiol treatment of mouse similarly decreased the formation of all detectable cyclosporine metabolites by 60-86%. 4. Preincubation of human liver microsomes with cannabidiol selectively decreased the formation of tetrahydrocannabinol metabolites catalyzed by cytochrome P4503A by 60% but had no effect on P4502C9-catalyzed metabolites. 5. Cannabidiol has the potential to clinically affect cyclosporine metabolism which may result in increased cyclosporine blood levels and an increase in its toxic side effects, and likewise may also affect tetrahydrocannabinol and its metabolite levels in man.
16516181	Consequences of quercetin methylation for its covalent glutathione and DNA adduct formation. This study investigates the pro-oxidant activity of 3'- and 4'-O-methylquercetin, two relevant phase II metabolites of quercetin without a functional catechol moiety, which is generally thought to be important for the pro-oxidant activity of quercetin. Oxidation of 3'- and 4'-O-methylquercetin with horseradish peroxidase in the presence of glutathione yielded two major metabolites for each compound, identified as the 6- and 8-glutathionyl conjugates of 3'- and 4'-O-methylquercetin. Thus, catechol-O-methylation of quercetin does not eliminate its pro-oxidant chemistry. Furthermore, the formation of these A-ring glutathione conjugates of 3'- and 4'-O-methylquercetin indicates that quercetin o-quinone may not be an intermediate in the formation of covalent quercetin adducts with glutathione, protein and/or DNA. In additional studies, it was demonstrated that covalent DNA adduct formation by a mixture of [4-(14)C]-3'- and 4'-O-methylquercetin in HepG2 cells amounted to only 42% of the level of covalent adducts formed by a similar amount of [4-(14)C]-quercetin. Altogether, these results reveal the effect of methylation of the catechol moiety of quercetin on its pro-oxidant behavior. Methylation of quercetin does not eliminate but considerably attenuates the cellular implications of the pro-oxidant activity of quercetin, which might add to the mechanisms underlying the apparent lack of in vivo carcinogenicity of this genotoxic compound. The paper also presents a new mechanism for the pro-oxidant chemistry of quercetin, eliminating the requirement for formation of an o-quinone, and explaining why methylation of the catechol moiety does not fully abolish formation of reactive DNA binding metabolites.
19812352	Identification of multiple glutathione conjugates of 8-amino- 2-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline maleate (nomifensine) in liver microsomes and hepatocyte preparations: evidence of the bioactivation of nomifensine. 8-Amino-2-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline maleate (nomifensine), an antidepressant drug, was withdrawn from the market because of increased incidence of hemolytic anemia, as well as kidney and liver toxicity. Although the nature of the potentially reactive metabolites formed after nomifensine metabolism remains unknown and no glutathione (GSH) adducts of these nomifensine reactive metabolites have been reported, bioactivation has been postulated as a potential mechanism for the toxicity of nomifensine. This study was conducted to probe the potential bioactivation pathways of nomifensine in human and animal hepatocytes and in liver microsomes using GSH as a trapping agent. Two types of GSH conjugates were characterized by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry: 1) aniline oxidation followed by GSH conjugation leading to the formation of nomifensine-GSH sulfinamides (M1 and M2); and 2) arene oxidation followed by GSH conjugation yielding a range of arene C-linked GSH adducts (M3-M9). Nine GSH adducts (M1-M9) were identified in liver microsomes of humans, dogs, monkeys, and rats and in human and rat hepatocytes. In dog hepatocyte preparations, six GSH adducts (M1-M6) were identified. The GSH adducts in dog and rat liver microsomes were formed primarily through aniline and arene oxidation, respectively. Both pathways contributed significantly to the formation of the GSH adducts in human and monkey liver microsomes. The bioactivation pathways proposed here account for the formation of the observed GSH conjugates. These investigations have confirmed the aniline and the arene groups in nomifensine as potential toxicophores capable of generating reactive intermediates.
19874648	Oxycodone-related fatalities in the west of Scotland. The intent of this study was to review fatalities involving oxycodone in the west of Scotland using a liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry method developed for the determination of oxycodone and N- and O-demethylated metabolites in unhydrolyzed postmortem specimens. Ten oxycodone positive postmortem cases were detected, and nine were drug-related fatalities. Five cases were attributed solely to oxycodone intoxication and four to polydrug intoxication. Although there was overlap between blood oxycodone levels in deaths attributed to oxycodone only and those due to polydrug intoxication, lower oxycodone levels (< 1 mg/L) were associated with polydrug intoxication when compared with cases due to oxycodone alone (> 1 mg/L). The role of the parent drug in oxycodone fatalities has been fully studied, but the role of oxycodone metabolites (noroxycodone and oxymorphone) was investigated in this report for the first time. Oxycodone was more commonly detected in blood, urine, and vitreous humor followed by noroxycodone. The ratio between oxycodone and its N-demethylated metabolite was evaluated and found to be useful in determining whether death occurred shortly after drug administration or if there was a significant delay. High parent/metabolite ratios were correlated with short survival times after ingestion. The median ratio of oxycodone/noroxycodone was 2.4 and ranged from 0.7 to 49. Oxycodone prescriptions have risen sharply in Scotland in recent years, and the identification of 10 oxycodone-related deaths in the past 18 months highlights the importance of including this drug in routine laboratory screening and confirmation procedures.
18563956	Pharmacokinetics and tolerability of intramuscular, oral and intravenous aripiprazole in healthy subjects and in patients with schizophrenia. Patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder who are experiencing acute behavioural emergencies often require intramuscular injection of antipsychotics for rapid symptom resolution. The efficacy and tolerability of intramuscular aripiprazole injection has been established in agitated inpatients with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder. The main objective of the two clinical pharmacology studies reported here was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole after intramuscular dosing in healthy subjects and in patients with schizophrenia, and after intravenous and oral dosing in healthy subjects. Study 1 was an open-label, randomized, three-treatment crossover study in healthy subjects (n = 18) to assess the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of intramuscular aripiprazole 5 mg and oral aripiprazole 5 mg relative to intravenous aripiprazole 2 mg. Study 2 was an open-label, nonrandomized, escalating-dose study in patients with schizophrenia (n = 32) to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of intramuscular aripiprazole across a range of doses (from 1 mg to 45 mg). The noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters for plasma concentrations of aripiprazole and its active metabolite dehydro-aripiprazole were determined. Safety and tolerability data are also summarized. In study 1, the geometric mean values for the absolute bioavailability of aripiprazole following oral and intramuscular administration were 0.85 and 0.98, respectively. Intramuscular aripiprazole demonstrated more rapid attainment of plasma aripiprazole concentrations than oral aripiprazole (78% and 5% of peak plasma concentration [C(max)] values at 0.5 hours postdose, respectively). The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) in the first 2 hours was 90% higher after intramuscular administration than after oral administration. For dehydro-aripiprazole, the AUC over the collection interval values were higher, the times to reach the C(max) values were later and the C(max) values were similar for the intramuscular and oral formulations. In study 2, the proportionality of the C(max) and AUC to doses ranging from 1 mg to 45 mg suggests a linear pharmacokinetic profile for intramuscular aripiprazole. More rapid absorption was observed following intramuscular aripiprazole injection than following oral dosing. These results support the recently reported efficacy of intramuscular aripiprazole for managing agitation in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder.
14699462	Malabsorption of rifampin and isoniazid in HIV-infected patients with and without tuberculosis. The absorption of rifampin, isoniazid, and D-xylose in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and diarrhea, in patients with HIV infection and tuberculosis (TB), in patients with pulmonary TB alone, and in healthy subjects was studied. Percentage of dose of the drugs, their metabolites, and D-xylose excreted in urine were calculated. A significant reduction in the absorption of drugs and D-xylose in both the HIV infection/diarrhea and HIV infection/TB groups was observed (P<.05), and the correlation between them was significant. Our results indicate that patients with HIV infection and diarrhea and those with HIV infection and TB have malabsorption of rifampin and isoniazid.
23065531	Metabolism and quantification of [(18)F]DPA-714, a new TSPO positron emission tomography radioligand. [(18)F]DPA-714 [N,N-diethyl-2-(2-(4-(2[(18)F]-fluoroethoxy)phenyl)5,7dimethylpyrazolo[1,5a]pyrimidin-3-yl)acetamide] is a new radioligand currently used for imaging the 18-kDa translocator protein in animal models of neuroinflammation and recently in humans. The biodistribution by positron emission tomography (PET) in baboons and the in vitro and in vivo metabolism of [(18)F]DPA-714 were investigated in rats, baboons, and humans. Whole-body PET experiments showed a high uptake of radioactivity in the kidneys, heart, liver, and gallbladder. The liver was a major route of elimination of [(18)F]DPA-714, and urine was a route of excretion for radiometabolites. In rat and baboon plasma, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) metabolic profiles showed three major radiometabolites accounting for 85% and 89% of total radioactivity at 120 minutes after injection, respectively. Rat microsomal incubations and analyses by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) identified seven metabolites, characterized as O-deethyl, hydroxyl, and N-deethyl derivatives of nonradioactive DPA-714, two of them having the same retention times than those detected in rat and baboon plasma. The third plasma radiometabolite was suggested to be a carboxylic acid compound that accounted for 15% of the rat brain radioactivity. O-deethylation led to a nonradioactive compound and [(18)F]fluoroacetic acid. Human CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 were shown to be involved in the oxidation of the radioligand. Finally an easy, rapid, and accurate method--indispensable for PET quantitative clinical studies--for quantifying [(18)F]DPA-714 by solid-phase extraction was developed. In vivo, an extensive metabolism of [(18)F]DPA-714 was observed in rats and baboons, identified as [(18)F]deethyl, [(18)F]hydroxyl, and [(18)F]carboxylic acid derivatives of [(18)F]DPA-714. The main route of excretion of the unchanged radioligand in baboons was hepatobiliary while that of radiometabolites was the urinary system.
12351144	In vitro and in vivo formation of aminophenylnorharman from norharman and aniline. Norharman is not mutagenic to Salmonella strains, but becomes so to S. typhimurium TA98 and YG1024 with S9 mix in the presence of the non-mutagenic aromatic amine, aniline. The mutagenicity from norharman and aniline in the presence of S9 mix is reported to be due to formation of a mutagenic compound, 9-(4'-aminophenyl)-9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole (aminophenylnorharman, APNH). In the present study, we examined which enzymes might be involved in in vitro formation of APNH from norharman and aniline. When norharman (5mg) and aniline (2.5mg) were incubated with S9 mix, the S9 fraction of which was prepared from the livers of rats treated with phenobarbital (PB) and beta-naphthoflavone (beta-NF), at 37 degrees C for 20 min, 496 ng of APNH was produced. Formation of APNH was also detected with the microsomal fraction, but not with the cytosol fraction. The addition of a p450 inhibitor, SKF-525A, to the reaction mixture at a dose of 5mM resulted in a decrease of APNH formation, to around 40% of the control level. These results suggest involvement of p450 enzyme(s) in the formation of APNH from norharman and aniline. Moreover, a microsomal fraction from human liver was demonstrated to have the capacity to produce APNH from norharman and aniline, similar to the case with the microsomal fraction from rat liver. When norharman (90 mg/kg) and aniline (90 mg/kg) were administered to rats by gavage, APNH could be detected in the urine, at a rate of 19.6 ng+/-16.9 ng per 24h. The level was increased by treatment of the urine samples with hydrochloric acid, suggesting some APNH was excreted into urine as conjugated forms. Thus, it is likely that APNH may be produced from norharman and aniline in the human body.
3751114	Effects of brotizolam on mixed-function oxidases and glutathione metabolism in the rat. Intra-gastric administration of brotizolam (0.1-200 mg/kg) daily for three days to rats resulted in no significant changes in the hepatic and intestinal cytochrome P-450-dependent or P-448-dependent mixed-function oxidases, or in the hepatic flavoprotein dimethylaniline N-oxidase. Liver microsomes from mouse, rat and man metabolized brotizolam by hydroxylation of the diazepine ring and of the methyl group at rates which were greater for mouse greater than rat greater than man. Brotizolam and its metabolites generated by rat-liver microsomes in vitro were not mutagenic in the Ames' test. Brotizolam, at 200 mg/kg per day for two to six weeks, depleted liver glutathione concentration and markedly increased liver gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, glutathione reductase and glutathione transferase activities. Similar changes were not seen at the lower dose of 0.3 mg/kg. The observed increases in glutathione metabolism and the decreased tissue concentration of glutathione are indicative of high levels of glutathione conjugation, and provide a possible explanation for the equivocal increase in tumorigenicity seen in rats receiving brotizolam at high dosage.
18976871	Case report: Etizolam and its major metabolites in two unnatural death cases. A simultaneous analytical method for etizolam and its main metabolites (alpha-hydroxyetizolam and 8-hydroxyetizolam) in whole blood was developed using solid-phase extraction, TMS derivatization and ion trap gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). Separation of etizolam, TMS derivatives of alpha-hydroxyetizolam and 8-hydroxyetizolam and fludiazepam as internal standard was performed within about 17 min. The inter-day precision evaluated at the concentration of 50 ng/mL etizolam, alpha-hydroxyetizolam and 8-hydroxyetizolam was evaluated 8.6, 6.4 and 8.0% respectively. Linearity occurred over the range in 5-50 ng/mL. This method is satisfactory for clinical and forensic purposes. This method was applied to two unnatural death cases suspected to involve etizolam. Etizolam and its two metabolites were detected in these cases.
21622942	Characterization of novel ligands of ERα, Erβ, and PPARγ: the case of halogenated bisphenol A and their conjugated metabolites. The capability of the flame retardants tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) and tetrachlorobisphenol A (TCBPA) to activate peroxysome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) α, β, and γ and estrogen receptors (ERs) α and β has been recently investigated, but the activity of their biotransformation products and of their lower molecular weight analogues formed in the environment remains unexplored. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the degree of halogenation of BPA analogues and their affinity and activity towards human PPARγ and ERs and to characterize active metabolites of major marketed halogenated bisphenols. The biological activity of all compounds was studied using reporter cell lines expressing these nuclear receptors (NRs). We used NR-based affinity columns to rapidly evaluate the binding affinity of halogenated bisphenols for PPARγ and ERs and to trap active metabolites of TBBPA and TCBPA formed in HepG2 cells. The agonistic potential of BPA analogs highly depends on their halogenation degree: the bulkier halogenated BPA analogs, the greater their capability to activate PPARγ. In addition, PPARγ-based affinity column, HGELN-PPARγ reporter cell line and crystallographic analysis clearly demonstrate that the sulfation pathway, usually considered as a detoxification process, leads for TBBPA and TCBPA, to the formation of sulfate conjugates which possess a residual PPARγ-binding activity. Our results highlight the effectiveness NR-based affinity columns to trap and characterize biologically active compounds from complex matrices. Polyhalogenated bisphenols, but also some of their metabolites, are potential disrupters of PPARγ activity.
23001793	Stereoselective interaction between tetrahydropalmatine enantiomers and CYP enzymes in human liver microsomes. Tetrahydropalmatine (THP), with one chiral center, is an alkaloid that possesses analgesic and many other pharmacological actives. The aim of the present study is to investigate stereoselective metabolism of THP enantiomers in human liver microsomes (HLM) and elucidate which cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms contribute to the stereoselective metabolism in HLM. Additionally, the inhibitions of THP enantiomers on activity of CYP enzymes are also investigated. The results demonstrated that (+)-THP was preferentially metabolized by HLM. Ketoconazole (inhibitor of CYP3A4/5) inhibited metabolism of (-)-THP or (+)-THP at same degree, whereas the inhibition of fluvoxamine (inhibitor of CYP1A2) on metabolism of (+)-THP was greater than that of (-)-THP; moreover, the metabolic rate of (+)-THP was 5.3-fold of (-)-THP in recombinant human CYP1A2. Meanwhile, THP enantiomers did not show obvious inhibitory effect on the activity of various CYP isoforms (CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2E1, and 3A4/5), whereas (-)-THP, but not (+)-THP, significantly inhibited the activity of CYP2D6 with the Ki value of 6.42 ± 0.38 μM. The results suggested that THP enantiomers were predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4/5 and CYP1A2 in HLM, and (+)-THP was preferentially metabolized by CYP1A2, whereas CYP3A4/5 contributed equally to metabolism of (-)-THP or (+)-THP. Besides, the inhibition of CYP2D6 by (-)-THP may cause drug-drug interaction, which should be considered.
16488523	Analysis of enterolignan glucuronides in serum and urine by HPLC-ESI-MS. A method involving the coupling of high-performance liquid chromatography with electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS) for the quantitative determination of the mammalian lignans enterolactone and enterodiol in human blood and urine has been developed. In contrast to techniques previously published, the method allows direct measurement of free enterolignans as well as their monoglucuronide conjugates in human biofluids with minimal sample preparation. Thereby the method is suitable for large-scale intervention, case-control and epidemiologic studies. Comprehensive, high-precision (1)H and (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance data (CD3OD as solvent) obtained at 11.7 T in combination with polarimetric data show that the major form of lignan precursor in the linseeds used is (-)-secoisolariciresinol diglucoside ((2R,3R)-2,3-bis(4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxy-benzyl)-1,4-butanediyl-bis-beta-d-glucopyranoside) which is transformed by human intestinal bacteria into (+)-enterodiol and (+)-enterolactone. However, these metabolites are mono-glucuronidated after absorption and are detected as (-)-enterodiol 3'-beta-d-glucuronide=(2R,3R)-2-(3'-O-(beta-d-glucopyranosyluronic acid)benzyl)-3-(3''-hydroxybenzyl)-butane-1,4,diol and (-)-enterolactone 3'-beta-d-glucuronide=(2R,3R)-2-(3'-O-(beta-d-glucopyranosyluronic acid)benzyl)-3-(3''-hydroxybenzyl)-beta-butyrolactone in blood and urine.
15104117	Metabolism of ethylbenzene by human liver microsomes and recombinant human cytochrome P450s (CYP). The enzyme kinetics of the initial hydroxylation of ethylbenzene to form 1-phenylethanol were determined in human liver microsomes. The individual cytochrome P450 (CYP) forms catalysing this reaction were identified using selective inhibitors and recombinant preparations of hepatic CYPs. Production of 1-phenylethanol in hepatic microsomes exhibited biphasic kinetics with a high affinity, low Km, component (mean Km = 8 microM; V(max) = 689 pmol/min/mg protein; n = 6 livers) and a low affinity, high Km, component (Km = 391 microM; V(max) = 3039 pmol/min/mg protein; n = 6). The high-affinity component was inhibited 79%-95% (mean 86%) by diethyldithiocarbamate, and recombinant CYP2E1 was shown to metabolise ethylbenzene with low Km (35 microM), but also low (max) (7 pmol/min/pmol P450), indicating that this isoform catalysed the high-affinity component. Recombinant CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 exhibited high V(max) (88 and 71 pmol/min/pmol P450, respectively) and high Km (502 and 219 microM, respectively), suggesting their involvement in catalysing the low-affinity component. This study has demonstrated that CYP2E1 is the major enzyme responsible for high-affinity side chain hydroxylation of ethylbenzene in human liver microsomes. Activity of this enzyme in the population is highly variable due to induction or inhibition by physiological factors, chemicals in the diet or some pharmaceuticals. This variability can be incorporated into the risk assessment process to improve the setting of occupational exposure limits and guidance values for biological monitoring.
15306208	Drug-drug interactions of Z-338, a novel gastroprokinetic agent, with terfenadine, comparison with cisapride, and involvement of UGT1A9 and 1A8 in the human metabolism of Z-338. In the present study, the inhibitory properties of N-[2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl]-2-[(2-hydroxy-4,5-dimethoxybenzoyl)amino]-1,3-thiazole-4-carboxamide monohydrochloride trihydrate (Z-338), a novel gastroprokinetic agent, were investigated and compared with those of cisapride to establish its potential for drug-drug interactions. There was no notable inhibition of terfenadine metabolism or of any of the isoforms of cytochrome P450 (CYP1A1/2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4) by Z-338 in in vitro studies using human liver microsomes. Z-338 was mainly metabolized to its glucuronide by UGT1A9 (UDP glucoronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A9) and UGT1A8, and did not show marked inhibition of P-glycoprotein activity. On the other hand, cisapride strongly inhibited CYP3A4 and markedly inhibited CYP2C9. Furthermore, we used the whole-cell patch-clamp technique to investigate the effects of Z-338 and cisapride on potassium currents in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells transfected with the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG). Z-338 had no significant effect on hERG-related current at the relatively high concentration of 10 microM. In contrast, the inhibition by Z-338 was very small compared with that of cisapride at 10 nM, which was a thousand-fold lower concentration. In the prediction method for the drug interaction between terfenadine and cisapride based on the K(i) and PK parameters, we suggest the possibility that terfenadine mainly affect the QT interval, since its plasma concentration would be markedly increased, but cisapride may not be changed. Thus, in contrast with cisapride, Z-338 did not inhibit CYP and the hERG channel, and is predominantly metabolized by glucuronide conjugation, Z-338 is considered unlikely to cause significant drug-drug interactions when coadministered with CYP substrates at clinically effective doses.
20227354	Determination of methyl-, 2-hydroxyethyl- and 2-cyanoethylmercapturic acids as biomarkers of exposure to alkylating agents in cigarette smoke. Alkylating agents occur in the environment and are formed endogenously. Tobacco smoke contains a variety of alkylating agents or precursors including, among others, N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), acrylonitrile and ethylene oxide. We developed and validated a method for the simultaneous determination of methylmercapturic acid (MMA, biomarker for methylating agents such as NDMA and NNK), 2-hydroxyethylmercapturic acid (HEMA, biomarker for ethylene oxide) and 2-cyanoethylmercapturic acid (CEMA, biomarker for acrylonitrile) in human urine using deuterated internal standards of each compound. The method involves liquid/liquid extraction of the urine sample, solid phase extraction on anion exchange cartridges, derivatization with pentafluorobenzyl bromide (PFBBr), liquid/liquid extraction of the reaction mixture and LC-MS/MS analysis with positive electrospray ionization. The method was linear in the ranges of 5.00-600, 1.00-50.0 and 1.50-900 ng/ml for MMA, HEMA and CEMA, respectively. The method was applied to two clinical studies in adult smokers of conventional cigarettes who either continued smoking conventional cigarettes, were switched to test cigarettes consisting of either an electrically heated cigarette smoking system (EHCSS) or having a highly activated carbon granule filter that were shown to have reduced exposure to specific smoke constituents, or stopped smoking. Urinary excretion of MMA was found to be unaffected by switching to the test cigarettes or stop smoking. Urinary HEMA excretion decreased by 46 to 54% after switching to test cigarettes and by approximately 74% when stopping smoking. Urinary CEMA excretion decreased by 74-77% when switching to test cigarettes and by approximately 90% when stopping smoking. This validated method for urinary alkylmercapturic acids is suitable to distinguish differences in exposure not only between smokers and nonsmokers but also between smoking of conventional and the two test cigarettes investigated in this study.
18720282	Strategies to prevent N-acetyltransferase-mediated metabolism in a series of piperazine-containing pyrazalopyrimidine compounds. 1. (1-Methyl-5-piperazine-1-yl-3-propyl-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidin-7-yl)-(5-methyl-pyridin-2-yl)-amine (UK-469,413) was identified as a lead compound in a new medicinal chemistry programme. UK-469,413 had good physicochemical properties and was slowly metabolized by cytochromes P450 in rat and human liver microsomes. 2. In the rat in vivo the compound was rapidly cleared. Subsequent studies showed that UK-469,413 was rapidly acetylated in rat liver cytosol to an N-acetylpiperazine metabolite that was the major circulating metabolite in rat plasma in vivo. 3. Analogues of UK-469,413 containing the unsubstituted piperazine moiety were rapidly acetylated in rat liver cytosol and had high plasma clearance in the rat in vivo. These compounds were also acetylated in human liver cytosol and the N-acetyl metabolite was a major metabolite formed in incubations with cryopreserved human hepatocytes. 4. Using specific inhibitors, correlation analysis and expressed human N-acetyltransferase (NAT) enzymes the compounds were shown to be substrates of the polymorphically expressed NAT-2 isozyme. 5. Further experiments showed that it was possible to make small structural changes to the piperazine group that retained potency but prevented metabolism by NAT.
17562804	Pharmacokinetics, safety, and hydrolysis of oral pyrroloquinazolinediamines administered in single and multiple doses in rats. Pyrroloquinazolinediamine (PQD) derivatives such as tetra-acetamide PQD (PQD-A4) and bis-ethylcarbamyl PQD (PQD-BE) were much safer (with therapeutic indices of 80 and 32, respectively) than their parent compound, PQD (therapeutic index, 10). Further evaluation of PQD-A4 and PQD-BE in single and multiple pharmacokinetic (PK) studies as well as corresponding toxicity studies was conducted with rats. PQD-A4 could be converted to two intermediate metabolites (monoacetamide PQD and bisacetamide PQD) first and then to the final metabolite, PQD, while PQD-BE was directly hydrolyzed to PQD without precursor and intermediate metabolites. Maximum tolerant doses showed that PQD-A4 and PQD-BE have only 1/12 and 1/6, respectively, of the toxicity of PQD after a single oral dose. Compared to the area under the concentration-time curve for PQD alone (2,965 ng.h/ml), values measured in animals treated with PQD-A4 and PQD-BE were one-third (1,047 ng.h/ml) and one-half (1,381 ng.h/ml) as high, respectively, after an equimolar dosage, suggesting that PQD was the only agent to induce the toxicity. Similar results were also shown in multiple treatments; PQD-A4 and PQD-BE generated two-fifths and three-fifths, respectively, of PQD concentrations, with 8.8-fold and 3.8-fold safety margins, respectively, over the parent drug. PK data indicated that the bioavailability of oral PQD-A4 was greatly limited at high dose levels, that PQD-A4 was slowly converted to PQD via a sequential three-step process of conversion, and that PQD-A4 was significantly less toxic than the one-step hydrolysis drug, PQD-BE. It was concluded that the slow and smaller release of PQD was the main reason for the reduction in toxicity and that the active intermediate metabolites can still maintain antimalarial potency. Therefore, the candidate with multiple-step hydrolysis of PQD could be developed as a safer potential agent for malaria treatment.
12920170	Metabolism, excretion, and pharmacokinetics of duloxetine in healthy human subjects. Duloxetine is a potent and balanced dual inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake being investigated for the treatment of depression and urinary incontinence. The disposition of duloxetine was studied in four healthy human subjects after a single 20.2-mg (100.6 microCi) oral dose of [14C]duloxetine in an enteric-coated tablet. The mean total recovery of radioactivity (+/- S.E.M.) after 312 h was 90.5% (+/-0.4%) with 72.0% (+/-1.1%) excreted in the urine. Duloxetine was extensively metabolized to numerous metabolites primarily excreted into the urine in the conjugated form. The major biotransformation pathways for duloxetine involved oxidation of the naphthyl ring at either the 4-, 5-, or 6-positions followed by further oxidation, methylation, and/or conjugation. The major metabolites found in plasma were glucuronide conjugates of the following: 4-hydroxy duloxetine (M6), 6-hydroxy-5-methoxy duloxetine (M10), 4, 6-dihydroxy duloxetine (M9), and a sulfate conjugate of 5-hydroxy-6-methoxy duloxetine (M7). The major metabolites found in plasma were also found in the urine, but the urine contained many additional metabolites. In addition to duloxetine, 4-hydroxy duloxetine (M14) and an unidentified polar metabolite were observed in feces. Following [14C]duloxetine administration, Cmax was reached at a median of 6 h for both duloxetine and total radioactivity. Duloxetine accounted for less than 3% of the circulating radioactivity based on mean area under the curve values. The elimination half-life of total radioactivity (120 h) was substantially longer than that of duloxetine (10.3 h).
8714596	Determination of benzidine, N-acetylbenzidine, and N,N'-diacetylbenzidine in human urine by capillary gas chromatography/negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry. We report an isotope dilution mass spectrometry method using capillary gas chromatography/negative ion chemical ionization to quantitate urine concentrations of benzidine (BZ) and of its acetylated metabolites N-acetylbenzidine (ABZ) and N,N'-diacetylbenzidine (DABZ). Urine samples were purified by solid-phase extraction columns, reduced with LiAlH4/THF, and derivatized with pentafluoropropionic anhydride. The derivatives were measured by selected ion monitoring relative to deuterium-labeled internal standards. A detection limit as low as 0.5, 0.8, and 1.5 ppt for BZ, ABZ, and DABZ, respectively, can easily be achieved. Urinary concentrations of ABZ substantially exceed those of either BZ or of DABZ in workers exposed to BZ or BZ-based dyes. This method has been successfully used to measure BZ, ABZ, and DABZ in 1.0-ml urine samples collected from workers involved in manufacturing BZ and BZ-based dyes. The method should be applicable to the measurement of other aromatic amines and their acetylated metabolites.
15103438	Comparison of the pharmacokinetics of fosfluconazole and fluconazole after single intravenous administration of fosfluconazole in healthy Japanese and Caucasian volunteers. To investigate the bioavailability of fluconazole (FLCZ) from fosfluconazole (phosphate pro-drug of FLCZ) and to compare the pharmacokinetics of fosfluconazole and FLCZ in Japanese and Caucasian subjects. In a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, single-dose, two-period, crossover study, 12 Japanese and 12 Caucasian healthy subjects received a bolus intravenous injection of 1000 mg fosfluconazole or an intravenous infusion of 800 mg FLCZ in random order. Concentrations of fosfluconazole and FLCZ were determined in plasma and urine samples taken up to 144 h and 48 h post-dose, respectively. The bioavailability of FLCZ after administration of fosfluconazole was 95.2% (95% confidence interval: 89.0, 102.0) in Japanese subjects and 100.6% (94.0, 107.7) in Caucasian subjects. The ratio of bioavailabilities (Japanese/Caucasian) was 94.7% (86.0, 104.3). There were no statistically significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of fosfluconazole (except for AUC(inf)) and FLCZ between Japanese and Caucasian subjects. Although mean AUC(inf) of fosfluconazole was 25.6% (5.6, 49.2) greater in Japanese subjects, the lack of a statistically significant difference in weight-adjusted CL of fosfluconazole demonstrates that the difference in AUC(inf) was due to a difference in body weight. The adverse-event profile was similar in Japanese and Caucasian subjects after both fosfluconazole and FLCZ dosing, and both treatments were well tolerated in each group. The pharmacokinetics of fosfluconazole and FLCZ were similar in Japanese and Caucasian subjects. Fosfluconazole is almost completely converted to FLCZ and similar systemic exposure to FLCZ is achieved after single doses of fosfluconazole in both Japanese and Caucasian subjects.
2079512	Determination of ximoprofen and its metabolites in human urine by high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet absorbance detection. A simple, sensitive and selective method for the determination of ximoprofen and its keto and hydroxy metabolites in human urine has been developed using high-performance liquid chromatography in the reversed-phase mode. The limit of reliable determination of ximoprofen and each of its metabolites in urine is about 1 microgram/ml (4 nmol/ml). The method has been applied to urine samples obtained from human volunteers after administration of single intravenous doses of 30 mg of ximoprofen and about 70% dose was accounted for in terms of these compounds and their glucuronic acid conjugates.
15887009	The effect of mild and moderate hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of valdecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor. This study evaluated the effects of varying degrees of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics and safety of valdecoxib following single and multiple dosing. This was an open-label, randomised, parallel group study in 12 subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) and in 13 with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) matched for age, weight, sex, and smoking status; there were two control groups of 12 healthy volunteers, one for each study group. All subjects received a single dose of valdecoxib 20 mg on day 1 and valdecoxib 20 mg twice daily on days 4-7, followed by a single morning dose on day 8. Plasma concentrations of free (unbound) and total valdecoxib and its active hydroxylated metabolite (SC-66905) were measured following single and multiple dosing (day 1 and day 8). Additionally, all subjects received a single intravenous dose of lidocaine 60 mg during the pretreatment period to determine plasma concentrations of monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) as a marker of hepatic CYP3A4 activity. The mean apparent oral clearance of free valdecoxib in plasma at steady state decreased by 22-25% in those with mild to moderate impairment (corresponding to a 28-33% increase in the AUC of free valdecoxib and a 19-23% decrease in the AUC of total SC-66905). The mean free fraction of valdecoxib in plasma increased by 9-38%, resulting in a mean decrease in apparent oral clearance of total valdecoxib in plasma of 0-15% (corresponding to a 0-17% increase in the AUC of total valdecoxib). Individual AUCs for free valdecoxib and total SC-66905 did not correlate well with AUCs for MEGX, indicating that decreases in intrinsic clearance of valdecoxib in those with hepatic impairment could not solely be explained by decreased CYP3A4 expression in hepatic impairment. In our small study sample, mild and moderate hepatic impairment appeared to have only a modest effect on valdecoxib and SC-66905 pharmacokinetics. The adjustment of valdecoxib dose or dosing regimen does not appear mandatory in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, although caution is necessary during treatment of these patients with valdecoxib.
22369095	Inhibition of CYP2D6-mediated tramadol O-demethylation in methadone but not buprenorphine maintenance patients. Management of pain in opioid dependent individuals is problematic due to numerous issues including cross-tolerance to opioids. Hence there is a need to find alternative analgesics to classical opioids and tramadol is potentially one such alternative. Methadone inhibits CYP2D6 in vivo and in vitro. We aimed to investigate the effect of methadone on the pathways of tramadol metabolism: O-demethylation (CYP2D6) to the opioid-active metabolite M1 and N-demethylation (CYP3A4) to M2 in subjects maintained on methadone or buprenorphine as a control. Compared with subjects on buprenorphine, methadone reduced the clearance of tramadol to active O-desmethyl-tramadol (M1) but had no effect on N-desmethyltramadol (M2) formation. Similar to other analgesics whose active metabolites are formed by CYP2D6 such as codeine, reduced formation of O-desmethyltramadol (M1) is likely to result in reduced analgesia for subjects maintained on methadone. Hence alternative analgesics whose metabolism is independent of CYP2D6 should be utilized in this patient population. To compare the O- (CYP2D6 mediated) and N- (CYP3A4 mediated) demethylation metabolism of tramadol between methadone and buprenorphine maintained CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer subjects. METHODS Nine methadone and seven buprenorphine maintained subjects received a single 100 mg dose of tramadol hydrochloride. Blood was collected at 4 h and assayed for tramadol, methadone, buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine (where appropriate) and all urine over 4 h was assayed for tramadol and its M1 and M2 metabolites. The urinary metabolic ratio [median (range)] for O-demethylation (M1) was significantly lower (P= 0.0002, probability score 1.0) in the subjects taking methadone [0.071 (0.012-0.103)] compared with those taking buprenorphine [0.192 (0.108-0.392)], but there was no significant difference (P= 0.21, probability score 0.69) in N-demethylation (M2). The percentage of dose [median (range)] recovered as M1 was significantly lower in subjects taking methadone compared with buprenorphine (0.069 (0.044-0.093) and 0.126 (0.069-0.187), respectively, P= 0.04, probability score 0.19), M2 was significantly higher in subjects taking methadone compared with buprenorphine (0.048 (0.033-0.085) and 0.033 (0.014-0.049), respectively, P= 0.04, probability score 0.81). Tramadol was similar (0.901 (0.635-1.30) and 0.685 (0.347-1.04), respectively, P= 0.35, probability score 0.65). Methadone inhibited the CYP2D6-mediated metabolism of tramadol to M1. Hence, as the degree of opioid analgesia is largely dependent on M1 formation, methadone maintenance patients may not receive adequate analgesia from oral tramadol.
15019042	Identification of BVT.2938 metabolites by LC/MS and LC/MS/MS after in vitro incubations with liver microsomes and hepatocytes. The metabolism of the 5HT2c agonist BVT.2938, 1-(3-[2-[(2-ethoxy-3-pyridinyl)oxy]ethoxy]-2-pyrazinyl)-2(R)-methylpiperazine, was studied in vitro by incubation with rat, monkey and human liver microsomes as well as cryopreserved hepatocytes, followed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and LC/MS/MS analysis on a quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometer for structural elucidation. Deuterium exchange on column was used to differentiate between hydroxylation and N-oxidation. Liver microsomes were incubated in two different buffer systems with optimum conditions for cytochrome P450 activity or UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity. The major phase I metabolites of BVT.2938 originated from O-deethylation of the pyridine ring, O-dealkylation of the ethylene bridge, pyrazine ring hydroxylation, hydroxylation of pyridine ring and piperazine ring N-hydroxylation. When a hydrogen carbonate buffer system was supplemented with UDPGA, the piperazine carbamoyl-glucuronide from the parent compound was identified together with several glucuronides of the phase I metabolites. The metabolite pattern in hepatocytes was similar to microsomes except that the sulphate at the N-position of the piperazine ring of BVT.2938 was identified, while the carbamoyl-glucuronide was missing. Excellent correlation was obtained between radioactivity detection and the chemiluminescent nitrogen detector when the nitrogen content of the analytes was taken into account.
16010870	Metabolism of the new alpha-1A-adrenergic receptor antagonist, phthalimide-phenylpiperazine analog (RWJ-69442), in rat, dog and human hepatic S9 fractions, and in rats. The in vitro and in vivo metabolism of RWJ-69442, an alpha-1A-adrenergic receptor antagonist, was investigated after incubation with rat, dog, and human hepatic S9 fractions in the presence of NADPH-generating system, and a single oral/iv dose administration to rats (oral: 100 mg/kg; iv: 10 mg/kg). Unchanged RWJ-69442 (> or =30% of the sample in vitro; < or =47% of the sample in vivo) plus 14 metabolites were profiled, quantified and tentatively identified on the basis of API-MS and MS/MS data. The metabolic pathways for RWJ-69442 are proposed via the 4 steps: 1. phenyl/piperazinylhydroxylation, 2. N/O-dealkylation, 3. N-dephenylation, and 4. dehydration. Pathway 1 formed OH-phenyl-RWJ-69442 (M1, 4-32% in vitro & in vivo), and diOH-RWJ-69442 (M4, <1-4% in vitro & in vivo). Pathway 2 generated O-desisopropyl-RWJ-69442 (M2, <1-21% in vitro & in vivo), N-desmethyl-RWJ-69442 (M3, 2-3% in vitro & in vivo), N-desmethyl-M2 (M6, 1-8% in vitro & in vivo), and N-dealkylated RWJ-69442 (M9, < or =1-17% in vitro & in vivo), and in conjunction with pathway 1 produced 6 minor to major oxidized metabolites, OH-M2 (M5, 1-2% in vitro), OH-M3 (M11, 4-6% in vivo), OH-M9 (M10, <1-34% in vitro & in vivo), O-desisopropyl-M9 (M12, 3-21% in vivo), O-desisopropyl-M10 (M13,2-12% in vivo), and dehydro-M13 (M14, 25% in vivo). Pathways 3 and 4 formed 2 minor metabolites, N-desphenyl-RWJ-69442 (M7, <1-12% in vitro & in vivo) and dehydrated-RWJ-69442 (M8, <1-2% in vitro), respectively. RWJ-69442 is extensively metabolized in vitro in the rat and human (except dog), and in vivo in the rat.
19426681	Identification of metabolites of meisoindigo in rat, pig and human liver microsomes by UFLC-MS/MS. 3-(1,2-Dihydro-2-oxo-3H-indol-3-ylidene)-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2H-indol-2-one, abbreviated as meisoindigo, has been a routine therapeutic agent in the clinical treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia in China since the 1980s. To gain an understanding of the interspecies differences in the metabolism of meisoindigo, the relevant metabolism studies were carried out for the first time in rat, pig and human liver microsomes of different genders by ultra fast liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (UFLC-MS/MS). The qualitative metabolite identification was accomplished by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in combination with Enhanced Product Ion (EPI). The semi-quantitative metabolic stability and metabolite formation were simultaneously measured by MRM. The in vitro metabolic pathways of meisoindigo in three species were proposed as 3,3' double bond reduction, followed by N-demethylation, and reduction followed by phenyl mono-oxidation. Two novel metabolic pathways involving direct phenyl mono-oxidation without reduction in the three species, and direct N-demethylation without reduction in only pig and human, were also proposed. It may be noted that the two metabolites formed after reduction followed by phenyl mono-oxidation at positions 4, 5, 6 or 7, as well as one metabolite formed from direct phenyl mono-oxidation at either of the two phenyl rings without reduction were found to be uniquely present in human. The in vitro t(1/2) and in vitro CL(int) values of meisoindigo were calculated. Statistical analysis showed there were no significant differences in the metabolic stability profiles of meisoindigo among three species, and gender effect on the metabolic stability of meisoindigo was negligible. Formation profiles of the most significant reductive metabolites were obtained in the three species.
19074972	Novel metabolites of amodiaquine formed by CYP1A1 and CYP1B1: structure elucidation using electrochemistry, mass spectrometry, and NMR. An aldehyde metabolite of amodiaquine and desethylamodiaquine has been identified. The aldehyde was the major metabolite formed in incubations with two recombinantly expressed human cytochromes P450 (rP450s), namely, CYP1A1 and CYP1B1. The aldehyde metabolite was also formed, to a lesser extent, in both human and rat liver microsomes. When comparing results from incubations with liver microsomes from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats (inducing CYP1A1 and CYP1B1) with those from noninduced rats, a 6-fold increase of the aldehyde metabolite was observed in the rat liver microsomes after 3-methylcholanthrene treatment. The metabolic oxidation was mimicked by the electrochemical system, and the electrochemical oxidation product was matched with the metabolite from the in vitro incubations. The electrochemical generation of the aldehyde metabolite was repeated on a preparative scale, and the proposed structure was confirmed by NMR. Trapping of the aldehyde metabolite was done with methoxyl amine. Trapping experiments with N-acetyl cysteine revealed that the aldehyde was further oxidized to an aldehyde quinoneimine species, both in the rP450 incubations and in the electrochemical system. Three additional new metabolites of amodiaquine and desethylamodiaquine were formed via rCYP1A1 and rCYP1B1. Trace amounts of these metabolites were also observed in incubations with liver microsomes from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats. Tentative structures of the metabolites and adducts were assigned based on liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry in combination with accurate mass measurements.
15832300	Analysis of oxycodol and noroxycodol stereoisomers in biological samples by capillary electrophoresis. A capillary electrophoresis (CE) method for the separation of the diastereoisomers of 6-oxycodol (6OCOL) and nor-6-oxycodol (N6OCOL), the 6-keto-reduced metabolites of oxycodone (OCOD) and noroxycodone (NOCOD), respectively, is reported and employed to assess the stereoselectivity of these metabolic steps in vivo, in vitro, and in chemical synthesis. CE in an untreated fused-silica capillary with acidic buffers containing 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin, randomly sulfated beta-cyclodextrin, or single isomer heptakis(2,3-diacetyl-6-sulfato)-beta-cyclodextrin (HDAS-beta-CD) is shown to permit the simultaneous separation of the stereoisomers of 6OCOL and N6OCOL. A 100 mM phosphate buffer of pH 2.0 containing 2.05% w/v HDAS-beta-CD provides a medium for rapid analysis and unambiguous identification of these stereoisomers in solid-phase extracts of (i) urines stemming from patients under pharmacotherapy with OCOD, (ii) incubations of OCOD and NOCOD with human liver cytosol and the human liver S9 fraction, and (iii) after chemical synthesis from OCOD and NOCOD using NaBH(4). In all cases, alpha-N6OCOL is shown to be the predominant stereoisomer of N6OCOL. For 6OCOL, the same is true for in vitro formation and for chemical synthesis. In urine, however, beta-6OCOL is observed to be excreted in a higher amount than alpha-6OCOL. For the urinary alpha-/beta-isomer ratio of 6OCOL and N6OCOL, there are no differences between the data obtained for nonhydrolyzed and enzymatically hydrolyzed urines. The data document the stereoselectivity of the 6-keto-reduction of OCOD and NOCOD in man.
3765657	The metabolism of 14C-oxcarbazepine in man. The disposition of the new anti-epileptic agent oxcarbazepine (10,11-dihydro-10-oxo-5H-dibenz[b,f]azepine-5-carboxamide) has been studied in two healthy volunteers following an oral 400 mg dose of 14C-labelled drug. The dose was excreted almost completely in the urine (94.6 and 97.1%) within six days. Faecal excretion amounted to 4.3 and 1.9% of the dose in the two subjects. In the 0-6 days urine samples the biotransformation products have been isolated and identified. 10,11-Dihydro-10-hydroxycarbamazepine (GP 47,779) and its two diastereoisomeric O-glucuronides were found as main metabolites. Taken together, they accounted for 79% of urinary 14C. Unchanged oxcarbazepine, and its sulphate and glucuronide conjugates were isolated in smaller amounts only (13%). Other minor metabolites were the trans- and cis-isomers of 10,11-dihydro-10,11-dihydroxy-carbamazepine (approximately 4%), and a phenolic derivative of GP 47,779 (less than 1%). The biotransformation of oxcarbazepine proceeds mainly by reduction to GP 47,779, and subsequent conjugation with glucuronic acid. Reduction is stereospecific, favouring the S-configuration of GP 47,779. Direct conjugation of oxcarbazepine, in the enol form, is a minor pathway. Oxidative reactions are unimportant.
15100167	Cytochrome P450 2C8 (CYP2C8)-mediated hydroxylation of an endothelin ETA receptor antagonist in human liver microsomes. In vitro studies were performed to identify the human cytochrome P450 enzyme(s) involved in the hydroxylation (isopropyl moiety) of a previously reported endothelin ET(A) receptor antagonist, compound A [(+)-(5S,6R,7R)-2-isopropylamino-7-(4-methoxy-2-[(2R)-3-methoxy-2-methylpropyl])-5-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)cyclopenteno(1,2-b) pyridine 6-carboxylic acid]. Several lines of evidence indicated that the reaction was mainly catalyzed by CYP2C8. Of the 10 recombinant cytochrome P450 isoforms tested, only CYP2C8 exhibited hydroxylase activity. In agreement, inhibitory antibodies selective for CYP2C8 attenuated (>95%) the hydroxylase activity in human liver microsomes, whereas antibodies and chemical inhibitors selective for other cytochrome P450 isoforms had a minor or no effect on the reaction. In addition, the formation of the hydroxy metabolite correlated well with CYP2C8-selective paclitaxel 6alpha-hydroxylation (r(2) approximately 0.92; p < 0.0001) and amodiaquine N-de-ethylation (r(2) approximately 0.91; p < 0.0001) in a bank of human liver microsomes (n = 15 organ donors). Finally, compound A hydroxylase activity conformed to Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and the K(m) (Michaelis constant) in human liver microsomes was similar to that of CYP2C8 ( approximately 10 microM). It is concluded that the hydroxylation of compound A is mainly catalyzed by CYP2C8, and thus the reaction can possibly serve as an alternative marker assay for CYP2C8 in human liver microsomes.
7482685	Inhibition of trazodone metabolism by thioridazine in humans. To clarify the involvement of cytochrome P4502D6 (CYP2D6) in the metabolism of trazodone, the effects of coadministration of thioridazine, which is an inhibitor of this isozyme, on plasma concentrations of trazodone and its active metabolite m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP) were studied. The subjects were 11 depressed patients receiving trazodone at bedtime for 1-18 weeks. The dose was 150 mg in 10 patients and 300 mg in one. Thioridazine 40 mg/day was coadministered for 1 week, and blood samplings were performed before and after the coadministration. Thioridazine significantly (p < 0.001) increased plasma concentrations of both trazodone (713 +/- 252 vs. 969 +/- 370 ng/ml) and m-CPP (61 +/- 22 vs. 94 +/- 34 ng/ml). The present study thus suggests that CYP2D6 is involved in the metabolism of trazodone.
18773877	Intracellular metabolism of the new antiviral compound 1-(S)-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]-5-azacytosine. 1-(S)-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]-5-azacytosine [HPMP-5-azaC], the 5-azacytosine analogue of cidofovir (HPMPC), represents a new acyclic nucleoside phosphonate with pronounced activity against DNA viruses, and a selectivity index superior to that of cidofovir. Here we investigated the intracellular metabolic pathway of [6-(3)H]-HPMP-5-azaC. By comparing the metabolism in mouse lymphosarcoma S49-wild type (S49-WT) and mutant cells deficient for dCMP deaminase, we identified the mono- and diphosphate metabolites generated from HPMP-5-azaC and its deaminated product HPMP-5-azaU. In human lung carcinoma A549 cells, the relative formation of the deaminated metabolites was only 6%, implying that deamination plays a minor role in the overall metabolism of HPMP-5-azaC. The diphosphorylated metabolite of HPMP-5-azaC accounted for 60% of the total radioactivity, and reached intracellular levels which were 60-fold higher in absolute value than the corresponding diphosphate levels obtained with cidofovir. Consequently to its increased activation, HPMP-5-azaC showed about 45-fold higher incorporation into cellular DNA than cidofovir. Herpes-, pox- or adenovirus infection had no marked influence on the metabolism of HPMP-5-azaC. The HPMP-5-azaC-diphosphate metabolite was shown to have long intracellular stability (half-life: 63h), suggesting that infrequent administration of HPMP-5-azaC should be possible. HPMP-5-azaC represents a new acyclic nucleoside phosphonate compound with promising anti-DNA virus activity and a favorable metabolic profile that is characterized by low sensitivity to catabolic deamination and a high rate of phosphorylation and DNA incorporation.
20008038	Identification of a novel N-carbamoyl glucuronide: in vitro, in vivo, and mechanistic studies. 1-[4-Aminomethyl-4-(3-chlorophenyl)-cyclohexyl]-tetrahydro-pyrimidin- 2-one, 1, was developed as an inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 enzyme. Biotransformation studies with 1 revealed the presence of an N-carbamoyl glucuronide metabolite (M1) in rat bile and urine. N-Carbamoyl glucuronides are rarely observed, and little is understood regarding the mechanism of N-carbamoyl glucuronidation. The objectives of the current investigation were to elucidate the structure of the novel N-carbamoyl glucuronide, to investigate the mechanism of N-carbamoyl glucuronide formation in vitro using stable labeled CO(2), UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) reaction phenotyping, and to assess whether M1 was formed to the same extent in vitro across species-mouse, rat, hamster, dog, monkey, and human. Structure elucidation was performed on a mass spectrometer with accurate mass measurement and MS(n) capabilities. (13)C-labeled carbon dioxide was used for identification of the mechanism of N-carbamoyl glucuronidation. Mechanistic studies with (13)C-labeled CO(2) in rat liver microsomes revealed that CO(2) from the bicarbonate buffer (in equilibrium with exogenous CO(2)) may be responsible for the formation of M1. M1 was formed in vitro in liver microsomes from multiple species, mainly rat and hamster, followed by similar formation in dog, monkey, mouse, and human. M1 could be detected in UGT1A1, UGT1A3, and UGT2B7 Supersomes in a CO(2)-rich environment. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that formation of M1 was observed in microsomal incubations across various species and strongly suggests incorporation of CO(2) from the bicarbonate buffer, in equilibrium with exogenous CO(2), into the carbamoyl moiety of the formed N-carbamoyl glucuronide.
4038635	Pharmacokinetics of aztreonam in patients with chronic renal failure. The elimination kinetics of aztreonam (SQ 26,776), a new, completely synthetic, monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic, were studied after the administration of a single 1g intravenous dose. Five healthy volunteers and 20 patients with various degrees of renal insufficiency were enrolled in this study. Concentrations of aztreonam in serum and urine were determined by both microbiological and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) assays. The pharmacokinetic parameters for aztreonam were calculated on the basis of a 2-compartment open model. Serum concentrations of aztreonam at 10 minutes after administration were approximately 100 micrograms/ml in all subjects, regardless of renal function (HPLC assay). The mean serum half-life during the alpha-phase showed no important variation with renal function. The mean serum half-life during the beta-phase was 1.8 hours in normal subjects and 8.4 hours in haemodialysis patients (HPLC assay). There was a linear correlation between the serum clearance of aztreonam and creatinine clearance. The mean cumulative urinary recovery of aztreonam in 48 hours was 60 to 70% of the administered dose in normal subjects but this was reduced in the presence of renal insufficiency. SQ 26,992, the microbiologically inactive metabolite of aztreonam resulting from hydrolytic opening of the beta-lactam ring, was undetectable in the serum of normal subjects but was found in low levels in uraemic patients. Half of a 1g intravenous dose of aztreonam was eliminated during 4 hours of haemodialysis. Guidelines for administration of aztreonam in the presence of renal failure are given.
17387045	Development and validation of bioanalytical methods for Imidafenacin (KRP-197/ONO-8025) and its metabolites in human plasma by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Imidafenacin (KRP-197/ONO-8025, IM), 4-(2-methyl-1H-imidazol-1-yl)-2,2-diphenylbutanamide, is a new antimuscarinic agent currently under application for the indication of treatment of overactive bladder in Japan. We developed and validated the sensitive and selective bioanalytical methods for the extremely low levels of IM and its metabolite, M-2 (Method 1), M-4 (Method 2) and M-9 (Method 3) in human plasma using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In each method, plasma sample was extracted by solid phase extraction, separated on a semi-micro high performance liquid chromatography column and detected by tandem mass spectrometer with an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization or ionspray interface. Selected reaction monitoring mode was used for quantification. Each method was found to have acceptable accuracy, precision, stability, selectivity and linearity over the concentration range of 10-500 pg/mL for IM and M-2, 10-1000 pg/mL for M-4 and 50-5000 pg/mL for M-9. Using these analytical methods, concentration profiles of IM and its metabolites in human plasma were successfully determined even in the low pg/mL levels after oral administration of IM at the therapeutic dosage of 0.1 mg.
19302911	Pharmacokinetics, bioequivalence, tolerability, and effects on platelet counts of two formulations of anagrelide in healthy volunteers and patients with thrombocythemia associated with chronic myeloproliferation. Anagrelide hydrochloride is an anti-thrombotic agent indicated for the treatment of essential thrombocythemia (ET). In various previously published clinical trials of 2 branded formulations of anagrelide in patients with ET at high risk for thrombohemorrhagic events, the rates of adverse events and discontinuation were strikingly divergent between brands. Because the formulations and manufacturers differed, the differences in tolerability, as well as platelet counts, might have been related to differences in pharmacokinetic properties between the 2 formulations. The present series of investigations (1) determined the pharmacokinetic profile of anagrelide and its metabolites; (2) compared the pharmacokinetic profiles of the test and reference formulations of anagrelide; (3) investigated the in vitro release of anagrelide as a marker of intragastric anagrelide release of the test and reference formulations; and (4) compared the platelet-reducing effects of the test and reference formulations in patients with thrombocythemia in 2 longitudinal studies over 4 weeks. A series of 4 in vivo studies and 1 in vitro study were conducted. In a pilot, prospective, singledose study in healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetic properties (C(max), T(max), and AUC(0-infinity)) of a test formulation of anagrelide were assessed using high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of plasma samples. Based on the results from that study, a single-dose, randomized, double-blind, 2-period crossover study in healthy volunteers was conducted to determine bioequivalence of 2 formulations of anagrelide 2 mg/d (taken as 4 capsules). In vitro dissolution properties of the test or reference formulation containing 0.5 mg anagrelide as the active ingredient were studied in an assay mimicking gastrointestinal release. To test for effects on platelet counts of switching from the reference formulation (previous treatment on stable dose for 3 months) to the test formulation, two 4-week longitudinal trials were conducted: one in patients with ET (in Germany), and one in patients with thrombocythemia associated with chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPDs) (in Austria). The pilot pharmacokinetic study of the test formulation in 16 volunteers (10 women, 6 men; mean [SD] age, 20.5 [1.5] years; weight, 69.0 [10.0 kg) suggested that anagrelide was metabolized to 3-hydroxyanagrelide (AUC(0-infinity) 50% compared with anagrelide) and the inactive metabolite 2-amino-5,6-dichloro-,4-dihydroquinazolone. The subsequent bioequivalence study in 24 volunteers (14 women, 10 men; mean [SD] age, 23 [4] years; white, 100%; weight, 67.5 [10.2] kg) found that the test formulation was associated with a significantly lower C(max) (point estimation [PE], 66%; 90% CI, 58%-76%; P < 0.001) and AUC(0-infinity) (PE, 77%; 90% CI, 68%-86%; P = 0.001). T(max) values for anagrelide and 3-hydroxyanagrelide were 1 hour longer with the test formulation compared with the reference formulation. The total number of adverse events with the reference formulation was 46; the test formulation, 29 (P = 0.05). In vitro, anagrelide from the reference formulation was immediately released (89.1% at 5 minutes), whereas there was a delayed release (93.6% at 30 minutes) from the test formulation (P < 0.05). In the last 2 studies, 2 cohorts of white patients (cohort 1, 15 patients with ET; 10 women, 5 men; mean [SD] age, 49.0 [10.7] years [range, 31-66 years]; weight, 73.2 [12.6] kg; cohort 2, 19 patients with thrombocythemia associated with CMPD; 12 women, 7 men; age, 62.6 [12.4] years [range, 38-80 years]; weight, 66.1 [13.3] kg) who had received treatment for > or =3 months with the reference formulation were switched to the same dose of the test formulation and maintained on this dose for 4 weeks. Platelet counts did not change significantly from baseline over 4 weeks and stayed within a predefined margin of 150 x 10(3) cells/microL. The pharmacokinetic properties, adverse event rates, and in vitro dissolution profile differed between the test and reference anagrelide formulations in these healthy volunteers. In patients with ET or thrombocythemia associated with CMPD, platelet counts did not differ significantly from baseline at 4 weeks when subjects were switched from the reference to the test anagrelide formulation.
21989950	Identification of the oxidative and conjugative enzymes involved in the biotransformation of brivanib. Brivanib alaninate, the L-alanine ester prodrug of brivanib, is currently being developed as an anticancer agent. In humans, brivanib alaninate is rapidly hydrolyzed to brivanib. Prominent biotransformation pathways of brivanib included oxidation and direct sulfate conjugation. A series of in vitro studies were conducted to identify the human esterases involved in the prodrug hydrolysis and to identify the primary human cytochrome P450 and sulfotransferase (SULT) enzymes involved in the metabolism of brivanib. Brivanib alaninate was efficiently converted to brivanib in the presence of either human carboxylesterase 1 or carboxylesterase 2. Because esterases are ubiquitous, it is likely that multiple esterases are involved in the hydrolysis. Oxidation of brivanib in human liver microsomes (HLM) primarily formed a hydroxylated metabolite (M7). Incubation of brivanib with human cDNA-expressed P450 enzymes and with HLM in the presence of selective chemical inhibitors and monoclonal P450 antibodies demonstrated that CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 were the major contributors for the formation of M7. Direct sulfation of brivanib was catalyzed by multiple SULT enzymes, including SULT1A1, SULT1B1, SULT2A1, SULT1A3, and SULT1E1. Because the primary in vitro oxidative metabolite (M7) was not detected in humans after oral doses of brivanib alaninate, further metabolism studies of M7 in HLM and human liver cytosol were performed. The data demonstrated that M7 was metabolized to the prominent metabolites observed in humans. Overall, multiple enzymes are involved in the metabolism of brivanib, suggesting a low potential for drug-drug interactions either through polymorphism or through inhibition of a particular drug-metabolizing enzyme.
15968885	Safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of oral S-3304, a novel matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, in single and multiple dose escalation studies in healthy volunteers. A novel sulfonamide derivative, S-3304, was discovered as a potent matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor. It is a more specific inhibitor to MMP-2 and MMP-9 (in vitro) than to MMP-1, and may therefore lack the musculoskeletal side effects seen with non-specific inhibitors. The aim of the present study was to investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of S-3304 when administered as single and multiple oral doses to healthy male volunteers. 48 male volunteers received single oral doses ranging from 10 - 800 mg S-3304 or placebo under fasting conditions. At the 200 mg dose level, effects of high-fat diets were studied in a crossover design. In the multiple dose design, 24 male subjects were administered 200 mg, 400 mg or 800 mg S-3304 or placebo b.i.d. after meals for 10 - 17 days. Studies were conducted in a randomized double-blind fashion. Safety assessment was conducted based on blood chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, electrocardiogram and physical examination. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for S-3304 and its metabolites. All subjects were enrolled in the studies after obtaining informed consent. Adverse events reported after single dose administration of S-3304 or placebo were all of mild severity. Adverse events reported in the multiple dose treatment with S-3304 or placebo were mostly of mild severity, except for two episodes of moderate headache and two episodes of moderate myalgia. Most commonly reported adverse events in the multiple treatments with S-3304 were headache and somnolence. No clinically significant changes were observed in the clinical laboratory tests, except for reversible elevation of alanine aminotransferase of one subject at 800 mg S-3304 b.i.d. In the single dose administration, Cmax and mean AUC0-infinity linearly increased up to 63,167 ng/ml and 311,960 ng x h/ml at the 800 mg dose level, respectively; tmax and t1/2 ranged from 2 - 3 hours and from 9.5 - 15.5 hours, respectively. High-fat diets reduced Cmax from 21,565 ng/ml to 14,095 ng/ml but did not alter AUC0-infinity. Hydroxylated metabolites were detected in plasma in concentrations less than 1% of S-3304. Less than 1% S-3304 was excreted in urine. The AUC of one dosing interval and Cmax did not change after multiple doses but t1/2 increased from 9.5 - 10.0 hours to 12.5 - 13.5 hours. The 6beta-hydroxycortisol/ cortisol ratio was not changed after multiple doses suggesting no effect on CYP3A4 activity. S-3304 demonstrated a good safety profile and good systemic exposure when administered orally up to 800 mg b.i.d. during 10 - 17 days. At the highest dose level of 800 mg b.i.d., it was free of rheumatoid arthritis-like symptoms.
20851877	Metabolism of sesamin by cytochrome P450 in human liver microsomes. Metabolism of sesamin by cytochrome P450 (P450) was examined using yeast expression system and human liver microsomes. Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells expressing each of human P450 isoforms (CYP1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C18, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4) were cultivated with sesamin, and monocatechol metabolite was observed in most of P450s. Kinetic analysis using the microsomal fractions of the recombinant S. cerevisiae cells revealed that CYP2C19 had the largest k(cat)/K(m) value. Based on the kinetic data and average contents of the P450 isoforms in the human liver, the putative contribution of P450s for sesamin metabolism was large in the order of CYP2C9, 1A2, 2C19, and 2D6. A good correlation was observed between sesamin catecholization activity and CYP2C9-specific activity in in vitro studies using 10 individual human liver microsomes, strongly suggesting that CYP2C9 is the most important P450 isoform for sesamin catecholization in human liver. Inhibition studies using each anti-P450 isoform-specific antibody confirmed that CYP2C9 was the most important, and the secondary most important P450 was CYP1A2. We also examined the inhibitory effect of sesamin for P450 isoform-specific activities and found a mechanism-based inhibition of CYP2C9 by sesamin. In contrast, no mechanism-based inhibition by sesamin was observed in CYP1A2-specific activity. Our findings strongly suggest that further studies are needed to reveal the interaction between sesamin and therapeutic drugs mainly metabolized by CYP2C9.
2736507	Enhanced demethylation and denitrosation of N-nitrosodimethylamine by human liver microsomes from alcoholics. The metabolism of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) was investigated in incubations with human liver microsomes from alcoholics and control patients who suffered from other diseases, but had a histological normal liver. All of the microsomal samples studied were able to metabolize NDMA at various concentrations to both formaldehyde and nitrite. Analysis of the liver microsomes from alcoholics revealed that both enzymatic activities--formaldehyde and nitrite formation--were enhanced several times as compared to the control patients. The results point to the fact that alcoholics metabolize NDMA at a higher rate probably due to the induction of one or more ethanol-inducible human liver cytochromes (cyt.) P450. The question if alcoholics therefore possess a higher risk for carcinogenic events is discussed.
14744942	Biotransformation of fucoxanthinol into amarouciaxanthin A in mice and HepG2 cells: formation and cytotoxicity of fucoxanthin metabolites. Fucoxanthin, a major carotenoid in edible brown algae, potentially inhibits the proliferation of human prostate cancer cells via apoptosis induction. However, it has been postulated that dietary fucoxanthin is hydrolyzed into fucoxanthinol in the gastrointestinal tract before absorption in the intestine. In the present study, we investigated the further biotransformation of orally administered fucoxanthin and estimated the cytotoxicity of fucoxanthin metabolites on PC-3 human prostate cancer cells. After the oral administration of fucoxanthin in mice, two metabolites, fucoxanthinol and an unknown metabolite, were found in the plasma and liver. The unknown metabolite was isolated from the incubation mixture of fucoxanthinol and mouse liver preparation (10,000 g supernatant of homogenates), and a series of instrumental analyses identified it as amarouciaxanthin A [(3S,5R,6'S)-3,5,6'-trihydroxy-6,7-didehydro-5,6,7',8'-tetrahydro-beta,epsilon-carotene-3',8'-dione]. The conversion of fucoxanthinol into amarouciaxanthin A was predominantly shown in liver microsomes. This dehydrogenation/isomerization of the 5,6-epoxy-3-hydroxy-5,6-dihydro-beta end group of fucoxanthinol into the 6'-hydroxy-3'-oxo-epsilon end group of amarouciaxanthin A required NAD(P)+ as a cofactor, and the optimal pH for the conversion was 9.5 to 10.0. Fucoxanthinol supplemented to culture medium via HepG2 cells was also converted into amarouciaxanthin A. The 50% inhibitory concentrations on the proliferation of PC-3 human prostate cancer cells were 3.0, 2.0, and 4.6 microM for fucoxanthin, fucoxanthinol, and amarouciaxanthin A, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the enzymatic dehydrogenation of a 3-hydroxyl end group of xanthophylls in mammals.
16356485	Metabolism and transporter-mediated drug-drug interactions of the endothelin-A receptor antagonist CI-1034. CI-1034, an endothelin-A receptor antagonist was being developed for pulmonary hypertension. Drug-drug interaction studies using human hepatic microsomes were conducted to assess CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibition potential; CYP3A4 induction potential was evaluated using primary human hepatocytes. CI-1034 moderately inhibited CYP2C9 (IC(50) 39.6 microM) and CYP3A4 activity (IC(50) 21.6 microM); CYP3A4 inhibition was metabolism-dependent. In human hepatocytes, no increase in CYP3A4 activity was observed in vitro, while mRNA was induced 15-fold, similar to rifampin, indicating that CI-1034 is both an inhibitor and inducer of CYP3A4. A 2-week clinical study was conducted to assess pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety. No significant changes were observed in [formula: see text] between days 1 and 14. However, reversible elevations of serum liver enzymes were observed with a 50mg BID dose and the program was terminated. To further understand the interactions of CI-1034 in the liver and possible mechanisms of the observed hepatotoxicity, we evaluated the effect of CI-1034 on bile acid transport and previously reported that CI-1034 inhibited biliary efflux of taurocholate by 60%, in vitro. This indicated that inhibition of major hepatic transporters could be involved in the observed hepatotoxicity. We next evaluated the in vitro inhibition potential of CI-1034 with the major hepatic transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1, MDR1, MRP2 and OCT. CI-1034 inhibited OATP1B1 (K(i) 2 microM), OATP1B3 (K(i) 1.8 microM) and OATP2B1 activity (K(i) 3.3 microM) but not OCT, MDR1 or MRP2 mediated transport. Our data indicates that CI-1034 is an inhibitor of major hepatic transporters and inhibition of bile efflux may have contributed to the observed clinical hepatotoxicity. We recommend that in vitro drug-drug interaction panels include inhibition and induction studies with transporters and drug metabolizing enzymes, to more completely assess potential in vivo interactions or toxicity.
12756210	Interaction of buprenorphine and its metabolite norbuprenorphine with cytochromes p450 in vitro. Buprenorphine is a thebaine derivative used in the treatment of heroin and other opiate addictions. In this study, the selective probe reactions for each of the major hepatic cytochromes P450 (P450s) were used to evaluate the effect of buprenorphine and its main metabolite norbuprenorphine on the activity of these P450s. The index reactions used were CYP1A2 (phenacetin O-deethylation), CYP2A6 (coumarin 7-hydroxylation), CYP2C9 (diclofenac 4'-hydroxylation), CYP2C19 (omeprazole 5-hydrxoylation), CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan O-demethylation), CYP2B6 (7-ethoxy-4-trifluoromethyl-coumarin 7-deethylation), CYP2E1 (chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylation), and CYP3A4 (omeprazole sulfoxidation). Buprenorphine exhibited potent, competitive inhibition of CYP2D6 (Ki 10 +/- 2 microM and 1.8 +/- 0.2 microM) and CYP3A4 (Ki 40 +/- 1.6 microM and 19 +/- 1.2 microM) in microsomes from human liver and cDNA-expressing lymphoblasts, respectively. Compared with buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine demonstrated a lower inhibitory potency with CYP2D6 (22.4% inhibition at 20 microM norbuprenorphine) and CYP3A4 (13.6% inhibition at 20 microM) in microsomes from human cDNA-expressing lymphoblast cells. Furthermore, buprenorphine was shown to be a substrate of CYP2D6 (Km = 600 microM; Vmax = 0.40 nmol/min/mg protein) and CYP3A4 (Km = 36 microM; Vmax = 0.19 nmol/min/mg protein). The present in vitro study suggests that buprenorphine and its major metabolite norbuprenorphine are inhibitors of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4; however, at therapeutic concentrations they are not predicted to cause potentially clinically important drug interactions with other drugs metabolized by major hepatic P450s.
1523859	Urinary metabolites of phenobarbitone, primidone, and their N-methyl and N-ethyl derivatives in humans. 1. Phenobarbitone (1) and three of its N-alkyl derivatives, and primidone (10) and four of its N-alkyl derivatives, were orally administered separately to two human volunteers. Total urine was collected for approximately 2 weeks following each dose, and the drugs and their metabolites were assayed by g.l.c.-mass spectrometry. 2. Recoveries in the phenobarbitone series increased from approximately 40% to approximately 50% as alkylation of (1) increased. There was a linear relationship between the extent of p-hydroxylation and the lipophilicity (log P) of the substrates. The increased total recovery was largely attributable to increased p-hydroxylation. 3. Urinary recoveries in the primidone series decreased from approximately 80% for (10) to approximately 30% for its diakyl derivatives, despite a slight increase in p-hydroxylation with increasing alkylation (and increasing lipophilicity). The decreased recovery was mainly the result of decreased urinary excretion of the drug.
12139053	Comparison of electrospray, atmospheric pressure chemical ionization, and atmospheric pressure photoionization in the identification of apomorphine, dobutamine, and entacapone phase II metabolites in biological samples. The applicability of different ionization techniques, electrospray ionization (ESI), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), and a novel atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI), were tested for the identification of the phase II metabolites of apomorphine, dobutamine, and entacapone in rat urine and in vitro incubation mixtures (rat hepatocytes and human liver microsomes). ESI proved to be the most suitable ionization method; it enabled detection of 22 conjugates, whereas APCI and APPI showed only 12 and 14 conjugates, respectively. Methyl conjugates were detected with all ionization methods. Glucuronide conjugates were ionized most efficiently with ESI. Only some of the glucuronides detected with ESI were detected with APCI and APPI. Sulfate conjugates were detected only with ESI. MS/MS experiments showed that the site of glucuronidation or sulfation could not be determined, since the primary cleavage was a loss of the conjugate group (glucuronic acid or SO3), and no site-characteristic product ions were formed. However, it may be possible to determine the site of methylation, since methylated products are more stable than glucuronides or sulfates. Furthermore, the loss of CH3 is not necessarily the primary cleavage, and site characteristic products may be formed. Identification and comparison of conjugates formed from the current model drugs were successfully analyzed in different biological specimens of common interest to biomedical research. A fairly good relation was obtained between the data from in vivo and in vitro models of drug metabolism.
18056254	CYP2D6-Mediated metabolism of a novel acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitor, pactimibe, and its unique plasma metabolite, R-125528. Pactimibe sulfate is a novel acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitor. We conducted metabolic studies of pactimibe and its plasma metabolite, R-125528. Pactimibe had multiple metabolic pathways including indolin oxidation to form R-125528, omega-1 oxidation, N-dealkylation, and glucuronidation. Among them, the indolin oxidation and the omega-1 oxidation were dominant and were mainly catalyzed by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, respectively. The intrinsic clearance (CL(int)) values for these pathways in human hepatic microsomes were 0.63 and 0.76 microl/min/mg-protein, respectively. On the other hand, the metabolic reaction for R-125528 was restricted. It was demonstrated that omega-1 oxidation was the only pathway that could eliminate R-125528 from the systemic circulation. To our surprise, only CYP2D6-expressing microsomes could catalyze the reaction, and omega-1 oxidation was strongly correlated with the CYP2D6 marker reaction, dextromethorphan O-demethylation (r(2) = 0.90), in human hepatic microsomes. Although R-125528 is an atypical substrate for CYP2D6 because of its acidity, the K(m) value was 1.8 microM for the reaction in human hepatic microsomes and the CL(int) value was as high as 75.0 microl/min/mg-protein. These results suggested that the systemic clearance of R-125528 was highly dependent on CYP2D6 activity and that several studies with CYP2D6 including drug-drug interaction and polymorphism sensitivity should be performed during development from the viewpoint of metabolite safety assessment. The finding that R-125528, an acidic compound devoid of basic nitrogen, was a good substrate for CYP2D6 raised a question about previously reported CYP2D6 models based on a critical electrostatic interaction with Asp(301) and/or Glu(216).
15516304	Two cases involving clomipramine intoxication. Clomipramine and its active metabolite norclomipramine were identified and quantitated in multiple tissues recovered from two postmortem cases using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. In both cases clomipramine toxicity was assessed primarily upon levels determined from brain samples. This communication supplements the database on clomipramine and norclomipramine by providing quantitative determinations of both parent drug and metabolite in multiple tissues. A literature search revealed a paucity of data on clomipramine and norclomipramine levels in general and a total absence of documented brain levels. In patients who have undergone long-term tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) therapy, blood and liver analysis alone may not be sufficient to establish toxicity. Such patients can sequester substantial amounts in liver, a concern because the TCAs are subject to significant postmortem redistribution. When conducting postmortem investigations, the inclusion of brain determination provides valuable information in assessing the magnitude of toxicity in cases involving clomipramine and its active metabolite norclomipramine.
22670830	Assessment of potential drug interactions by characterization of human drug metabolism pathways using non-invasive bile sampling. Characterization of the biliary disposition of GSK1325756, using a non-invasive bile sampling technique and spectrometric analyses, to inform the major routes of metabolic elimination and to enable an assessment of victim drug interaction risk. Sixteen healthy, elderly subjects underwent non-invasive bile capture using a peroral string device (Entero-Test(®)) prior to and following a single oral dose of GSK1325756 (100 mg). The device was swallowed by each subject and once the weighted string was judged to have reached the duodenum, gallbladder contraction was stimulated in order to release bile. The string was then retrieved via the mouth and bile samples were analyzed for drug-related material using spectrometric and spectroscopic techniques following solvent extraction. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) indicated that the O-glucuronide metabolite was the major metabolite of GSK1325756, representing approximately 80% of drug-related material in bile. As bile is the major clearance route for GSK1325756 (only 4% of the administered dose was excreted in human urine), this result indicates that uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) are the major drug metabolizing enzymes responsible for drug clearance. The relatively minor contribution made by oxidative routes reduces the concern of CYP-mediated victim drug interactions. The results from this study demonstrate the utility of deploying the Entero-Test® in early human studies to provide information on the biliary disposition of drugs and their metabolites. This technique can be readily applied in early clinical development studies to provide information on the risk of interactions for drugs that are metabolized and eliminated in bile.
15304427	Cytochrome P450 3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of the substance P receptor antagonist aprepitant. The contribution of human cytochrome P450 (P450) isoforms to the metabolism of aprepitant in humans was investigated using recombinant P450s and inhibition studies. In addition, aprepitant was evaluated as an inhibitor of human P450s. Metabolism of aprepitant by microsomes prepared from baculovirus-expressed human P450s was observed only when CYP1A2, CYP2C19, or CYP3A4 was present in the expression system. Incubation with CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 yielded only products of O-dealkylation, whereas CYP3A4 catalyzed both N- and O-dealkylation reactions. The metabolism of aprepitant by human liver microsomes was inhibited completely by ketoconazole or troleandomycin. No inhibition was observed with other P450 isoform-selective inhibitors. Aprepitant was evaluated also as a P450 inhibitor in human liver microsomes. No significant inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1 was observed in experiments with isoform-specific substrates (IC50 > 70 microM). Aprepitant was a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4, with Ki values of approximately 10 microM for the 1'- and 4-hydroxylation of midazolam, and the N-demethylation of diltiazem, respectively. Aprepitant was a very weak inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, with Ki values of 108 and 66 microM for the 7-hydroxylation of warfarin and the 4'-hydroxylation of S-mephenytoin, respectively. Collectively, these results indicated that aprepitant is both a substrate and a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4.
20439609	Development of hexadecyloxypropyl tenofovir (CMX157) for treatment of infection caused by wild-type and nucleoside/nucleotide-resistant HIV. CMX157 is a lipid (1-0-hexadecyloxypropyl) conjugate of the acyclic nucleotide analog tenofovir (TFV) with activity against both wild-type and antiretroviral drug-resistant HIV strains, including multidrug nucleoside/nucleotide analog-resistant viruses. CMX157 was consistently >300-fold more active than tenofovir against multiple viruses in several different cell systems. CMX157 was active against all major subtypes of HIV-1 and HIV-2 in fresh human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and against all HIV-1 strains evaluated in monocyte-derived macrophages, with 50% effective concentrations (EC(50)s) ranging between 0.20 and 7.2 nM. The lower CMX157 EC(50)s can be attributed to better cellular uptake of CMX157, resulting in higher intracellular levels of the active antiviral anabolite, TFV-diphosphate (TFV-PP), inside target cells. CMX157 produced >30-fold higher levels of TFV-PP in human PBMCs exposed to physiologically relevant concentrations of the compounds than did TFV. Unlike conventional prodrugs, including TFV disoproxil fumarate (Viread), CMX157 remains intact in plasma, facilitating uptake by target cells and decreasing relative systemic exposure to TFV. There was no detectable antagonism with CMX157 in combination with any marketed antiretroviral drug, and it possessed an excellent in vitro cytotoxicity profile. CMX157 is a promising clinical candidate to treat wild-type and antiretroviral drug-resistant HIV, including strains that fail to respond to all currently available nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors.
23610086	Reactive metabolite trapping studies on imidazo- and 2-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-based inverse agonists of the ghrelin receptor. The current study examined the bioactivation potential of ghrelin receptor inverse agonists, 1-{2-[2-chloro-4-(2H-1,2,3-triazol-2-yl)benzyl]-2,7-diazaspiro[3.5]nonan-7-yl}-2-(imidazo[2,1-b]thiazol-6-yl)ethanone (1) and 1-{2-[2-chloro-4-(2H-1,2,3-triazol-2-yl)benzyl]-2,7-diazaspiro[3.5]nonan-7-yl}-2-(2-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazol-6-yl)ethanone (2), containing a fused imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole motif in the core structure. Both compounds underwent oxidative metabolism in NADPH- and glutathione-supplemented human liver microsomes to yield glutathione conjugates, which was consistent with their bioactivation to reactive species. Mass spectral fragmentation and NMR analysis indicated that the site of attachment of the glutathionyl moiety in the thiol conjugates was on the thiazole ring within the bicycle. Two glutathione conjugates were discerned with the imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole derivative 1. One adduct was derived from the Michael addition of glutathione to a putative S-oxide metabolite of 1, whereas, the second adduct was formed via the reaction of a second glutathione molecule with the initial glutathione-S-oxide adduct. In the case of the 2-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole analog 2, glutathione conjugation occurred via an oxidative desulfation mechanism, possibly involving thiazole ring epoxidation as the rate-limiting step. Additional insights into the mechanism were obtained via ¹⁸O exchange and trapping studies with potassium cyanide. The mechanistic insights into the bioactivation pathways of 1 and 2 allowed the deployment of a rational chemical intervention strategy that involved replacement of the thiazole ring with a 1,2,4-thiadiazole group to yield 2-[2-chloro-4-(2H-1,2,3-triazol-2-yl)benzyl]-2,7-diazaspiro[3.5]nonan-7-yl)-2-(2-methylimidazo[2,1-b][1,3,4]thiadiazol-6-yl)ethanone (3). These structural changes not only abrogated the bioactivation liability but also retained the attractive pharmacological attributes of the prototype agents.
7586929	Effects of felbamate on the pharmacokinetics of the monohydroxy and dihydroxy metabolites of oxcarbazepine. The effects of felbamate on the multiple dose pharmacokinetics of the monohydroxy and dihydroxy metabolites of oxcarbazepine were assessed in a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind crossover study in 18 healthy male volunteers. Oxcarbazepine, 1200 mg/day, was administered on an open basis in combination with double-blind placebo or 2400 mg/day felbamate for two 10-day treatment periods separated by a 14-day washout period. Pharmacokinetic parameters of monohydroxyoxcarbazepine and dihydroxyoxcarbazepine were determined from plasma and urine samples obtained on the tenth day of each treatment period. Felbamate had no effect on monohydroxyoxcarbazepine plasma or urine pharmacokinetics compared with placebo, but it significantly increased values for dihydroxyoxcarbazepine maximum concentration and area under the curve from 0 to 12 hours, as well as urinary excretion of free and total dihydroxyoxcarbazepine. The mechanism that may account for the observations is the induction of oxidative metabolism of monohydroxyoxcarbazepine. Despite these changes, the relative amount of dihydroxyoxcarbazepine is small in comparison to monohydroxyoxcarbazepine, and antiepileptic activity is associated with monohydroxyoxcarbazepine rather than dihydroxyoxcarbazepine. Therefore we conclude that felbamate has no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of oxcarbazepine in humans.
16882767	Metabolism and disposition of vatalanib (PTK787/ZK-222584) in cancer patients. Vatalanib (PTK787/ZK-222584) is a new oral antiangiogenic molecule that inhibits all known vascular endothelial growth factor receptors. Vatalanib is under investigation for the treatment of solid tumors. Disposition and biotransformation of vatalanib were studied in an open-label, single-center study in patients with advanced cancer. Seven patients were given a single oral (14)C-radiolabeled dose of 1,000 mg of vatalanib administered at steady state, obtained after 14 consecutive daily oral doses of 1,000 mg of nonradiolabeled vatalanib. Plasma, urine, and feces were analyzed for radioactivity, vatalanib, and its metabolites. Metabolite patterns were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to radioactivity detection with off-line microplate solid scintillation counting and characterized by LC-MS. Vatalanib was well tolerated. The majority of adverse effects corresponded to common toxicity criteria grade 1 or 2. Two patients had stable disease for at least 7 months. Plasma C(max) values of (14)C radioactivity (38.3 +/- 26.0 microM; mean +/- S.D., n = 7) and vatalanib (15.8 +/- 9.5 microM) were reached after 2 and 1.5 h (median), respectively, indicating rapid onset of absorption. Terminal elimination half-lives in plasma were 23.4 +/- 5.5 h for (14)C radioactivity and 4.6 +/- 1.1 h for vatalanib. Vatalanib cleared mainly through oxidative metabolism. Two pharmacologically inactive metabolites, CGP-84368/ZK-260120 [(4-chlorophenyl)-[4-(1-oxy-pyridin-4-yl-methyl)-phthalazin-1-yl]-amine] and NVP-AAW378/ZK-261557 [rac-4-[(4-chloro-phenyl)amino]-alpha-(1-oxido-4-pyridyl)phthalazine-1-methanol], having systemic exposure comparable to that of vatalanib, contributed mainly to the total systemic exposure. Vatalanib and its metabolites were excreted rapidly and mainly via the biliary-fecal route. Excretion of radioactivity was largely complete, with a radiocarbon recovery between 67% and 96% of dose within 7 days (42-74% in feces, 13-29% in urine).
22765480	Metabolic activation and major protein target of a 1-benzyl-3-carboxyazetidine sphingosine-1-phosphate-1 receptor agonist. 1-{4-[(4-Phenyl-5-trifluoromethyl-2-thienyl)methoxy]benzyl}azetidine-3-carboxylic acid (MRL-A) is a potent sphingosine-1-phosphate-1 receptor agonist, with potential application as an immunosuppressant in organ transplantation or for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. When administered orally to rats, radiolabeled MRL-A was found to undergo metabolism to several reactive intermediates, and in this study, we have investigated its potential for protein modification in vivo and in vitro. MRL-A irreversibly modified liver and kidney proteins in vivo, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The binding was found to occur selectively to microsomal and mitochondrial subcellular fractions. Following a nonspecific proteolytic digestion of liver and kidney proteins, a single major amino acid adduct was observed. This adduct was characterized with LC/MS/UV and NMR spectroscopy and was found to be the product of an unprecedented metabolic activation of the azetidine moiety leading to the formation of a ring-opened α,β-unsaturated imine conjugated to the ε-amino group of a lysine residue. The formation of this adduct was not inhibited when rats were pretreated with 1-aminobenzotriazole, indicating that P450 enzymes were not involved in the metabolic activation of MRL-A. Rather, our findings suggested that MRL-A underwent bioactivation via a β-oxidation pathway. Several other minor adducts were identified from protein hydrolysates and included lysine, serine, and cysteine conjugates of MRL-A. These minor adducts were also detected in microsomal incubations fortified with the cofactors for acyl-CoA synthesis and in hepatocytes. Trypsin digestion of crude liver homogenates from rats treated with radiolabeled MRL-A led to the identification of a single radioactive peptide. Its sequence, determined by LC/MS analysis, revealed that the target of the major reactive species of MRL-A in vivo is Lys676 of long chain acyl-CoA synthetase-1 (ACSL1). This lysine residue has been found to be critical for ACSL1 activity, and its modification has the potential to lead to biological consequences such as cardiac hypertrophy or thermogenesis dysregulation.
18420784	Metabolism and disposition of dasatinib after oral administration to humans. SPRYCEL (dasatinib, BMS-354825; Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ), a multiple kinase inhibitor, is currently approved to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia tumors in patients who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib mesylate (Gleevec; Novartis, Basel, Switzerland). After a 100-mg single p.o. dose of [(14)C]dasatinib to healthy volunteers, the radioactivity was rapidly absorbed (T(max) approximately 0.5 h). Both dasatinib and total radioactivity (TRA) plasma concentrations decreased rapidly with elimination half-life values of <4 h. Dasatinib was the major drug-related component in human plasma. At 2 h, dasatinib accounted for 25% of the TRA in plasma, suggesting that metabolites contributed significantly to the total drug-related component. There were many circulating metabolites detected that included hydroxylated metabolites (M20 and M24), an N-dealkylated metabolite (M4), an N-oxide (M5), an acid metabolite (M6), glucuronide conjugates (M8a,b), and products of further metabolism of these primary metabolites. Most of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in the feces (85%). Urine recovery accounted for <4% of the dose. Dasatinib accounted for <1 and 19% of the dose in urine and feces, respectively, suggesting that dasatinib was well absorbed after p.o. administration and extensively metabolized before being eliminated from the body. The exposures of pharmacologically active metabolites M4, M5, M6, M20, and M24 in patients, along with their cell-based IC(50) for Src and Bcr-Abl kinase inhibition, suggested that these metabolites were not expected to contribute significantly toward in vivo activity.
22981147	Pharmacokinetic comparison of the maleate and free base formulations of LB80380, a novel nucleotide analog, in healthy male volunteers. LB80380, a dipivoxil ester prodrug of LB80331, is a novel antiviral agent for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. The aim of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetic differences after single oral administrations of the free base and maleate formulations of LB80380 in healthy male subjects. An open-label, single- dose, randomized-sequence, 2-treatment crossover study was conducted in 32 Korean male volunteers. Subjects received either a combination of 60 and 90 mg tablets of the free base LB80380 formulation or a 183 mg (150 mg as a free base) tablet of the maleate LB80380 formulation. Then, after a 14- day washout period, each subject received the other formulation. Plasma and urine concentrations of LB80331 and LB80317 (active metabolites of LB80380) were measured by validated liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry assays. A safety assessment, which included vital signs, adverse events, electrocardiograms and clinical laboratory tests, was performed for each subject. A total of 32 healthy subjects was enrolled, and 26 subjects completed the study. Single oral administrations of LB80380 maleate tablets did not result in clinically significant differences in the safety profile compared to the LB80380 free base tablets. The 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the geometric mean ratios of Cmax and AUClast for LB80331 of the two treatments (maleate versus free base formulation) were 0.986 - 1.1240 and 0.9848 - 1.0533, respectively. The 90% CIs for the geometric mean ratios of Cmax and AUClast for LB80317 were 0.8379 - 0.9696 and 0.7224 - 0.9196. In healthy male subjects, the 183 mg LB80380 maleate tablet was pharmacokinetically equivalent to the 60 and 90 mg LB80380 free base tablets.
22081503	Determination of salbutamol and salbutamol glucuronide in human urine by means of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The determination of salbutamol and its glucuronide in human urine following the inhalative and oral administration of therapeutic doses of salbutamol preparations was performed by means of direct urine injection utilizing liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and employing d(3)-salbutamol and d(3)-salbutamol glucuronide as internal standards. Unconjugated salbutamol was detected in all administration study urine samples. Salbutamol concentrations following inhalation were commonly (99%) below 1000 ng/ml whereas values after oral administration frequently (48%) exceeded this threshold. While salbutamol glucuronide was not detected in urine samples collected after inhalation of the drug, 26 out of 82 specimens obtained after oral application contained salbutamol glucuronide with a peak value of 63 ng/ml. The percentage of salbutamol glucuronide compared to unconjugated salbutamol was less than 3%. Authentic doping control urine samples indicating screening results for salbutamol less than 1000 ng/ml, showed salbutamol glucuronide concentrations between 2 and 6 ng/ml, whereas adverse analytical findings resulting from salbutamol levels higher than 1000 ng/ml, had salbutamol glucuronide values between 8 and 15 ng/ml. The approach enabled the rapid determination of salbutamol and its glucuronic acid conjugate in human urine and represents an alternative to existing procedures since time-consuming hydrolysis or derivatization steps were omitted. Moreover, the excretion of salbutamol glucuronide in human urine following the administration of salbutamol was proven.
16988203	Investigation of a potential food effect on the pharmacokinetics of roflumilast, an oral, once-daily phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, in healthy subjects. This open, randomized, single-dose crossover study investigated effects of a high-fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of roflumilast and its major active N-oxide metabolite. Twelve healthy subjects received oral roflumilast 500 microg (2 x 250 microg) after overnight fasting and after breakfast. Blood was sampled up to 54 hours for pharmacokinetic profiling of roflumilast and N-oxide. Geometric mean ratios (fed/fasted) for point estimates (PE) and 90% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for AUC(0-last), AUC(0-infinity), and C(max) of both compounds. After the meal, roflumilast C(max) (PE, 0.59; 90% CI, 0.49-0.70) was modestly reduced; N-oxide C(max) (PE, 0.95; 90% CI, 0.90-1.01) was unchanged. Roflumilast t(max) was delayed in fed state (2.0 +/- 0.4 hours) versus fasted state (1.0 +/- 0.2 hours); N-oxide t(max) was unaltered. No significant food effect on roflumilast AUC(0-last) (PE, 1.04; 90% CI, 0.90-1.21), AUC(0-infinity) (PE, 1.12; 90% CI, 1.00-1.25), and respective N-oxide AUCs (PE, 0.91; 90% CI, 0.79-1.04; PE, 0.99; 90% CI, 0.92-1.06) occurred. Because roflumilast N-oxide is the major contributor to roflumilast's overall pharmacologic effects, these findings suggest that roflumilast can be taken with or without food.
8477556	Inhibition by fluoxetine of cytochrome P450 2D6 activity. Potent inhibition of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) in human liver microsomes by fluoxetine and its major metabolite norfluoxetine was confirmed (apparent inhibition constant values, 0.2 mumol/L). Several other serotonergic agents were also found to be competitive inhibitors of this genetically polymorphic enzyme. The O-demethylation ratio of dextromethorphan that expressed CYP2D6 activity in 19 patients receiving fluoxetine fell in the region of the antimode separating the O-demethylation ratio values observed in 208 extensive metabolizers from 15 poor metabolizers of a control group of healthy subjects. Inhibition of CYP2D6 activity in patients undergoing treatment with fluoxetine or other serotonin uptake inhibitors could contribute to toxicity or attenuated response from concurrent medications that are substrates of this enzyme. Other in vitro studies indicated that CYP2D6 catalyzes the O-demethylation of oxycodone to form oxymorphone. This reaction was inhibited by fluoxetine and its normetabolite in liver microsomes from both extensive and poor metabolizer individuals, indicating that these compounds are not selective inhibitors of CYP2D6 activity.
17725877	Toxicological screening in urine: comparison of two automated HPLC screening systems, toxicological identification system (TOX.I.S.*) versus REMEDI-HS. In this paper, the comparison of two automated high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) screening systems, a newly developed toxicological identification system (TOX.I.S.) versus the commercially available Remedi-HS (Bio-Rad), is presented. Urine samples from 405 cases screened positive for amphetamines, cocaine, and opiates by immunological assays and confirmed by GC-MS were analyzed with both systems. In more than 80% (TOX.I.S.) and 78% (Remedi-HS) of the cases (except for cocaine), the results obtained by both HPLC methods showed agreement with the earlier obtained results by immunoassay prescreening and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The evaluation showed that both automated HPLC methods led to comparable results and can be used alternatively. As the confirmation results for cocaine were rather poor (45% TOX.I.S., 54% Remedi-HS) in comparison to GC-MS, the TOX.I.S. was further optimized for the detection of the cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine (BEC). The BEC method improved the detectability of BEC from 45% to 80%. Besides confirmation screening, the use of both systems in cases of acute intoxications was investigated. Information about basic compounds was obtained from urine screening by both systems, which therefore were useful as complementary techniques in the toxicological laboratory. The TOX.I.S. offers advantages such as common equipment, modern software, and higher versatility with the opportunity to establish additional methods in the system.
15336366	Simultaneous determination of Aprepitant and two metabolites in human plasma by high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection. A method for the simultaneous determination of Aprepitant, I (5-[[2(R)-[1(R)-(3,5-bistrifluoromethylphenyl)ethoxy]-3(S)-(4-fluorophenyl) morpholin-4-yl]methyl]-2,4-dihydro-[1,2,4]triazol-3-one) and two active metabolites (II and III) in human plasma has been developed. The method was based on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometric (APCI-MS-MS) detection in positive ionization mode using a heated nebulizer interface. The analytes and internal standard (IV) (Fig. 1) were isolated from basified plasma using liquid-liquid extraction. The organic extracts were dried, reconstituted in mobile phase and injected into the HPLC-MS/MS system. The analytes were chromatographed on a narrow bore (50 mm x 2.0 mm, 3 microm) Keystone Scientific's Prism R.P. analytical column, with mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile (ACN):water containing trifluoroacetic acid with pH adjusted to 3 (40:60, v/v) pumped at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The MS-MS detection was performed on a Sciex API 3000 tandem mass spectrometer operated in selected reaction monitoring mode. The precursor-->product ion combinations of m/z 535-->277, 438-->180, 452-->223 and 503-->259 were used to quantify I, II, III, and IV, respectively, after chromatographic separation of the analytes. The assay was validated in the concentration range of 10-5000 ng/ml for I and II and 25-5000 ng/ml for III when 1 ml of plasma was processed. The precision of the assay (expressed as coefficient of variation, CV) was less than 10% at all concentrations within the standard curve range, with adequate assay accuracy. Matrix effect experiments were performed to demonstrate the absence of any significant change in ionization of the analytes when comparing neat standards to analytes in the presence of plasma matrix. This assay was utilized to support a clinical study where multiple oral doses of I were administered to healthy subjects to investigate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of Aprepitant. Concentrations of the two most active metabolites, which if present in high concentrations would increase the neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor occupancy level and therefore potentially contribute to the antiemetic action of Aprepitant, were determined.
22036030	Pharmacokinetics and metabolism of N-[N-[3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl) propyl]-α-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester, monohydrate (advantame) in the rat, dog, and man. The pharmacokinetics and metabolism of advantame were evaluated in rats, dogs, and humans. The oral pharmacokinetic studies using (14)C-advantame showed that advantame undergoes rapid but incomplete absorption, with an oral bioavailability of total radioactivity in the range of 4-23%. Data indicated that absorption was mainly as ANS9801-acid (de-esterified advantame), which was formed in the gastrointestinal tract as a result of the hydrolysis of the methyl ester group of the parent compound. In the dog, plasma ANS9801-acid was present largely in the form of an unidentified conjugate. Advantame (chiefly in the form of metabolites) was mainly excreted in the feces in rats, dogs, and humans (>80% in each species), with urinary excretion representing a minor route. The predominant metabolite of (14)C-advantame detected in the feces and the urine of rats, dogs, and humans was ANS9801-acid, with lower amounts of 3-[3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl]-1-propylamine (termed HU-1) or N-(3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxy phenyl))propyl-L-aspartic acid (termed HF-1) present, as well as other minor metabolites and areas of indistinct radioactivity. ANS9801-acid, HU-1, and HF-1 were detected and identified in the urine of rats, humans, and dogs, while ANS9801-acid and HF-1 were identified in the feces of humans and dogs. In the feces of rats, in addition to ANS9801-acid, other additional metabolites were detected, including demethylated ANS9801-acid (designated as RF-1) and another unidentified metabolite (designated as RF-2). Overall, the data show generally similar pharmacokinetics of advantame and ANS9801-acid in animals and in humans and close similarity with neotame. Metabolites of advantame that occur in humans are also found in the 2 species utilized in the toxicology studies, and the metabolism studies support the interpretation of safety data from studies conducted in rats and dogs.
16087699	Anti-AIDS agents 65: investigation of the in vitro oxidative metabolism of 3',4'-Di-O-(-)-camphanoyl-(+)-cis-khellactone derivatives as potent anti-hiv agents. 3',4'-Di-O-(-)-camphanoyl-(+)-cis-khellactone (DCK) is a synthetic khellactone ester that exhibits potent in vitro anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activity with a mechanism distinct from clinically used anti-HIV agents. Several series of mono- and di-substituted DCK derivatives (DCKs) have previously been synthesized, and their structure-activity relationships are well established. To optimize DCK as a drug lead and to guide further structural modifications, metabolic stabilities and metabolite structures were analyzed. In vitro metabolic stabilities of DCKs in human liver microsomes were assessed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection to establish structure-metabolism relationships (SMRs). HPLC coupled with ion trap mass spectrometry was used to identify the metabolite structures. The results indicated that DCKs undergo rapid oxidation on the lipophilic camphanoyl moieties and the substituents on the khellactone do not alter the rate or the metabolic pathways for this compound type. Our SMR and metabolite analysis study suggested that the two camphanoyl ester moieties are the determinants of the low metabolic stability and that structural alteration in the two esters may be necessary to improve metabolic profiles of DCKs.
19074524	Investigation of the in vitro metabolism of the analgesic flupirtine. The in vitro metabolism of flupirtine, ethyl-N-[2-amino-6-(4-fluorophenylmethyl-amino)pyridine-3-yl]carbamate, a centrally acting analgesic with muscle tone-reducing activity, was studied. Two flupirtine metabolites were already known: the N-acetylated analog D13223 and 4-fluorohippuric acid. The structure of flupirtine suggested that redox chemistry may play a role in metabolism, and cyclic voltammetry studies showed that the drug undergoes facile and irreversible redox reactions. Thus, oxidative metabolism was investigated first. With CYP3A1-induced rat liver microsomes an 18% turnover of flupirtine and a 20 to 25% turnover of D13223 took place over 30 min, but less than 5% turnover of flupirtine was observed with all human liver microsomal preparations tested, evidence that cytochrome P450 does not contribute appreciably to the metabolism in humans. Likewise, no involvement of human monoamine oxidase (isoforms A and B) was found for either flupirtine or D13223. In contrast, flupirtine was an excellent substrate for both human myeloperoxidase and horse radish peroxidase (HRP). These enzymes produced detectable amounts of oxidation products. Incubations of flupirtine with HRP produced an oxidation product that could be trapped with glutathione, the resulting glutathione conjugate was characterized by mass spectrometry and NMR. Metabolism of D13223 by both peroxidases was also observed but to a much lesser extent. Porcine liver esterases cleave the carbamate group of flupirtine, and both human N-acetyltransferases 1 and 2 acetylated the hydrolysis product, presumably descarboethoxyflupirtine, with nearly equal efficiencies to yield D13223. Incubations of human liver microsomes with flupirtine or the metabolite D13223 together with UDP-glucuronic acid gave two isomeric N-glucuronides in both cases.
19074975	Absorption, metabolism, and excretion of [14C]vildagliptin, a novel dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor, in humans. The absorption, metabolism, and excretion of (1-[[3-hydroxy-1-adamantyl) amino] acetyl]-2-cyano-(S)-pyrrolidine (vildagliptin), an orally active and highly selective dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, were evaluated in four healthy male subjects after a single p.o. 100-mg dose of [(14)C]vildagliptin. Serial blood and complete urine and feces were collected for 168 h postdose. Vildagliptin was rapidly absorbed, and peak plasma concentrations were attained at 1.1 h postdose. The fraction of drug absorbed was calculated to be at least 85.4%. Unchanged drug and a carboxylic acid metabolite (M20.7) were the major circulating components in plasma, accounting for 25.7% (vildagliptin) and 55% (M20.7) of total plasma radioactivity area under the curve. The terminal half-life of vildagliptin was 2.8 h. Complete recovery of the dose was achieved within 7 days, with 85.4% recovered in urine (22.6% unchanged drug) and the remainder in feces (4.54% unchanged drug). Vildagliptin was extensively metabolized via at least four pathways before excretion, with the major metabolite M20.7 resulting from cyano group hydrolysis, which is not mediated by cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes. Minor metabolites resulted from amide bond hydrolysis (M15.3), glucuronidation (M20.2), or oxidation on the pyrrolidine moiety of vildagliptin (M20.9 and M21.6). The diverse metabolic pathways combined with a lack of significant P450 metabolism (1.6% of the dose) make vildagliptin less susceptible to potential pharmacokinetic interactions with comedications of P450 inhibitors/inducers. Furthermore, as vildagliptin is not a P450 inhibitor, it is unlikely that vildagliptin would affect the metabolic clearance of comedications metabolized by P450 enzymes.
21457140	Disposition and mass balance of [14C]vernakalant after single intravenous and oral doses in healthy volunteers. Vernakalant hydrochloride is a novel antiarrhythmic drug for the rapid conversion of atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm and prevention of relapse. In this open-label, parallel design study, 8 healthy men received single 240-mg doses of [(14)C]vernakalant hydrochloride, given as a 10-minute intravenous (IV) infusion on day 1, and as an oral gel capsule on day 22. Plasma, urine, and fecal samples were collected for 7 days after dosing to measure vernakalant and its metabolites and to estimate mass balance of total [(14)C] recovery. The disposition and metabolic profile of vernakalant after both IV and oral administration, depended on cytochrome P450 (CYP)2D6 genotype. Vernakalant underwent rapid and extensive distribution during infusion, which resulted in similar maximum plasma concentrations in extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs) for IV but not oral administration. Vernakalant was metabolized rapidly and extensively to a 4-O-demethylated metabolite with glucuronidation in EMs; direct glucuronidation predominated in PMs. Slower clearance in PMs contributed to 3- and 6-fold higher drug exposure (AUC(0-∞); IV and oral dosing, respectively). Urinary recovery of unchanged vernakalant was higher in PMs as well. Total [(14)C] was recovered predominantly in urine, while lower levels were recovered in feces. Mass balance was achieved, with a mean recovery of 99.7% of the IV dose and 98.7% of the oral dose, in EMs, and 89.2% and 88.2% of the IV and oral doses, respectively, in PMs. Vernakalant was well tolerated. The pharmacokinetics and metabolism of vernakalant depend on CYP2D6 genotype with more pronounced effects on exposure following oral administration; however, the differences between EMs and PMs are unlikely to be clinically significant following short-term IV infusion.
22496391	Characterization of the in vitro and in vivo metabolism and disposition and cytochrome P450 inhibition/induction profile of saxagliptin in human. Saxagliptin is a potent dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pharmacokinetics and disposition of [(14)C]saxagliptin were investigated in healthy male subjects after a single 50-mg (91.5 μCi) oral dose. Saxagliptin was rapidly absorbed (T(max), 0.5 h). Unchanged saxagliptin and 5-hydroxy saxagliptin (M2), a major, active metabolite, were the prominent drug-related components in the plasma, together accounting for most of the circulating radioactivity. Approximately 97% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the excreta within 7 days postdose, of which 74.9% was eliminated in the urine and 22.1% was excreted in the feces. The parent compound and M2 represented 24.0 and 44.1%, respectively, of the radioactivity recovered in the urine and feces combined. Taken together, the excretion data suggest that saxagliptin was well absorbed and was subsequently cleared by both urinary excretion and metabolism; the formation of M2 was the major metabolic pathway. Additional minor metabolic pathways included hydroxylation at other positions and glucuronide or sulfate conjugation. Cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 metabolized saxagliptin and formed M2. Kinetic experiments indicated that the catalytic efficiency (V(max)/K(m)) for CYP3A4 was approximately 4-fold higher than that for CYP3A5. Therefore, it is unlikely that variability in expression levels of CYP3A5 due to genetic polymorphism will impact clearance of saxagliptin. Saxagliptin and M2 each showed little potential to inhibit or induce important P450 enzymes, suggesting that saxagliptin is unlikely to affect the metabolic clearance of coadministered drugs that are substrates for these enzymes.
16005690	Simultaneous determination of clobazam and its major metabolite in human plasma by a rapid HPLC method. A rapid and specific HPLC method has been developed and validated for simultaneous determination of clobazam, the anticonvulsant agent, and its major metabolite in human plasma. The sample preparation was a liquid-liquid extraction with tuloene yielding almost near 100% recoveries of two compounds. Chromatographic separation was achieved with a Chromolith Performance RP-18e 100 mm x 4.6mm column, using a mixture of a phosphate buffer (pH 3.5; 10mM)-acetonitrile (70:30, v/v), in isocratic mode at 2 ml/min at a detection wave-length of 228 nm. The calibration curves were linear (r(2)>0.998) in the concentration range of 5-450 ng ml(-1). The lower limit of quantification was 5 ng ml(-1) for two compounds studied. The within- and between-day precisions in the measurement of QC samples at four tested concentrations were in the range of 0.89-9.1% and 2.1-10.1% R.S.D., respectively. The developed procedure was applied to assess the pharmacokinetics of clobazam and its major metabolite following administration of a single 10mg oral dose of clobazam to healthy volunteers.
11452239	Orally given melatonin may serve as a probe drug for cytochrome P450 1A2 activity in vivo: a pilot study. Melatonin is a hormone that is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 to its main primary metabolite 6-hydroxymelatonin. We therefore evaluated the utility of oral melatonin as a marker of hepatic CYP1A2 activity. Twenty-five milligrams of melatonin was given at 9:30 am to 12 healthy Swedish volunteers, who had previously been phenotyped for CYP1A2 with caffeine. Melatonin and conjugated 6-hydroxymelatonin were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in blood samples taken between 0.5 and 6.5 hours after drug intake. Serum concentrations of melatonin and conjugated 6-hydroxymelatonin, or their ratio at different time points, and the apparent melatonin clearance were tested for correlation with caffeine clearance. We found a significant correlation between apparent clearance of melatonin and caffeine clearance with a Spearman rank correlation coefficient (Rs) of 0.75 (P =.005). The melatonin concentration 1.5 hours after administration also closely correlated with the caffeine clearance (Rs = -0.62; P =.03). Inclusion of conjugated 6-hydroxymelatonin gave no closer correlations. Melatonin might be developed as an alternative to caffeine as a probe drug for CYP1A2 phenotyping.
3838755	63Ni electron-capture gas chromatographic assay for buprenorphine and metabolites in human urine and feces. A 63Ni electron-capture gas chromatographic assay is described for buprenorphine, a potent narcotic agonist--antagonist. In addition, the assay is useful for the measurement of the metabolite norbuprenorphine and demethoxybuprenorphine, a rearrangement product resulting when buprenorphine is exposed to acid and heat. An extraction procedure was developed which optimized recovery of buprenorphine from biological samples and produced minimal background interferences and emulsion problems. Extract residues were derivatized with pentafluoropropionic anhydride and assayed by gas chromatography. Samples were analyzed with and without enzyme hydrolysis, thus providing a selective and sensitive assay for both free and conjugated buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine and demethoxybuprenorphine. The lower limits of detection following extraction of a 1-ml sample were ca. 10 ng/ml for buprenorphine and demethoxybuprenorphine and 5 ng/ml for norbuprenorphine. Application of the assay to human samples following a 40-mg oral dose of buprenorphine produced no evidence for the presence of demethoxybuprenorphine in urine or feces. Norbuprenorphine (free and conjugated) was present in urinary and fecal samples; buprenorphine (free and conjugated) was found in high amounts only in feces and in trace amounts in urine as conjugated buprenorphine. The urinary and fecal excretion pattern observed for a human subject following oral dosing of buprenorphine suggests enterohepatic circulation of buprenorphine.
20308471	Role of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase isoforms in 13-cis retinoic acid metabolism in humans. 13-cis Retinoic acid (13cisRA, isotretinoin) is an important drug in both dermatology, and the treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma. 13cisRA is known to undergo cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation, mainly by CYP2C8, but phase II metabolic pathways have not been characterized. In the present study, the glucuronidation activities of human liver (HLM) and intestinal microsomes (HIM), as well as a panel of human UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) toward both 13cisRA and the 4-oxo metabolite, 4-oxo 13cisRA, were compared using high-performance liquid chromatography. Both HLM and, to a greater extent, HIM catalyzed the glucuronidation of 13cisRA and 4-oxo 13cisRA. Based on the structures of 13cisRA and 4-oxo 13cisRA, the glucuronides formed are conjugated at the terminal carboxylic acid. Further analysis revealed that UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A7, UGT1A8, and UGT1A9 were the major isoforms responsible for the glucuronidation of both substrates. For 13cisRA, a pronounced substrate inhibition was observed with individual UGTs and with HIM. UGT1A3 exhibited the highest rate of activity toward both substrates, and a high rate of activity toward 13cisRA glucuronidation was also observed with UGT1A7. However, for both substrates, K(m) values were above concentrations reported in clinical studies. Therefore, UGT1A9 is likely to be the most important enzyme in the glucuronidation of both substrates as this enzyme had the lowest K(m) and is expressed in both the intestine and at high levels in the liver.
12183642	Pharmacology of INS37217 [P(1)-(uridine 5')-P(4)- (2'-deoxycytidine 5')tetraphosphate, tetrasodium salt], a next-generation P2Y(2) receptor agonist for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. INS37217 [P(1)-(uridine 5')-P(4)-(2'-deoxycytidine 5')tetraphosphate, tetrasodium salt] is a deoxycytidine-uridine dinucleotide with agonist activity at the P2Y(2) receptor. In primate lung tissues, the P2Y(2) receptor mRNA was located by in situ hybridization predominantly in epithelial cells and not in smooth muscle or stromal tissue. The pharmacologic profile of INS37217 parallels that of UTP, leading to increased chloride and water secretion, increased cilia beat frequency, and increased mucin release. The combined effect of these actions was confirmed in an animal model of tracheal mucus velocity that showed that a single administration of INS37217 significantly enhanced mucus transport for at least 8 h after dosing. This extended duration of action is consistent with the ability of INS37217 to resist metabolism by airway cells and sputum enzymes. The enhanced metabolic stability and resultant increased duration of improved mucociliary clearance may confer significant advantages to INS37217 over other P2Y(2) agonists in the treatment of diseases such as cystic fibrosis.
15342469	Identification and characterization of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in Schisandra fruit extract. Schisandra fruit, a Schisandraceae family herb, is used as a component in Kampo medicines (developed from Chinese medicines, but established in Japan). It can act as a sedative and antitussive, improve hepatic function, and give a general tonic effect. An extract of Schisandra fruit has been shown with a potent inhibitory effect on human liver microsomal erythromycin N-demethylation activity mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). The present study was conducted to identify Schisandra fruit components having inhibitory effects on CYP3A4 by surveying the effect on human liver microsomal erythromycin N-demethylation activity. Known components of Schisandra fruit, gomisins B, C, G, and N and gamma-shizandrin, showed inhibitory effects on N-demethylation activity. Among these components, gomisin C displayed the most potent and competitive inhibitory effect, with a Ki value of 0.049 microM. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of gomisin C was stronger than that of ketoconazole (Ki = 0.070 microM), a known potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Gomisin C, however, inhibited CYP1A2-, CYP2C9-, CYP2C19-, and CYP2D6-dependent activities only to a limited extent (IC50 values >10 microM). Moreover, gomisin C inactivated human liver microsomal erythromycin N-demethylation activity in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The inactivation kinetic parameters k(inact) and K(I) were 0.092 min(-1) and 0.399 microM, respectively. The human liver microsomal erythromycin N-demethylation activity inactivated by gomisin C did not recover on dialysis of the microsomes. Spectral scanning of CYP3A4 with gomisin C yielded an absorbance at 455 nm, suggesting that gomisin C inactivated the cytochrome P450 via the formation of a metabolite intermediate complex. This pattern is consistent with the metabolism of the methylenedioxy substituent in gomisin C. These results indicate that gomisin C is a mechanism-based inhibitor that not only competitively inhibits but irreversibly inactivates CYP3A4.
17090147	Absorption, metabolism, and antioxidant effects of pomegranate (Punica granatum l.) polyphenols after ingestion of a standardized extract in healthy human volunteers. The intake of polyphenols has been demonstrated to have health-promoting and disease-preventive effects. The pomegranate (Punica granatum L.), which is rich in several polyphenols, has been used for centuries in ancient cultures for its medicinal purposes. The potential health benefits of pomegranate polyphenols have been demonstrated in numerous in vitro studies and in vivo experiments. This study investigated the absorption and antioxidant effects of a standardized extract from pomegranate in healthy human volunteers after the acute consumption of 800 mg of extract. Results indicate that ellagic acid (EA) from the extract is bioavailable, with an observed C(max) of 33 ng/mL at t(max) of 1 h. The plasma metabolites urolithin A, urolithin B, hydroxyl-urolithin A, urolithin A-glucuronide, and dimethyl ellagic acid-glucuronide were identified by HPLC-MS. The antioxidant capacity measured with the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay was increased with a maximum effect of 32% after 0.5 h, whereas the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was not affected. The inflammation marker interleukin-6 (IL-6) was not significantly affected after 4 h after the consumption of the extract. Overall, this study demonstrated the absorbability of EA from a pomegranate extract high in ellagitannin content and its ex vivo antioxidant effects.
7734934	A highly sensitive method to quantify triazolam and its metabolites with liquid chromatography--mass spectrometry. We established a highly sensitive method to determine triazolam and its major metabolites, alpha-hydroxytriazolam and 4-hydroxytriazolam, in human plasma and urine with a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry system which incorporates an atmospheric chemical ionization interface. A plasma sample and a urine sample after solvent extraction were injected into an ODS column of reversed phase with a mobile phase in a linear solvent gradient of initially 50 mM ammonium acetate (pH 4.0) 50%:methanol 50% and 15 min later methanol 100%; quantification limits of as low as 20 pg/mL at an SNR of 3 were obtained for each compound. With diazepam as an internal standard, recovery yields of 84, 81, and 77% were obtained for triazolam, alpha-hydroxytriazolam and 4-hydroxytriazolam, respectively.
16167835	Zafirlukast metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4 produces an electrophilic alpha,beta-unsaturated iminium species that results in the selective mechanism-based inactivation of the enzyme. Zafirlukast is a leukotriene antagonist indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate asthma, but the drug has been associated with occasional idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity. Structurally, zafirlukast is similar to 3-methylindole because it contains an N-methylindole moiety that has a 3-alkyl substituent on the indole ring. The results presented here describe the metabolic activation of zafirlukast via a similar mechanism to that described for 3-methylindole. NADP(H)-dependent biotransformation of zafirlukast by hepatic microsomes from rats and humans afforded a reactive metabolite, which was detected as its GSH adduct. Mass spectrometry and NMR data indicated that the GSH adduct was formed by the addition of GSH to the methylene carbon between the indole- and methoxy-substituted phenyl rings of zafirlukast. The formation of this reactive metabolite in human liver microsomes was shown to be exclusively catalyzed by CYP3A enzymes. Evidence for in vivo metabolic activation of zafirlukast was obtained when the same GSH adduct was detected in bile of rats given an iv or oral dose of the drug. On the basis of results with model peroxidases and of the structures of product alcohols from incubations containing H2(18)O, it appeared that zafirlukast underwent dehydrogenation by two sequential one-electron oxidations. In addition, zafirlukast proved to be a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A4 activity in human liver microsomes and in microsomes containing cDNA-expressed CYP3A4. The enzyme inhibitory property of zafirlukast was selective for this enzyme among all of the P450 enzymes that were tested in human liver microsomes. The inactivation was characterized by a K(I) of 13.4 microM and k(inact) of 0.026 min(-1). In summary, zafirlukast dehydrogenation to an electrophilic alpha,beta-unsaturated iminium intermediate may be associated with idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity and/or cause drug-drug interactions through inactivation of CYP3A4.
24043137	Phase I study of the safety, pharmacokinetics and antitumor activity of famitinib. To evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and antitumor activities of famitinib (famitinib L-malate), a novel oral multitargeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor that acts against vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, stem cell factor receptor (c-kit), FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 receptor and protooncogene tyrosine kinase receptor in patients with advanced solid cancer. Patients received once daily oral famitinib. Doses were increased from 4 to 8, 13, 20, 27, 24, 25 and eventually 30 mg. Each cycle was defined as 28 days. The pharmacokinetic profile and various biomarkers were evaluated during the first cycle. Antitumor efficacy was evaluated every 8 weeks. Fifty-four patients were evaluable for safety and efficacy. Dose-limiting toxicities were observed in 2 of 3 patients at 30 mg. The dose-limiting toxicities observed in the first cycle of famitinib treatment included hypertension, hand-foot skin reaction and diarrhea. Grade 3 hypertriglyceridemia/hypercholesterolemia and proteinuria were notable side effects in the subsequent treatment cycles. Other common side effects included bone marrow suppression, oral mucositis, fatigue, pain, elevated transaminase or bilirubin, peripheral sensory disturbance and hypothyroidism, most of which were mild to moderate in severity. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed no significant accumulation of famitinib or its major metabolite, M3. The half-lives of famitinib and M3 were approximately 28.7-33.8 and 41.3-47.7 h, respectively. Food demonstrated a minimal effect on the pharmacokinetics of famitinib. Eight partial responses were determined, including 6 cases of renal cell carcinoma, 1 case of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and 1 case of alveolar soft part sarcoma. Fourteen patients demonstrated stable disease with various degrees of tumor shrinkage. Famitinib is generally well tolerated. Famitinib demonstrates a wide spectrum of antitumor activities, which warrants further study in renal cell carcinoma, GIST, hepatocellular carcinoma and soft tissue sarcoma. The recommended dose for future phase II clinical trials is 25 mg.
19464879	R(+)XK469 inhibits hydroxylation of S-warfarin by CYP2C9. XK469 is a novel topoisomerase II inhibitor structurally akin to several propionic acid derivatives, such as ibuprofen and diclofenac, which are metabolised by CYP2C9. We report eight subjects who experienced significant elevation of INR while receiving concomitant R(+)XK469 and warfarin. The aim of the study is to investigate whether R(+)XK469 interacts with S-warfarin by inhibition of CYP2C9. The effect of R(+)XK469 on S-warfarin hydroxylation was determined by the measurement of S-7-hydroxywarfarin formation in pooled human liver microsomes and cDNA-expressed CYP2C9. R(+)XK469 competitively inhibited S-warfarin hydroxylation. The K(i) values of R(+)XK469 were estimated to be 959+/-426 microM for human liver microsomes and to be 377+/-92 microM for CYP2C9. At the recommended phase II dose of R(+)XK469, the ratio of C(max)/K(i) is >1. This suggests that coadministration of R(+)XK469 and warfarin results in a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction due to CYP2C9 inhibition by R(+)XK469.
1957331	Pharmacokinetics of digoxin and main metabolites/derivatives in healthy humans. Three healthy, young male volunteers received doses of 0.6 and 1.2 mg of specifically labelled [3H]digoxin each by intravenous (i.v.) bolus injection and oral (p.o.) administration in accordance with a randomized four-way crossover design. Plasma, urine, and feces samples were taken over an interval of 144 h after drug administration. Total radioactivity and individual radioactivity assignable to digoxin and its metabolites were measured. After i.v. administration, the mean +/- SD recovery of total radioactivity, as percent of dose, was complete, urine 81.3 +/- 2.0% and feces 17.1 +/- 2.8%. The mean recovery of digoxin and that of its metabolites in urine was digoxin 75.6 +/- 3.0%, dihydrodigoxin 2.8 +/- 1.6%, digoxigenin bisdigitoxoside 1.6 +/- 0.1%, and additional metabolites 1.5 +/- 0.3%. Judging from the metabolite data in urine and considering the 5% impurity of the administered dose, metabolism of digoxin appeared to be insignificant after i.v. administration. The total and renal clearances of digoxin were, on average, 193 +/- 25 ml min-1 and 152 +/- 24 ml min-1. The mean steady state volume of distribution was 489 +/- 73 L and the mean residence time 41 +/- 5 h. For the metabolites dihydrodigoxin and digoxigenin bisdigitoxoside the mean residence times were on average 35 +/- 9 h and 53 +/- 11 h; the renal clearances were 79 +/- 13 ml min-1 and 100 +/- 26 ml min-1. After p.o. administration, the mean recovery of total radioactivity, as percent of the dose, was also complete, urine 65.7 +/- 1.98% and feces 31.6 +/- 7.6%. The mean recovery of digoxin and that of its metabolites, as percent of dose, in urine was digoxin 51.5 +/- 11.4%, dihydrodigoxin 4.5 +/- 3.9%, digoxigenin bisdigitoxoside 1.9 +/- 0.1%, polar metabolites 5.5 +/- 3.8%, and additional metabolites 1.3 +/- 0.6%. After p.o., as compared to i.v. administration, larger amounts of all the metabolites were formed in accordance with first pass metabolism/degradation. Maximum mean plasma concentrations of 4.3 +/- 2.5 ng ml-1 and 9.5 +/- 1.1 ng ml-1 for digoxin were observed at 40 +/- 10 min after p.o. administration of 0.6 and 1.2 mg of the drug. The mean absolute bioavailability of digoxin from an aqueous solution was 0.67 +/- 0.14. Renal clearance and mean oral residence time for digoxin were on average 176 +/- 28 ml min-1 and 37 +/- 4 h after p.o. administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
17108060	Effects of green tea compounds on irinotecan metabolism. The effects of green tea compounds on the metabolism of irinotecan have never been investigated. We aimed to study whether catechins [(-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), (-)-epicatechin gallate (ECG), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (-)-epicatechin] affect the inactivation metabolism of irinotecan into 7-ethyl-10-[4-N-(1-piperidino)-1-amino]carbonyloxycamptothecin (NPC) (by CYP3A4) and 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38) into 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin glucuronide (SN-38G) (by UGT1A1). Human liver microsomes, hepatocytes and Hep G2 cells were incubated with catechins and treated with irinotecan and/or SN-38. NPC and SN-38G formation was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. UGT1A1 mRNA levels were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. In human liver microsomes, a concentration-dependent decrease in the formation of NPC and SN-38G was observed. In human hepatocytes, a significant increase in SN-38G production was observed in 33% (EGCG), 44% (ECG), and 44% (EGC) of the hepatocyte preparations. Phenobarbital increased the formation of SN-38G in 100% of the same hepatocyte preparations. In Hep G2 cells, no increase in SN-38G formation was observed. With the exception of ECG in one liver, catechins did not increase UGT1A1 mRNA levels. NPC production was also significantly increased in 40% of the hepatocyte preparations for each catechin. However, the production of 6beta-hydroxytestosterone remained unaffected in other hepatocyte preparations. At pharmacologically relevant concentrations, catechins are unlikely to inhibit the formation of irinotecan inactive metabolites when administered concomitantly. The induction effect of catechins on UGT1A1 seems to be modest and highly variable. Catechins do not induce CYP3A4 activity. The effect of acute and prolonged use of green tea on the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan in patients remains to be evaluated.
20823282	Pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics of once-daily raltegravir and atazanavir in healthy volunteers. Atazanavir inhibits UDP-glucuronyl-transferase-1A1 (UGT1A1), which metabolizes raltegravir, but the magnitude of steady-state inhibition and role of the UGT1A1 genotype are unknown. Sufficient inhibition could lead to reduced-dose and -cost raltegravir regimens. Nineteen healthy volunteers, age 24 to 51 years, took raltegravir 400 mg twice daily (arm A) and 400 mg plus atazanavir 400 mg once daily (arm B), separated by ≥3 days, in a crossover design. After 1 week on each regimen, raltegravir and raltegravir-glucuronide plasma and urine concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in multiple samples obtained over 12 h (arm A) or 24 h (arm B) and analyzed by noncompartmental methods. UGT1A1 promoter variants were detected with a commercially available kit and published primers. The primary outcome was the ratio of plasma raltegravir C(tau), or concentration at the end of the dosing interval, for arm B (24 h) versus arm A (12 h). The arm B-to-arm A geometric mean ratios (95% confidence interval, P value) for plasma raltegravir C(tau), area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 h (AUC(0-12)), and raltegravir-glucuronide/raltegravir AUC(0-12) were 0.38 (0.22 to 0.65, 0.001), 1.32 (0.62 to 2.81, 0.45), and 0.47 (0.38 to 0.59, <0.001), respectively. Nine volunteers were heterozygous and one was homozygous for a UGT1A1 reduction-of-function allele, but these were not associated with metabolite formation. Although atazanavir significantly reduced the formation of the glucuronide metabolite, its steady-state boosting of plasma raltegravir did not render the C(tau) with a once-daily raltegravir dose of 400 mg similar to the C(tau) with the standard twice-daily dose. UGT1A1 promoter variants did not significantly influence this interaction.
22054099	Determination of cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of (-)-terpinen-4-ol by human liver microsomes. The in vitro metabolism of (-)-terpinen-4-ol was examined in human liver microsomes and recombinant enzymes. The biotransformation of (-)-terpinen-4-ol was investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. (-)-Terpinen-4-ol was found to be oxidized to (-)-(1S,2R,4R)-1,2-epoxy-p-menthan-4-ol, major metabolic product by human liver microsomal P450 enzymes. The formation of metabolites of (-)-terpinen-4-ol was determined by relative abundance of mass fragments and retention times on GC. CYP2A6 in human liver microsomes was a major enzyme involved in the oxidation of (-)-terpinen-4-ol by human liver microsomes, based on the following lines of evidence. First, of 11 recombinant human P450 enzymes tested, CYP2A6 had the highest activity for oxidation of (-)-terpinen-4-ol. Second, oxidation of (-)-terpinen-4-ol was inhibited by (+)-menthofuran. Finally, there was a good correlation between CYP2A6 maker activity and (-)-terpinen-4-ol oxidation activities in liver microsomes of 10 human samples. Kinetic analysis showed that the V(max)/K(m) values for (-)-(1S,2R,4R)-1,2-epoxy-p-menthan-4-ol catalysed by liver microsomes of human sample HH-18 was 2.49 μL/min/nmol. Human recombinant CYP2A6 catalysed (-)-(1S,2R,4R)-1,2-epoxy-p-menthan-4-ol with V(max) values of 13.9 nmol/min/nmol P450 and apparent K(m) values of 91 μM.
22237256	Oral flurbiprofen metabolic ratio assessment using a single-point dried blood spot. We investigated whether a single blood measurement using the minimally invasive technique of a finger prick to draw a blood sample of 5 µl (to yield a dried blood spot (DBS)) is suitable for the assessment of flurbiprofen (FLB) metabolic ratio (MR). Ten healthy volunteers who had been genotyped for CYP2C9 were recruited as subjects. They received FLB alone in session 1 and FLB with fluconazole in session 2. In session 3, the subjects were pretreated for 4 days with rifampicin and received FLB with the last dose of rifampicin on day 5. Plasma and DBS samples were obtained between 0 and 8 h after FLB administration, and urine was collected during the 8 h after administration. The pharmacokinetic profiles of the drugs were comparable in DBS and plasma. FLB's apparent clearance values decreased by 35% in plasma and DBS during session 2 and increased by 75% in plasma and by 30% in DBS during session 3. Good correlations were observed between MRs calculated from urine, plasma, and DBS samples.
15094307	The metabolism of cyclamate to cyclohexylamine in humans during long-term administration. A group of 14 subjects, who had been identified from 261 volunteers in a 1-week screen as being able to metabolize the sweetener cyclamate to cyclohexylamine (>0.2% of a daily dose), and 31 nonconverters (<0.2% metabolism) were given calcium cyclamate tablets (equivalent to 250 mg cyclamic acid, 3 times daily) for a period of 13 weeks. The metabolism of cyclamate to cyclohexylamine was determined using twice-weekly timed (3 h) urine collections during week 1-3 and 7-13. Urine specimens were collected on all other study days to investigate day-to-day fluctuations in cyclohexylamine excretion. Analyses of the twice weekly timed urine collections showed that subjects recruited as nonconverters essentially remained nonconverters. Of the converters, three showed consistently low metabolism, five showed erratic metabolism, five showed low metabolism initially, which increased during the latter part of the study, and one subject showed consistently high metabolism throughout the study. Analysis of the day-to-day urine specimens showed marked intrasubject variability. The plasma concentrations of cyclohexylamine measured on weeks 1-3 and 7-13 reflected the urine profiles. The highest individual long-term average steady-state excretion values based on the 3-h urine collections and daily samples were 21%, 23%, 25%, 29%, 34%, and 38%. The maximum % metabolism detected in the high converters occasionally reached the value of 60% reported in previous short-term studies, but this high activity was not maintained, and was followed by periods of lower metabolism. The results of this metabolism study support an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0-11 mg/kg body weight per day.
23446989	In vitro metabolism of obovatol and its effect on cytochrome P450 enzyme activities in human liver microsomes. Obovatol, a major constituent of the leaves of Magnolia obovata Thunb, is known to inhibit nuclear factor-κB activity and arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation. This study was performed to identify the metabolites of obovatol in human liver microsomes. Human liver microsomes incubated with obovatol in the presence of NADPH and/or UDPGA resulted in the formation of six metabolites, M1-M6. M1 and M2 were identified as hydroxyobovatol, on the basis of liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) analysis. M1, M2 and obovatol were further metabolized to their glucuronide conjugates, obovatol-glucuronide (M3), obovatol-diglucuronide (M4) and hydroxyobovatol-glucuronide (M5 and M6). The inhibitory potency of obovatol on eight major human P450s was also investigated in human liver microsomes. In these experiments, obovatol strongly inhibited CYP2C19-mediated S-mephenytoin hydroxylase activity with an IC(50) value of 0.8 µM, which could have implications for drug-drug interactions.
15455178	Absorption and metabolism of genistein and its five isoflavone analogs in the human intestinal Caco-2 model. The purposes of this study were to determine the effect of structural change on the intestinal disposition of isoflavones and to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for transport of phase II isoflavone conjugates. Transport and metabolism of six isoflavones (i.e., genistein, daidzein, glycitein, formononetin, biochanin A, and prunetin) were studied in the human intestinal Caco-2 model and mature Caco-2 cell lysate. Glucuronides were the main metabolites in intact Caco-2 cells for all isoflavones except prunetin, which was mainly sulfated. In addition, the 7-hydroxy group was the main site for glucuronidation whereas the 4'-hydroxy group was only one of the possible sites for sulfation. Glucuronidated isoflavones (except biochanin A) were preferably excreted to the basolateral side, whereas sulfated metabolites (except genistein and glycitein) were mainly excreted into the apical side. Polarized excretion of most isoflavone conjugates was inhibited by the multidrug resistance-related protein (MRP) inhibitor leukotriene C(4) (0.1 micro M) and the organic anion transporter (OAT) inhibitor estrone sulfate (10 micro M). When formation and excretion rates of isoflavones were determined simultaneously, the results showed that formation served as the rate-limiting step for all isoflavone conjugates (both glucuronides and sulfates) except for genistein glucuronide, which had comparable excretion and formation rates. In conclusion, the intestinal disposition of isoflavones was structurally dependent, polarized, and mediated by MRP and OAT. Formation generally served as the rate-limiting step in the cellular excretion of conjugated isoflavones in the Caco-2 cell culture model.
21458546	Epigallocatechin-3-gallate does not affect the activity of enzymes involved in metabolic activation and cellular excretion of benzo[a]pyrene in human colon carcinoma cells. Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) and related procarcinogens found in cigarette smoke and roasted foodstuff require metabolic activation to build mutagenic DNA adducts that may cause tumor diseases like colorectal cancer. The major B[a]P-activating enzymes belong to the cytochrome-P450 (CYP)-1 family and are regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Previous studies have indicated that an inhibition of AhR is accompanied with a reduced metabolic activation of B[a]P and therefore may act protective against carcinogenesis. We investigated if the green tea flavonoid (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a known AhR inhibitor, is able to influence B[a]P-metabolizing and B[a]P-transporting enzymes in human Caco-2 colon carcinoma cells. Strikingly, treatment with EGCG did neither affect constitutive and B[a]P-inducible expression of CYP1A1 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)-1A1 nor overall CYP1 and UGT enzyme activities, indicating that EGCG does not antagonize the AhR in Caco-2 cells. Since flavonoids were also identified to enhance the activity of B[a]P-carrying transporter, we analyzed if EGCG exposure alters cellular excretion of B[a]P conjugates. In contrast to the positive control fisetin, EGCG did not affect cellular excretion of B[a]P metabolites. Our data provide evidence that EGCG does not alter the metabolism and transport of B[a]P in Caco-2 cells, and thus may not protect against procarcinogenic food contaminants.
18463198	Pathways of carbamazepine bioactivation in vitro. III. The role of human cytochrome P450 enzymes in the formation of 2,3-dihydroxycarbamazepine. Conversion of the carbamazepine metabolite 3-hydroxycarbamazepine (3-OHCBZ) to the catechol 2,3-dihydroxycarbamazepine (2,3-diOHCBZ) followed by subsequent oxidation to a reactive o-quinone species has been proposed as a possible bioactivation pathway in the pathogenesis of carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity. Initial in vitro phenotyping studies implicated CYP3A4 as a primary catalyst of 2,3-diOHCBZ formation: 2-hydroxylation of 3-OHCBZ correlated significantly (r(2) > or = 0.929, P < 0.001) with CYP3A4/5 activities in a panel of human liver microsomes (n = 14) and was markedly impaired by CYP3A inhibitors (>80%) but not by inhibitors of other cytochrome P450 enzymes (< or = 20%). However, in the presence of troleandomycin, the rate of 2,3-diOHCBZ formation correlated significantly with CYP2C19 activity (r(2) = 0.893, P < 0.001) in the panel of human liver microsomes. Studies with a panel of cDNA-expressed enzymes revealed that CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 were high (S50 = 30 microM) and low (S50 = 203 microM) affinity enzymes, respectively, for 2,3-diOHCBZ formation and suggested that CYP3A4, but not CYP2C19, might be inactivated by a metabolite formed from 3-OHCBZ. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that preincubation of 3-OHCBZ with human liver microsomes or recombinant CYP3A4 led to decreased CYP3A4 activity, which was both preincubation time- and concentration-dependent, but not inhibited by inclusion of glutathione or N-acetylcysteine. CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A7, CYP2C19, and CYP1A2 converted [14C]3-OHCBZ into protein-reactive metabolites, but CYP3A4 was the most catalytically active enzyme. The results of this study suggest that CYP3A4-dependent secondary oxidation of 3-OHCBZ represents a potential carbamazepine bioactivation pathway via formation of reactive metabolites capable of inactivating CYP3A4, potentially generating a neoantigen that may play a role in the etiology of carbamazepine-induced idiosyncratic toxicity.
23249383	In vitro biotransformation studies of 2-oxo-clopidogrel: multiple thiolactone ring-opening pathways further attenuate prodrug activation. The biotransformation of clopidogrel has been under extensive investigation to address the observed high clinical variability and resistance of its antithrombotic prodrug therapy. Clopidogrel (M0) is first activated to its thiolactone intermediate, 2-oxo-clopidogrel (M2), by hepatic cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes. Subsequent P450-catalyzed S-oxidation is followed by thioester hydrolysis, which cleaves the thiolactone ring and yields a sulfenic acid intermediate (M12); this intermediate is reduced to the final active metabolite (M13). The aim of the present study is to characterize the metabolic fates of M2 more comprehensively with focus on the thiolactone ring-opening pathways. It was found that the bioactivating S-oxidation confers on the thiolactone moiety not only one electrophilic site at the carbonyl C-atom (Site A), but also a second one at the allylic bridge C-atom (Site B). Both sites can react with H2O or other nucleophiles, like glutathione (GSH), leading to different thiolactone ring-opening pathways. In addition to the pharmacologically desired A-H2O pathway leading to M13 formation, the A-GSH pathway leads to the formation of a glutathione conjugate (GS-3), the B-H2O pathway leads to the formation of a desulfurized hydroxyl metabolite (M17), and the B-GSH pathway leads to the formation of a desulfurized glutathione conjugate (GS-2). These results demonstrate the reactive nature of the electrophilic thiolactone S-oxide intermediate (M11) and suggest that M13 formation from M2 might be accompanied by more attenuating pathways than previously reported. The research presented here may facilitate future studies exploring the clinical antithrombotic response to clopidogrel as well as the susceptibility to the adverse effect of clopidogrel and its close prodrug analogues.
8765473	Identification of CYP3A4 as the principal enzyme catalyzing mifepristone (RU 486) oxidation in human liver microsomes. Various complementary approaches were used to elucidate the major cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme responsible for mifepristone (RU 486) demethylation and hydroxylation in human liver microsomes: chemical and immunoinhibition of specific CYPs; correlation analyses between initial rates of mifepristone metabolism and relative immunodetectable CYP levels and rates of CYP marker substrate metabolism; and evaluation of metabolism by cDNA-expressed CYP3A4. Human liver microsomes catalyzed the demethylation of mifepristone with mean (+/-SD) apparent K(m) and Vmax values of 10.6 +/- 3.8 microM and 4920 +/- 1340 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively; the corresponding values for hydroxylation of the compound were 9.9 +/- 3.5 microM and 610 +/- 260 pmol/min/mg protein. Progesterone and midazolam (CYP3A4 substrates) inhibited metabolite formation by up to 77%. The CYP3A inhibitors gestodene, triacetyloleandomycin, and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol inhibited mifepristone demethylation and hydroxylation by 70-80%; antibodies to CYP3A4 inhibited these reactions by approximately 82 and 65%, respectively. In a bank of human liver microsomes from 14 donors, rates of mifepristone metabolism correlated significantly with relative immunodetectable CYP3A levels, rates of midazolam 1'-and 4-hydroxylation and rates of erythromycin N-demethylation, marker CYP3A catalytic activities (all r2 > or = 0.85 and P < 0.001). No significant correlations were observed for analyses with relative immunoreactive levels or marker catalytic activities of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP2E1. Recombinant CYP3A4 catalyzed mifepristone demethylation and hydroxylation with apparent K(m) values 7.4 and 4.1 microM, respectively. Collectively, these data clearly support CYP3A4 as the enzyme primarily responsible for mifepristone demethylation and hydroxylation in human liver microsomes.
20005211	Reductive activation of the prodrug 1,2-bis(methylsulfonyl)-1-(2-chloroethyl)-2-[[1-(4-nitrophenyl)ethoxy]carbonyl]hydrazine (KS119) selectively occurs in oxygen-deficient cells and overcomes O(6)-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase mediated KS119 tumor cell resistance. 1,2-Bis(methylsulfonyl)-1-(2-chloroethyl)-2-[[1-(4-nitrophenyl)ethoxy]carbonyl]hydrazine (KS119) is a prodrug of the 1,2-bis(sulfonyl)hydrazine class of antineoplastic agents designed to exploit the oxygen-deficient regions of cancerous tissue. Thus, under reductive conditions in hypoxic cells this agent decomposes to produce the reactive intermediate 1,2-bis(methylsulfonyl)-1-(2-chloroethyl)hydrazine (90CE), which in turn generates products that alkylate the O(6)-position of guanine in DNA. Comparison of the cytotoxicity of KS119 in cultured cells lacking O(6)-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) to an agent such as Onrigin, which through base catalyzed activation produces the same critical DNA G-C cross-link lesions by the generation of 90CE, indicates that KS119 is substantially more potent than Onrigin under conditions of oxygen deficiency, despite being incompletely activated. In cell lines expressing relatively large amounts of AGT, the design of the prodrug KS119, which requires intracellular activation by reductase enzymes to produce a cytotoxic effect, results in an ability to overcome resistance derived from the expression of AGT. This appears to derive from the ability of a small portion of the chloroethylating species produced by the activation of KS119 to slip through the cellular protection afforded by AGT to generate the few DNA G-C cross-links that are required for tumor cell lethality. The findings also demonstrate that activation of KS119 under oxygen-deficient conditions is ubiquitous, occurring in all of the cell lines tested thus far, suggesting that the enzymes required for reductive activation of this agent are widely distributed in many different tumor types.
21004	The gas chromatography mass spectrometry of the major metabolites of flurazepam. Mass spectra and gas chromatographic data are presented for flurazepam and its metabolites; monodesethylflurazepam, didesethylflurazepam, hydroxyethylflurazepam, N1-desalkylflurazepam, N1-desalkyl-3-hydroxy-flurazepam, and flurazepam-N1-acetic acid. The on-column thermal degradation of didesethylflurazepam, N1-desalkyl-3-hydroxyflurazepam and flurazepam-N1-acetic acid is reported and discussed. Mass spectrometric and gas chromatographic data are also presented for the benzophenones obtained by acid hydrolysis of flurazepam and its metabolites. The occurrence of flurazepam metabolites in urine from five forensic cases after various treatments has been investigated. A possible new 'metabolite' of flurazepam was detected in two of these cases.
23782585	Pharmacokinetics of vildagliptin in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. The kidney plays a key role in both the metabolism and excretion of vildagliptin. This study was designed to investigate the effects of varying degrees of renal impairment (RI) on the pharmacokinetics of vildagliptin. A total of 96 subjects were enrolled, and each subject received vildagliptin 50 mg dosed orally once daily for 14 days. Vildagliptin and metabolite concentrations in plasma and urine were measured on Days 1 and 14. Compared to age-, gender-, BMI-matched subjects with normal renal function, the mean AUC of vildagliptin after 14 days in patients with mild, moderate, and severe RI increased by 40%, 71%, and 100%, respectively, and the Cmax of vildagliptin showed similar and minimal increases of 37%, 32% and 36%, respectively. These pharmacokinetics results suggest that 50 mg once daily is an appropriate dose and recommended for patients with moderate and severe renal impairment.
6894619	Human metabolism of 7-substituted theophyllines: N3-demethylation and lack of oxidation of proxyphylline. Proxyphylline metabolism after oral administration to humans was studied. The only metabolic process detected was N3-demethylation, and 1-methyl-7-(2-hydroxypropyl)xanthine was isolated and identified. Proxyphylline was excreted in urine both an unchanged compound (12.7% of dose) and as its metabolic product (30.2% of dose). The latter substance was not found (detection limit = 1 microgram/ml) in the systemic circulation. Thus, it probably does not participate in the pharmacological activity of proxyphylline in vivo, although it was as active as the parent drug in relaxing the guinea pig tracheal chain. Lack of metabolism to uric acid derivatives is explained by the low affinity of both substances toward the enzymes the oxidize xanthine (xanthine oxidase) and methylxanthine derivatives. The presence of the metabolite in urine interferes with some analytical methods developed for estimation of unchanged proxyphylline. Published data on the urinary excretion of this drug need reevaluation.
21175440	The combined impact of CYP2C19 and CYP2B6 pharmacogenetics on cyclophosphamide bioactivation. The role of CYP pharmacogenetics in the bioactivation of cyclophosphamide is still controversial. Recent clinical studies have suggested a role for either CYP2C19 or CYP2B6. The aim of this study was to clarify the role of these pharmacogenes. We used a combined in vitro-in vivo approach to determine the role of these pharmacogenes in the bioactivation of the prodrug to 4-hydroxy cyclophosphamide (4-OHCP). Cyclophosphamide metabolism was determined in a human liver biobank (n= 14) and in patients receiving the drug for treatment of lupus nephritis (n= 16) In livers of known CYP2C19 and CYP2B6 genotype and protein expression we observed that there was a combined role for both CYP2C19 and CYP2B6 in the bioactivation of cyclophosphamide in vitro. The presence of at least one loss of function (LoF) allele at either CYP2C19 or CYP2B6 resulted in a significant decrease in both V(max) (P= 0.028) and CL(int) (P= 0.0017) compared with livers with no LoF alleles. This dual genotype relationship was also observed in a preliminary clinical study, with patients who had ≥1 LoF allele at either CYP2C19 or CYP2B6 also displaying significantly (P= 0.0316) lower bioactivation of cyclophosphamide. The mean 4-OHCP : CP bioactivation ratio was 0.0014 (95% CI 0.0007, 0.002) compared with 0.0071 (95% CI 0.0001, 0.014) in patients with no LoF alleles at either of these genes. The presence of ≥1 LoF allele(s) at either CYP2B6 or CYP2C19 appeared to result in decreased bioactivation of cyclophosphamide both in vitro and in patients. Further clinical studies to confirm this relationship are warranted.
21690265	Preclinical species and human disposition of PF-04971729, a selective inhibitor of the sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter 2 and clinical candidate for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. (1S,2S,3S,4R,5S)-5-[4-Chloro-3-(4-ethoxybenzyl)phenyl]-1-hydroxymethyl-6,8-dioxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2,3,4-triol (PF-04971729), a potent and selective inhibitor of the sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter 2, is currently in phase 2 trials for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. This article describes the preclinical species and in vitro human disposition characteristics of PF-04971729 that were used in experiments performed to support the first-in-human study. Plasma clearance was low in rats (4.04 ml · min(-1) · kg(-1)) and dogs (1.64 ml · min(-1) · kg(-1)), resulting in half-lives of 4.10 and 7.63 h, respectively. Moderate to good bioavailability in rats (69%) and dogs (94%) was observed after oral dosing. The in vitro biotransformation profile of PF-04971729 in liver microsomes and cryopreserved hepatocytes from rat, dog, and human was qualitatively similar; prominent metabolic pathways included monohydroxylation, O-deethylation, and glucuronidation. No human-specific metabolites of PF-04971729 were detected in in vitro studies. Reaction phenotyping studies using recombinant enzymes indicated a role of CYP3A4/3A5, CYP2D6, and UGT1A9/2B7 in the metabolism of PF-04971729. No competitive or time-dependent inhibition of the major human cytochrome P450 enzymes was discerned with PF-04971729. Inhibitory effects against the organic cation transporter 2-mediated uptake of [(14)C]metformin by PF-04971729 also were very weak (IC(50) = ∼900 μM). Single-species allometric scaling of rat pharmacokinetics of PF-04971729 was used to predict human clearance, distribution volume, and oral bioavailability. Human pharmacokinetic predictions were consistent with the potential for a low daily dose. First-in-human studies after oral administration indicated that the human pharmacokinetics/dose predictions for PF-04971729 were in the range that is likely to yield a favorable pharmacodynamic response.
20040581	Cross-species comparison of the metabolism and excretion of zoniporide: contribution of aldehyde oxidase to interspecies differences. Excretion and metabolism of zoniporide were investigated in humans after intravenous infusion of [(14)C]zoniporide at an 80-mg dose. Bile was the primary route of excretion because 57% of dose was recovered in the feces after intravenous infusion. Zoniporide was primarily cleared via metabolism in humans. 2-Oxozoniporide (M1) was the major excretory and circulating metabolite in humans and was catalyzed by aldehyde oxidase (K(m) of 3.4 microM and V(max) of 74 pmol/min/mg protein). Metabolites M2 (17% of the dose) and M3 (6.4% of circulating radioactivity), in which the guanidine moiety was hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid, were also detected in human feces and plasma, respectively, suggesting that hydrolysis was another route of metabolism of zoniporide in humans. The metabolism and excretion of [(14)C]zoniporide in rats and dogs were also evaluated. As in humans, bile was the primary route of excretion of the radiolabeled material in both species, and metabolism was the primary route of clearance. A comparison of plasma metabolites showed that for M3, rats had a higher concentration than human or dog. M1 was absent in dog and present in human and rat plasma at comparable levels, whereas comparison of excreta showed that the total body burden of M1 was greater in rat than that in human. No further evaluation of M2 was considered because it was detected only in the human fecal extracts. Hence, no further toxicological evaluation of the three human metabolites was undertaken.
20853460	An HPLC assay for the lipophilic camptothecin analog AR-67 carboxylate and lactone in human whole blood. AR-67 (7-t-butyldimethylsilyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin, DB-67) is a camptothecin analog currently in early stage clinical trials. The lactone moiety of camptothecins hydrolyzes readily in blood to yield the pharmacologically inactive carboxylate form. However the lactone form of third-generation lipophilic congeners, such as AR-67, is more stable, possibly due to partitioning into red cell membranes. This prompted us to develop a reverse-phase HPLC method with fluorescence detection (excitation 380 nm/emission 560 nm), which could quantitate the concentration of AR-67 lactone and carboxylate in whole blood. Samples were prepared by red cell lysis, protein precipitation with methanol and centrifugation to remove denatured materials. Recovery was estimated to be >85%. Analytes were eluted isocratically with 0.15 m ammonium acetate buffer containing 10 mm TBAP (pH 6.5) and acetonitrile (65:35, v/v) on a Nova-Pak C(18) column (4 µm; 3.9 × 150 mm). The assay was linear in the ranges 0.5-300 and 2.5-300 ng/mL for carboxylate and lactone, respectively. Accuracy and precision were acceptable. AR-67 forms were stable in whole blood and in methanolic supernatants. This assay has been successfully applied to measure AR-67 concentrations in whole blood of patients enrolled in a phase I study.
17230596	Oral-intravenous crossover study of fingolimod pharmacokinetics, lymphocyte responses and cardiac effects. The pharmacokinetics and lymphocyte responses to the immunomodulator fingolimod (FTY720) were characterized after oral and intravenous administration. In this randomized, two-period crossover study 11 evaluable healthy subjects received single doses of fingolimod 1.25 mg orally and 1 mg intravenously infused over 2 h. The pharmacokinetics of fingolimod, blood lymphocyte counts and heart rate were characterized for 28 days after each dose. After oral administration, Cmax was 1.1+/-0.2 ng/ml occurring at 12 h postdose and the AUC was 201+/-31 ng.h/ml. After intravenous infusion, Cmax was 4.9+/-0.8 ng/ml, AUC was 175+/-50 ng. h/ml, clearance was 6.3+/-2.3 l/h and distribution volume was 1199+/-260 l. The oral/intravenous ratio of dose-normalized AUCs was 0.94 (95%CI: 0.78-1.12). The pharmacologically active metabolite fingolimod-phosphate was quantifiable near its peak after oral administration but not after intravenous administration. The mean lymphocyte nadir occurred on day 1 and was 35% lower after oral (0.74x10(9)/l) than after intravenous (1.15x10(9)/l) administration. Lymphocytes recovered to the normal range by day 15 for both treatments. The mean heart rate nadir occurred 3-4 h postdose and was 11% lower after oral administration (47 bpm) versus intravenous administration (53 bpm). Average systemic exposure to fingolimod was similar after oral and intravenous administration. However, the acute decrease in lymphocyte counts was weaker after intravenous administration, likely because of lower blood levels of the active metabolite fingolimod-phosphate compared with oral administration.
12709315	Adverse effect of rifampin on quinine efficacy in uncomplicated falciparum malaria. The effects of adding rifampin to quinine were assessed in adults with uncomplicated falciparum malaria. Patients were randomized to receive oral quinine either alone (n = 30) or in combination with rifampin (n = 29). Although parasite clearance times were shorter in the quinine-rifampin-treated patients (mean +/- standard deviation, 70 +/- 21 versus 82 +/- 18 h; P = 0.023), recrudescence rates were five times higher (n = 15 of 23; 65%) than those obtained with quinine alone (n = 3 of 25; 12%), P < 0.001. Patients receiving rifampin had significantly greater conversion of quinine to 3-hydroxyquinine and consequently considerably lower concentrations of quinine in their plasma after the second day of treatment (median area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve from day zero to day 7 = 11.7 versus 47.5 micro g/ml. day, P < 0.001). Rifampin significantly increases the metabolic clearance of quinine and thereby reduces cure rates. Rifampin should not be combined with quinine for the treatment of malaria, and the doses of quinine should probably be increased in patients who are already receiving rifampin treatment.
1907291	Determination of glibenclamide and its two major metabolites in human serum and urine by column liquid chromatography. A simple reversed-phase liquid chromatographic method for the measurement of low concentrations of glibenclamide (glyburide) and its two major metabolites, 4-trans- and 3-cis-hydroxyglibenclamide, in human serum and urine has been developed. The compounds were extracted with n-hexane-dichloromethane (1:1). The UV detection wavelength was 203 nm. The minimum detectable serum level of glibenclamide was 1 ng ml (2 nM), and the relative standard deviation was 8.9% (n = 9). When maximum sensitivity was desired the metabolites were chromatographed separately. Metabolites in urine were measured by the same method after five-fold sample dilution. The utility of the method was tested on a healthy volunteer who ingested 3.5 mg of glibenclamide. The parent drug was present in the serum for at least 18 h, and the metabolites in the urine for at least 24 h.
4364176	Metabolism of penicillins to penicilloic acids and 6-aminopenicillanic acid in man and its significance in assessing penicillin absorption. Penicillins can be metabolized to penicilloic acids in man, the extent being dependent on the penicillin structure. In the phenoxy penicillin series, phenoxymethyl penicillin was found to be particularly unstable, but the higher homologues were more stable. In the isoxazolyl series, oxacillin was unstable, and progressive insertion of halogen in the phenyl ring increased stability. Ampicillin and amoxycillin showed some instability, ampicillin possibly being the more stable. After intramuscular administration, carbenicillin was very stable in the body, ampicillin was fairly stable, and benzyl penicillin was unstable. It is important to take into account the penicilloic acid content of urine when estimating total absorption of a penicillin. Increased stability in the body as well as slower renal clearance can lead to high concentrations in the serum. Penicilloic acids seemed to be more slowly cleared from the body than penicillins. The liver is probably the site of inactivation.
18768490	Plasma alkylresorcinols and urinary alkylresorcinol metabolites as biomarkers of cereal fiber intake in Finnish women. Alkylresorcinols (AR) could be good biomarkers of consumption of fiber-rich cereal products. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between plasma ARs or urinary AR metabolites and cereal fiber intake in women consuming their habitual diet. Twenty-five postmenopausal and 31 premenopausal women were recruited. The subjects included also vegetarians (n = 20) to obtain a broad range of cereal intake. Dietary intake, plasma ARs, and urinary AR metabolites [3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid and 3-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)-1-propanoic acid] were measured. Pearson's and Partial correlation tests were done between dietary fiber intake and plasma ARs or urinary AR metabolites. Cereal fiber intake correlated significantly with plasma AR C17:0 (r = 0.387), AR C19:0 (r = 0.350), AR C21:0 (r = 0.428), AR C23:0 (r = 0.409), AR C25:0 (r = 0.283), and total AR (r = 0.406) and with urinary AR metabolites DHBA (r = 0.359) and DHPPA (r = 0.402) even after adjustment for body mass index and age, which could be confounding variables. This is the first study to show a significant correlation between plasma ARs or urinary AR metabolites and cereal fiber intake during consumption of a habitual diet. These results indicate that assay of plasma ARs or urinary AR metabolites may be used as biomarkers in epidemiologic studies in free-living populations to evaluate the role of cereal fiber intake in various diseases.
8207937	Determination of S-benzyl-N-acetyl-L-cysteine by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry as a new marker of toluene exposure. We investigated by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry if S-benzyl-N-acetyl-L-cysteine (SBAC) is excreted into the urine of six printing workers and 20 sniffers after exposure to toluene. SBAC was extracted from 10 mL urine with chloroform and back extracted into 1M sodium bicarbonate. After acidfying, the sample was reextracted with ethyl acetate. The SBAC in urine was also measured by selected ion monitoring methods, using deuterium-labeled SBAC as an internal standard. An excellent linearity was obtained from 0.01 to 3.0 mg/L (r = 0.998). Urinary concentrations of SBAC were determined quantitatively in all samples from sniffers and printing workers (n = 26, 0.02-43.29 mg/L) but were not determined in the urine of persons not exposed to toluene (n = 40). The results of this experiment indicate that SBAC is excreted as a minor metabolite of toluene in human urine. The analysis of urinary SBAC is a useful tool in identifying toluene exposure.
16006566	A simple sequential incubation method for deconvoluting the complicated sequential metabolism of capravirine in humans. Capravirine, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1, undergoes extensive oxygenations to numerous sequential metabolites in humans. Because several possible oxygenation pathways may be involved in the formation and/or sequential metabolism of a single metabolite, it is very difficult or even impossible to determine the definitive pathways and their relative contributions to the overall metabolism of capravirine using conventional approaches. For this reason, a human liver microsome-based "sequential incubation" method has been developed to deconvolute the complicated sequential metabolism of capravirine. In brief, the method includes three fundamental steps: 1) 30-min primary incubation of [(14)C]capravirine, 2) isolation of (14)C metabolites from the primary incubate, and 3) 30-min sequential incubation of each isolated (14)C metabolite supplemented with an ongoing (30 min) microsomal incubation with nonlabeled capravirine. Based on the extent of both the disappearance of the isolated precursor (14)C metabolites and the formation of sequential (14)C metabolites, definitive oxygenation pathways of capravirine were assigned. In addition, the percentage contribution of a precursor metabolite to the formation of each of its sequential metabolites (called sequential contribution) and the percentage contribution of a sequential metabolite formed from each of its precursor metabolites (called precursor contribution) were determined. An advantage of this system is that the sequential metabolism of each isolated (14)C metabolite can be monitored selectively by radioactivity in the presence of all relevant metabolic components (i.e., nonlabeled parent and its other metabolites). This methodology should be applicable to mechanistic studies of other compounds involving complicated sequential metabolic reactions when radiolabeled materials are available.
19351112	Urinary excretion of the main anthocyanin in lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea), cyanidin 3-O-galactoside, and its metabolites. In vitro trials have indicated various potential health effects of lingonberries ( Vaccinium vitis-idaea L.). Most of these studies have been performed with berry extract or juice, and the detailed chemical structures of active compounds in these products have not been elucidated. Lingonberry contains cyanidin-3-galactoside as its main anthocyanin. Absorption and metabolism of the compound is not fully understood, and no studies of anthocyanin metabolism have been performed with lingonberries. The aim of this study was to investigate the urinary excretion of cyanidin-3-galactoside and its metabolites in young and healthy subjects receiving a breakfast containing 300 g of lingonberries. A fast, selective, and sensitive ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (uHPLC-MS/MS) method was optimized for the analysis of the anthocyanin metabolites in urine. Both intact cyanidin-3-galactoside and its methylated and glucuronidated metabolites were identified from urine samples. The two metabolites represented >50% of cyanidin excreted in urine. Maximal excretion appeared between 4 and 8 h after the meal. Also, the compounds were absorbed more slowly than reported previously in several studies.
20799690	National study of exposure to pesticides among professional applicators: an investigation based on urinary biomarkers. Epidemiologic studies of pesticides have been subject to important biases arising from exposure misclassification. Although turf applicators are exposed to a variety of pesticides, these exposures have not been well characterized. This paper describes a repeated measures study of 135 TruGreen applicators over three spraying seasons via the collection of 1028 urine samples. These applicators were employed in six cities across the United States. Twenty-four-hour estimates (μg) were calculated for the parent compounds 2,4-D, MCPA, mecoprop, dicamba, and imidacloprid and for the insecticide metabolites MPA and 6-CNA. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the urinary levels of these pesticides, whereas mixed models were applied to describe the variance apportionment with respect to city, season, individual, and day of sampling. The contributions to the overall variance explained by each of these factors varied considerably by the type of pesticide. The implications for characterizing exposures in these workers within the context of a cohort study are discussed.
12850404	Tissue distribution of trichloroethylene in a case of accidental acute intoxication by inhalation. This article describes the toxicological findings in a fatality due to an accidental inhalation of trichloroethylene which took place during wall coating of a poorly ventilated well using trichloroethylene. The man was wearing protective clothing and a mouthmask with adsorbent. He was found dead on the floor of the well 5h after descending. Trichloroethylene was added to the mortar to enhance drying. Identification and quantitation of trichloroethylene in the postmortem samples (blood, lung, liver, kidney, stomach content and bile) and identification of its metabolite trichloroacetic acid in urine was performed using static headspace gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detector. The compounds were separated on a CP-SIL 5CB Low Bleed/MS column using n-butanol as internal standard. The method was linear over the specific range investigated, and showed an accuracy of 104% and an intra-day precision of 11%. Trichloroethylene concentrations of 84mg/l in subclavian blood, 40mg/l in femoral blood, 72mg/kg in liver, 12mg/kg in kidney, 78mg/kg in stomach content, 104mg/l in bile and 21mg/kg in lung were found. Trichloroacetic acid was identified in the urine.
12668072	High-performance liquid chromatographic assay with fluorescence detection for the simultaneous measurement of carboxylate and lactone forms of irinotecan and three metabolites in human plasma. Irinotecan (CPT-11), a camptothecin analog, is metabolized to SN-38, an active topoisomerase I inhibitor, and inactive metabolites, including APC and SN-38 glucuronide (SN-38G). A high-performance liquid chromatographic assay method to simultaneously measure the lactone and carboxylate forms of CPT-11, SN-38, SN-38G, and APC in human plasma was developed. Chromatography was accomplished with a reversed-phase C(8) column and fluorescence detection. A gradient mobile phase system was used. The buffer for mobile phase A consisted of 0.75 M ammonium acetate, 5 mM tetrabutylammonium phosphate (pH 6.0), and acetonitrile (86:14, v/v). The buffer for mobile phase B was identical to mobile phase A with the exception of the concentration (50:50, v/v). Precipitation of plasma proteins was performed with cold methanol. The linear range of detection of the lactone and carboxylate forms of SN-38, SN-38G, and APC was 2-25 ng/ml, and 5-300 ng/ml for CPT-11. The limit of quantitation for the analytes ranged from 0.5 to 5 ng/ml. Analysis of patients' plasma samples obtained before and after CPT-11 administration showed that the assay is suitable for measuring lactone and carboxylate forms of CPT-11, SN-38, SN-38G, and APC in clinical studies.
17634961	Liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry method for the determination of the active metabolite M-1 of suplatast tosilate in human plasma. A liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC/ESIMS) method for the determination of 4-(3-ethoxy-2-hydroxypropoxy) acrylanilide (M-1), the active metabolite of suplatast tosilate, in human plasma was established. Plasma samples were extracted with diethyl ether, separated on a C(18) column with a mobile phase of acetonitrile-10 mm ammonium acetate solution containing 0.1% formic acid (28:72, v/v) and detected by ESIMS. The method was linear over the concentration range 0.15-60.0 ng/mL. The lowest limit of quantification was 0.15 ng/mL. The intra- and inter-run relative standard deviations obtained from three validation runs were all less than 8.6%, and the intra- and inter-run relative errors were all less than 3.1%. The method was successfully applied for the evaluation of pharmacokinetic profiles of M-1 in healthy volunteers.
18827074	Clinical pharmacokinetics of XP13512, a novel transported prodrug of gabapentin. Gabapentin absorption occurs in only a limited region of the small intestine and saturates at doses used clinically, resulting in dose-dependent pharmacokinetics, high interpatient variability, and potentially ineffective drug exposure. XP13512/GSK1838262 is a novel transported prodrug of gabapentin that is absorbed throughout the entire length of the intestine by high-capacity nutrient transporters. In 4 studies of healthy volunteers (136 subjects total), the pharmacokinetics of XP13512 immediate- and extended-release formulations were compared with those of oral gabapentin. XP13512 immediate-release (up to 2800 mg single dose and 2100 mg twice daily) was well absorbed (>68%, based on urinary recovery of gabapentin), converted rapidly to gabapentin, and provided dose-proportional exposure, whereas absorption of oral gabapentin declined with increasing doses to <27% at 1200 mg. Compared with 600 mg gabapentin, an equimolar XP13512 extended-release dose provided extended gabapentin exposure (time to maximum concentration, 8.4 vs 2.7 hours) and superior bioavailability (74.5% vs 36.6%). XP13512 may therefore provide more predictable gabapentin exposure and decreased dosing frequency.
16620544	Anesthesiologist suicide with atracurium. Atracurium is a nondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxant used to facilitate endotracheal intubation and to induce skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation. The drug undergoes a spontaneous non-enzymatic biotransformation, yielding laudanosine and an acrylate moiety. This report documents the case of a 45-year-old anesthesiologist who was found dead at the hospital where he worked. The victim was known to be depressed and undergoing treatment with venlafaxine. An empty syringe was found near the body. Toxicological analysis revealed the presence of laudanosine in the syringe, 0.6 mg/L of laudanosine in heart blood, 0.3 mg/L in urine, and 0.02 mg/L in vitreous humor. Meanwhile, concentrations of venlafaxine and O-desmethyl-venlafaxine, its active metabolite, were 0.7 and 1.1 mg/L in heart blood, 1.7 and 5.2 mg/L in urine, 0.5 and 0.7 mg/L in vitreous humor, and 400 and 20 mg in gastric content, respectively. All drugs and metabolites involved in the case were detected using gas chromatography with nitrogen-phosphorus detection (GC-NPD) and confirmed using GC-mass spectrometry in full scan mode after solid-phase extraction using Bond-Elut Certify columns. Additional high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to diode-array detection screening also obtained the same results. Quantitation of laudanosine and venlafaxine together with its metabolite was carried out using GC-NPD. No other drugs, including ethanol, were detected. Recoveries for laudanosine and venlafaxine were 89% and 86%, respectively, at 0.5 mg/L; intraday and interday precisions were 2% and 6%, and 3% and 7%, respectively; and limits of detection and quantitation were 6 and 20 ng/mL and 18 and 59 ng/mL, respectively. The linearity of the blood calibration curves was excellent for both drugs with r(2) values of > 0.999 (range 0.1-2.0 mg/L). Based on the autopsy findings, case history, and toxicology results, the forensic pathologists ruled that the cause of death was an overdose of atracurium, and the manner of death was suicide.
20103582	Metabolism-mediated drug interactions associated with ritonavir-boosted tipranavir in mice. Tipranavir (TPV) is the first nonpeptidic protease inhibitor used for the treatment of drug-resistant HIV infection. Clinically, TPV is coadministered with ritonavir (RTV) to boost blood concentrations and increase therapeutic efficacy. The mechanism of metabolism-mediated drug interactions associated with RTV-boosted TPV is not fully understood. In the current study, TPV metabolism was investigated in mice using a metabolomic approach. TPV and its metabolites were found in the feces of mice but not in the urine. Principal component analysis of the feces metabolome uncovered eight TPV metabolites, including three monohydroxylated, three desaturated, one dealkylated, and one dihydroxylated. In vitro study using human liver microsomes recapitulated five TPV metabolites, all of which were suppressed by RTV. CYP3A4 was identified as the primary enzyme contributing to the formation of four TPV metabolites (metabolites II, IV, V, and VI), including an unusual dealkylated product arising from carbon-carbon bond cleavage. Multiple cytochromes P450 (2C19, 2D6, and 3A4) contributed to the formation of a monohydroxylated metabolite (metabolite III). In vivo, RTV cotreatment significantly inhibited eight TPV metabolic pathways. In summary, metabolomic analysis revealed two known and six novel TPV metabolites in mice, all of which were suppressed by RTV. The current study provides solid evidence that the RTV-mediated boosting of TPV is due to the modulation of P450-dependent metabolism.
12670007	Fatal acute poisoning by bentazon. A case of fatal suicidal bentazon poisoning is presented along with a description of the different analytical methods involved. A 56-year-old farmer was examined by the family doctor 1 h after voluntarily ingesting 500 mL of FIGHTER (bentazon, 480 g/L water). He presented a Glasgow score of 15, polypnea, diarrhea, and vomiting. During transport by ambulance to the hospital, he tossed, sweated, and suddenly presented breathing difficulty followed by heart failure. Tracheal intubation was impossible (H1.5) despite use of different diameter cannulas because of extreme general muscle rigidity. All attempts at resuscitation failed, and the patient died within 2 h postingestion. Blood and urine samples were taken just before death. General basic and neutral drug screening by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode-array detection and gas chromatography-nitrogen-phosphorus detection showed no strychnine or other drugs or toxics except for citalopram (< 0.1 mg/L) and bentazon, but this weak acidic molecule (pKa3.3) was badly extracted in alkaline conditions. Plasma and urine levels, measured after acidic extraction, protein precipitation, or simple dilution, were 1500 and 1000 mg/L, respectively. Bentazon (M.W. 240) was confirmed by its basic mass spectrum (ESI-, m/z 239, 197, 175, 132) or by that of methylated derivative (El+, m/z 254, 212, 175). An hydroxylated metabolite (ESI-, m/z 255, 213, 191, 148; El+, m/z 284, 242, 163) and the N1-glucuronide conjugate of bentazon (ESI-, m/z 415, 239) were also detected in urine. (Quantitation ions are underlined.) This first case of bentazon poisoning with available analytical data revealed the high toxicity of this compound after large dose ingestion with early and heavy symptoms such as muscle rigidity probably related to muscular toxicity. Comparison with another nonfatal case and with toxicological data on animals is discussed.
23290298	Analysis of quazepam and its metabolites in human urine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry: application to a forensic case. A sensitive method for the simultaneous determination of quazepam and two of its metabolites, 2-oxoquazepam and 3-hydroxy-2-oxoquazepam, in human urine was developed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) with an Rtx-5MS capillary column. The quazepam and its metabolites were extracted from human urine using a simple solid-phase extraction Oasis(®) HLB cartridge column, and the 3-hydroxy-2-oxoquazepam was derivatised using BSTFA/1%TMCS and pyridine at 60 °C for 30 min. The mass spectrometric detection of the analytes was performed in the full scan mode, m/z 60-480, and selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode, m/z 386, for quazepam; m/z 342, for 2-oxoquazepam; m/z 429, for 3-hydroxy-2-oxoquazepam-TMS; and m/z 284, for alprazolam-d5 (internal standard), by electron ionization. The calibration curves of quazepam and its metabolites in urine showed good linearity in the concentration range of 2.5-500 ng/0.2 ml of urine. The average recoveries of quazepam and its metabolites from 0.2 ml of urine containing 500 ng and 50 ng of each drug were 71-83% and 88-90%, respectively. The limits of detection of quazepam, 2-oxoquazepam and 3-hydroxy-2-quazepam in urine by the selected ion monitoring mode were 0.096-0.37 ng/ml. This method would be applicable to other forensic biological materials containing low concentrations of quazepam and its metabolites.
20197485	Assessment of the effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetic profile of laninamivir, a novel neuraminidase inhibitor, after a single inhaled dose of its Prodrug, CS-8958. This open-label, single-dose study assessed the safety and pharmacokinetics of laninamivir, a new long-acting neuraminidase inhibitor, after an inhaled 20-mg dose of its prodrug, CS-8958, to a total of 20 subjects with normal, mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment. CS-8958 and laninamivir concentrations were measured in plasma and urine by validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry methods. The area under the concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC(0-inf)), maximum concentration (C(max)), and time to C(max) of CS-8958 did not change with the degree of renal impairment, whereas the half-life (t(1/2)) of CS-8958 increased with increasing renal insufficiency. The AUC(0-inf) and C(max) of laninamivir tended to increase along with the decrease of creatinine clearance. The AUC(0-inf) of laninamivir compared with normal subjects increased 1.10-, 2.03-, and 4.92-fold in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively, without changing t(1/2) among the subjects. Renal clearance of both CS-8958 and laninamivir was well correlated with creatinine clearance. These data indicate that the rate-limiting step for the elimination of laninamivir would not be the renal excretion rate but rather the drug release rate to plasma from the retained tissues. CS-8958 was well tolerated by all the subjects, although increasing renal dysfunction leads to increasing systemic exposure to laninamivir, particularly in severe renal insufficiency.
23108983	Simultaneous determination of sunitinib and its two metabolites in plasma of Chinese patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A simple and rapid liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of sunitinib and its two metabolites in plasma of Chinese patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). After simple one-step protein precipitation with methanol-acetonitrile (1:1, v/v), all three analytes were separated on an Agilent Zorbax SB-C(18) column using a gradient mobile phase consisting of water (0.1% formic acid)-acetonitrile (0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 0.50 mL/min. The detection was performed in multiple reaction monitoring mode, using the transitions of m/z 399.0 → 326.2, m/z 371.0 → 283.1, m/z 343.0 → 283.1 and m/z 386.3 → 122.2 for sunitinib, M1, M2 and buspirone, respectively. The method was linear over the range of 0.10-100 ng/mL for all three analytes using only 50 μL of plasma and the lower limit of quantifications for the three analytes were all 0.10 ng/mL. The intra-day and inter-day precisions were all less than 15% and the accuracies were within the range of ±15%; recoveries were between 85.0 and 115%. The validated method was successfully applied to an explorative pharmacokinetic study of sunitinib in Chinese patients with mRCC following multi-dose oral administration.
22554311	Kinetics and metabolism of fomepizole in healthy humans. Fomepizole, a potent inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase, has replaced ethanol as antidote for methanol and ethylene glycol intoxications because of a longer duration of action and fewer adverse effects. Prior human studies have indicated that single doses of fomepizole are eliminated by Michaelis-Menten kinetics, but two studies in poisoned patients have suggested that first order elimination occurs after multiple doses. Because of the contrast in fomepizole kinetics among existing studies and the lack of information regarding its metabolism in humans, kinetic and metabolic studies were conducted after single doses and after multiple oral doses in healthy human subjects. In a single-dose, crossover study, healthy humans received fomepizole IV or orally (7 mg/kg). Also to define the metabolism and kinetics of fomepizole when administered over the presumed antidotal period, subjects were divided into three groups, which were given oral loading doses of 10-15 mg/kg, followed by supplemental doses of 3-10 mg/kg/12 h through 96 hours. The single dose study confirmed that fomepizole was eliminated by saturable, nonlinear kinetics, primarily by metabolism, and subsequent renal excretion of the metabolite 4-carboxypyrazole (4-CP). In the multi-dose study, the zero order elimination rate of fomepizole increased with increasing duration of treatment (from mean of 3 μmol/L/h after first dose to 14 μmol/L/h after 72 hours). Consistent with the enhanced elimination of fomepizole, the rate of urinary excretion of 4-CP increased with time. After 96 hours, fomepizole elimination apparently changed to first order kinetics with a t(½) of 1.5-2 hours. The results suggest that fomepizole induces its own metabolism via cytochrome P-450, leading to enhanced fomepizole elimination and 4-CP excretion. Thus, to maintain relatively constant plasma levels of fomepizole during therapy, increased supplemental doses at about 36-48 hours are needed to overcome the increased elimination of fomepizole. As such, these kinetic evaluations in healthy humans support the current dosing recommendations for fomepizole.
21679150	In vitro metabolism of phenstatin: potential pharmacological consequences. Phenstatin and its derivatives are potential anticancer drug candidates according to their inhibitory properties on tubulin polymerization, cell growth and antivascular activity. However, at the present time, neither pharmacological nor metabolic studies have been conducted in order to strengthen the relevance of phenstatine as a drug discovery candidate. In the present work, the metabolic fate of phenstatin in rat and human microsomal preparations was studied to investigate the stability of this tubulin polymerization inhibitor and any effects of the metabolites on polymerization and on PC3 cancer cell proliferation. The metabolites were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography and, after their synthesis, characterized by simultaneous LC-DAD-UV and LC-ESI-MS analyses. Thus, eight metabolites were identified. The major biotransformation pathways are carbonyl reduction, O-methylation at C-3', O-methylation after aromatic hydroxylation at the position C-2' on phenyl B ring and O-demethylation on A ring. Four of the identified metabolites were as active or more active, than phenstatin in vitro. Moreover, the better stability of phenstatin versus CA-4 and the lack of quinone formation could justify the design of new analogues which could include various substituents on phenyl rings or linker group in order to modulate the metabolism of phenstatin toward even more active metabolites and so up-regulate the pharmacological activity.
16133532	Lack of effect of ketoconazole-mediated CYP3A inhibition on sorafenib clinical pharmacokinetics. Sorafenib is a novel, small-molecule anticancer compound that inhibits tumor cell proliferation by targeting Raf in the Raf/MEK/ERK signalling pathway, and inhibits angiogenesis by targeting tyrosine kinases such as vascular-endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). In vitro microsomal data indicate that sorafenib is metabolized by two pathways: phase I oxidation mediated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4; and phase II conjugation mediated by UGT1A9. Approximately 50% of an orally administered dose is recovered as unchanged drug in the feces, due to either biliary excretion or lack of absorption. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of CYP3A inhibition by ketoconazole on sorafenib pharmacokinetics. This was an open-label, non-randomized, 2-period, one-way crossover study in sixteen healthy male subjects. A single 50 mg dose of sorafenib was administered alone (period 1) and in combination with ketoconazole 400 mg once daily (period 2) (ketoconazole was given for 7 days, and a single 50 mg sorafenib dose was administered concomitantly on day 4). No clinically relevant change in pharmacokinetics of sorafenib and no clinically relevant adverse events or laboratory abnormalities were observed in this study upon co-administration of the two drugs. Plasma concentrations of the main CYP3A4 generated metabolite, sorafenib N-oxide, decreased considerably upon ketoconazole co-administration. This effect is in accordance with the in vitro finding that CYP3A4 is the primary enzyme for sorafenib N-oxide formation. Further, these data indicate that blocking sorafenib metabolism by the CYP3A4 pathway will not lead to an increase in sorafenib exposure. This is consistent with data from a clinical mass-balance study that showed 15% of the administered dose was eliminated by glucuronidation, compared to less than 5% eliminated as oxidative metabolites. Since there was no increase in sorafenib exposure following concomitant administration of the highly potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole with low dose sorafenib, it is postulated that higher therapeutic doses of sorafenib may be safely co-administered with ketoconazole, as well as with other inhibitors of CYP3A.
7395524	Metabolism of lidocaine in human liver in vitro. We have incubated the local anaesthetic drug lidocaine with microsomes from human adult livers. The metabolites deethylated lidocaine (MEGX) and aromatically hydroxylated lidocaine (3-hydroxylidocaine) were isolated by high performance liquid chromatography and quantitated by the liquid scintillation counting technique. The deethylation rate markedly exceeded the hydroxylation rate also at very low lidocaine concentrations. This pattern differs from that detected earlier with rat liver microsomes where aromatic hydroxylation is significant at low lidocaine concentrations, but it is similar to that in female guinea pig microsomes. These findings show the importance of performing this type of experiments also with human materials.
21651314	Asenapine pharmacokinetics in hepatic and renal impairment. The effects of hepatic or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of atypical antipsychotics are not well understood. Drug exposure may increase in patients with hepatic disease, owing to a reduction of certain metabolic enzymes. The objective of the present study was to study the effects of hepatic or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of asenapine and its N-desmethyl and N⁺-glucuronide metabolites. Two clinical studies were performed to assess exposure to asenapine, desmethylasenapine and asenapine N⁺-glucuronide in subjects with hepatic or renal impairment. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined from plasma concentration-time data, using standard noncompartmental methods. The pharmacokinetic variables that were studied included the maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and the time to reach the maximum plasma concentration (t(max)). Eligible subjects, from inpatient and outpatient clinics, were aged ≥18 years with a body mass index of ≥18 kg/m² and ≤32 kg/m². Sublingual asenapine (Saphris®) was administered as a single 5 mg dose. Thirty subjects participated in the hepatic impairment study (normal hepatic function, n = 8; mild hepatic impairment [Child-Pugh class A], n = 8; moderate hepatic impairment [Child-Pugh class B], n = 8; severe hepatic impairment [Child-Pugh class C], n = 6). Thirty-three subjects were enrolled in the renal impairment study (normal renal function, n = 9; mild renal impairment, n = 8; moderate renal impairment, n = 8; severe renal impairment, n = 8). Asenapine and N-desmethylasenapine exposures were unaltered in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, compared with healthy controls. Severe hepatic impairment was associated with increased area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC(∞)) values for total asenapine, N-desmethylasenapine and asenapine N⁺-glucuronide (5-, 3-, and 2-fold, respectively), with slight increases in the C(max) of asenapine but 3- and 2-fold decreases in the C(max) values for N-desmethylasenapine and asenapine N⁺-glucuronide, respectively, compared with healthy controls. The mean AUC(∞) of unbound asenapine was more than 7-fold higher in subjects with severe hepatic impairment than in healthy controls. Mild renal impairment was associated with slight elevations in the AUC(∞) of asenapine compared with healthy controls; alterations observed with moderate and severe renal impairment were marginal. N-desmethylasenapine exposure was only slightly altered by renal impairment. No correlations were observed between exposure and creatinine clearance. Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) was associated with pronounced increases in asenapine exposure, but significant increases were not seen with mild (Child-Pugh class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh class B) hepatic impairment, or with any degree of renal impairment. Asenapine is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment; no dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, or in patients with renal impairment.
12729644	Synthesis of water-soluble prodrugs of BMS-191011: a maxi-K channel opener targeted for post-stroke neuroprotection. A variety of water-soluble prodrugs of BMS-191011 was synthesized and evaluated for solution state stability and rate of conversion to BMS-191011 in rat and human plasma. The deoxycarnitine ester prodrug (11c) was selected for clinical evaluation based on its superior chemical stability, crystallinity and cleavage to BMS-191011 in human plasma.
15081870	Inhibition of carcinogen-bioactivating cytochrome P450 1 isoforms by amiloride derivatives. We examined the effects of amiloride derivatives, especially 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA), on the activity of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1 isoforms, known to metabolize carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), such as benzo(a)pyrene (BP), into mutagenic metabolites and whose cellular expression can be induced through interaction of PAHs with the arylhydrocarbon receptor. EIPA was found to cause a potent and dose-dependent inhibition of CYP1-related ethoxyresorufine O-deethylase (EROD) activity in both liver cells and microsomes. It also markedly reduced activity of human recombinant CYP1A1 enzyme through a competitive mechanism; activities of other human CYP1 isoforms, i.e. CYP1A2 and CYP1B1, were also decreased. However, EIPA did not affect BP-mediated induction of CYP1A1 mRNA and protein levels in rat liver cells, likely indicating that EIPA does not block activation of the arylhydrocarbon receptor by PAHs. Inhibition of CYP1 activity by EIPA was associated with a decreased metabolism of BP, a reduced formation of BP-derived DNA adducts and a diminished BP-induced apoptosis in liver cells. The present data suggest that amiloride derivatives, such as EIPA, may be useful for preventing toxicity of chemical carcinogens, such as PAHs, through inhibition of CYP1 enzyme activity.
21914964	Metabolism and pharmacokinetic studies of JPH203, an L-amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) selective compound. Many primary human tumors and tumor cell lines highly express human L-type amino acid transporter 1 (hLAT1); cancerous cells in vivo are strongly linked to LAT1 expression. Synthetic chemistry and in vitro screening efforts have afforded a variety of novel and highly hLAT1 selective compounds, such as JPH203 1. In a recent report, we demonstrated that 1 has potent in vitro and in vivo activity. JPH203 was intravenously administered to produce significant growth inhibition against HT-29 tumors transplanted in nude mice. The current work develops a robust LC/MS-MS method to monitor 1 and its major Phase II metabolite N-acetyl-JPH203 2 from biological samples. We have conducted in vitro and in vivo experiments and the major scientific findings are: i) the major route of biotransformation of 1 is Phase II metabolism to produce 2; ii) metabolite 2 is formed in various organs/tissues (i.e. blood, liver, kidney); and iii) as dogs, which are deficient in NAT genes, do not produce 2, the dog will not be an appropriate toxicological model to evaluate 1.
20501911	Metabolite formation kinetics and intrinsic clearance of phenacetin, tolbutamide, alprazolam, and midazolam in adenoviral cytochrome P450-transfected HepG2 cells and comparison with hepatocytes and in vivo. Cryopreserved human hepatocytes and other in vitro systems often underpredict in vivo intrinsic clearance (CL(int)). The aim of this study was to explore the potential utility of HepG2 cells transduced with adenovirus vectors expressing a single cytochrome P450 enzyme (Ad-CYP1A2, Ad-CYP2C9, or Ad-CYP3A4) for metabolic clearance predictions. The kinetics of metabolite formation from phenacetin, tolbutamide, and alprazolam and midazolam, selected as substrates probes for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, respectively, were characterized in this in vitro system. The magnitude of the K(m) or S(50) values observed in Ad-P450 cells was similar to those found in the literature for other human liver-derived systems. For each substrate, CL(int) (or CL(max)), values from Ad-P450 systems were scaled to human hepatocytes in primary culture using the relative activity factor (RAF) approach. Scaled Ad-P450 CL(int) values were approximately 3- to 6-fold higher (for phenacetin O-deethylation, tolbutamide 4-hydroxylation, and alprazolam 4-hydroxyaltion) or lower (midazolam 1'-hydroxylation) than those reported for human cryopreserved hepatocytes in suspension. Comparison with the in vivo data reveals that Ad-P450 cells provide a favorable prediction of CL(int) for the substrates studied (in a range of 20-200% in vivo observed CL(int)). This is an improvement compared with the consistent underpredictions (<10-50% in in vivo observed CL(int)) found in cryopreserved hepatocyte studies with the same substrates. These results suggest that the Ad-P450 cell is a promising in vitro system for clearance predictions of P450-metabolized drugs.
21142269	Effect of inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes 2D6 and 3A4 on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous oxycodone: a randomized, three-phase, crossover, placebo-controlled study. Oxycodone is a μ-opioid receptor agonist that is mainly metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Because CYP enzymes can be inhibited by other drugs, the pharmacokinetics of oxycodone are prone to drug interactions. The aim of this study was to determine whether inhibition of CYP2D6 alone by paroxetine or inhibition of both CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 by a combination of paroxetine and itraconazole alters the pharmacokinetics of and pharmacological response to intravenous oxycodone. We used a randomized, three-phase, crossover, placebo-controlled study design in 12 healthy subjects. The subjects were given 0.1  mg/kg of intravenous oxycodone after pre-treatments with placebo, paroxetine or a combination of paroxetine and itraconazole for 4 days. Plasma concentrations of oxycodone and its oxidative metabolites were measured over 48 hours, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters subsequently evaluated. The effect of paroxetine on the plasma concentrations of oxycodone was negligible. The combination of paroxetine and itraconazole prolonged the mean elimination half-life of oxycodone from 3.8 to 6.6 hours (p < 0.001), and increased the exposure to oxycodone 2-fold (p < 0.001). However, these changes were not reflected in pharmacological response. The results of this study indicate that there are no clinically relevant drug interactions with intravenous oxycodone and inhibitors of CYP2D6. If both oxidative metabolic pathways via CYP3A4 and 2D6 are inhibited the exposure to intravenous oxycodone increases substantially.
18372400	Disposition of lasofoxifene, a next-generation selective estrogen receptor modulator, in healthy male subjects. Disposition of lasofoxifene, a next-generation selective estrogen receptor modulator, was investigated in male volunteers after p.o. administration of a single 20-mg dose of [(14)C]lasofoxifene. Approximately 72% of the administered dose was recovered from the urine and feces, with majority of dose excreted in the feces, probably via bile. The absorption of lasofoxifene in humans was slow with T(max) values typically exceeding 6 h. The C(max) and area under plasma concentration-time profile from time 0 to the last quantifiable time point values of lasofoxifene were lower than those determined for total radioactivity, indicating presence of circulating metabolites. The primary clearance mechanisms for lasofoxifene in humans were direct conjugation (glucuronide and sulfate conjugates) and phase I oxidation, each accounting for about half of the metabolism. Several oxidative metabolites were identified by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. The primary phase I metabolites were the result of hydroxylations on the tetraline moiety and the phenyl rings attached to the tetraline, and oxidation on the pyrrolidine moiety. Considering the numerous metabolites seen in vivo, additional in vitro studies using human liver and intestinal microsomes, recombinant cytochromes P450 (P450s), and UDP glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) were performed. The turnover of lasofoxifene was very slow in liver microsomes, and only two metabolites were identified as two regioisomers of the catechol metabolite. The results from in vitro experiments with recombinant isoforms and P450 isoform-selective inhibitors suggested that the oxidative metabolism of lasofoxifene is catalyzed primarily by CYP3A and CYP2D6. In addition, its glucuronidation is catalyzed by UGTs that are expressed in both the liver (UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A6, and UGT1A9) and the intestine (UGT1A8 and UGT1A10).
18827075	Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of dabigatran etexilate, an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, are not affected by moderate hepatic impairment. The impact of moderate hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of dabigatran etexilate was evaluated in an open, parallel-group study. Healthy volunteers (n = 12) and patients with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification B; n = 12) received a single oral dose of 150 mg dabigatran etexilate. The mean values for area under the concentration-time curve, terminal half-life, and renal clearance of dabigatran were comparable between patients with hepatic impairment and healthy volunteers. Conversion of the dabigatran intermediate BIBR1087 to active dabigatran was slower in patients with hepatic impairment, indicating that the liver is partly involved in bioconversion of dabigatran etexilate. However, total drug exposure was comparable between groups; therefore, this observation is of no clinical relevance with respect to the anticoagulant activity of dabigatran. The extent of dabigatran glucuronidation was unchanged by liver disease; glucuronidation capacity was maintained in moderate liver disease. The activated partial thromboplastin time, ecarin clotting time, and thrombin time relationships were essentially identical in both groups. This study shows that moderate hepatic impairment does not affect the PK/PD or safety profile of dabigatran. Therefore, patients with moderate hepatic impairment can be given dabigatran etexilate without the need for dose adjustment.
19797605	Glutathione S-transferase catalyzed desulfonylation of a sulfonylfuropyridine. MRL-1, a cannabinoid receptor-1 inverse agonist, was a member of a lead candidate series for the treatment of obesity. In rats, MRL-1 is eliminated mainly via metabolism, followed by excretion of the metabolites into bile. The major metabolite M1, a glutathione conjugate of MRL-1, was isolated and characterized by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopic methods. The data suggest that the t-butylsulfonyl group at C-2 of furopyridine was displaced by the glutathionyl group. In vitro experiments using rat and monkey liver microsomes in the presence of reduced glutathione (GSH) showed that the formation of M1 was independent of NADPH and molecular oxygen, suggesting that this reaction was not mediated by an oxidative reaction and a glutathione S-transferase (GST) was likely involved in catalyzing this reaction. Furthermore, a rat hepatic GST was capable of catalyzing the conversion of MRL-1 to M1 in the presence of GSH. When a close analog of MRL-1, a p-chlorobenzenesulfonyl furopyridine derivative (MRL-2), was incubated with rat liver microsomes in the presence of GSH, p-chlorobenzene sulfinic acid (M2) was also identified as a product in addition to the expected M1. Based on these data, a mechanism is proposed involving direct nucleophilic addition of GSH to sulfonylfuropyridine, resulting in an unstable adduct that spontaneously decomposes to form M1 and M2.
19074528	Metabolism of (+)-1,4-dihydro-7-(trans-3-methoxy-4-methylamino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-4-oxo-1-(2-thiazolyl)-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid (voreloxin; formerly SNS-595), a novel replication-dependent DNA-damaging agent. (+)-1,4-Dihydro-7-(trans-3-methoxy-4-methylamino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-4-oxo-1-(2-thiazolyl)-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid (voreloxin; formerly SNS-595 or AG-7352) is currently under investigation for the treatment of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and acute myeloid leukemia. In vitro voreloxin undergoes minimal cytochrome P450 (P450) and UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)-mediated metabolism, and in vivo excretion of unchanged voreloxin as the major species is consistent with the slow rate of metabolism observed in vitro. The objective of the present study was to examine the cross-species metabolic profile of voreloxin and to identify and characterize the metabolites formed in rats. We also investigated baculovirus-expressed human P450s and UGTs to determine which isoforms participated in voreloxin metabolism. Incubations using human, monkey, and rat liver microsomes showed monkey and rat metabolism is similar to human. Voreloxin and metabolites collected from plasma, bile, and urine from rats administered radiolabeled voreloxin were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography, and their structures were elucidated by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Activity of metabolites was determined with authentic reference standards in cell-based cytotoxicity assays. The proposed structures of metabolites suggest that metabolic pathways for voreloxin include glucuronide conjugation, oxidation, N-dealkylation, and O-dealkylation.
22496396	Identification of the cytochrome P450 and other enzymes involved in the in vitro oxidative metabolism of a novel antidepressant, Lu AA21004. 1-[2-(2,4-Dimethyl-phenylsulfanyl)-phenyl]-piperazine (Lu AA21004) is a novel antidepressant that is currently in late-stage clinical development for major depressive disorder. In the present study, the metabolism of Lu AA21004 was investigated using human liver microsomes (HLM), human liver S9 fraction, and recombinant enzymes. Lu AA21004 was found in vitro to be oxidized to a 4-hydroxy-phenyl metabolite, a sulfoxide, an N-hydroxylated piperazine, and a benzylic alcohol, which was further oxidized to the corresponding benzoic acid [3-methyl-4-(2-piperazin-1-yl-phenysulfanyl)-benzoic acid (Lu AA34443)]. The formation of the 4-hydroxy-phenyl metabolite was catalyzed by CYP2D6 with some contribution from CYP2C9, whereas the formation of the sulfoxide was mediated by CYP3A4/5 and CYP2A6. CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 were the primary enzymes responsible for formation of the N-hydroxylated metabolite. The benzylic alcohol was formed by CYP2D6 only. The oxidation of the benzylic alcohol to the corresponding benzoic acid of Lu AA21004 was catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase, with some contribution from aldehyde oxidase. CYP2D6 was also capable of catalyzing the formation of the benzoic acid of Lu AA21004; however, its overall contribution to this pathway was negligible. Enzyme kinetic parameters revealed that the rate-limiting step in the formation of the benzoic acid from Lu AA21004 is the formation of the corresponding alcohol. Thus, the intrinsic clearance (V(max)/K(m)) in HLM for metabolism of Lu AA21004 to the benzylic alcohol was 1.13 × 10(-6) l · min(-1) · mg(-1), whereas the subsequent metabolism of the benzylic alcohol to the benzoic acid of Lu AA21004 is characterized by an intrinsic clearance (V(max)/K(m)) in S9 fraction of 922 × 10(-6) l · min(-1) · mg(-1).
15560889	In vitro metabolism of carbofuran by human, mouse, and rat cytochrome P450 and interactions with chlorpyrifos, testosterone, and estradiol. Carbofuran is a carbamate pesticide used in agricultural practice throughout the world. Its effect as a pesticide is due to its ability to inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity. Though carbofuran has a long history of use, there is little information available with respect to its metabolic fate and disposition in mammals. The present study was designed to investigate the comparative in vitro metabolism of carbofuran from human, rat, and mouse liver microsomes (HLM, RLM, MLM, respectively), and characterize the specific enzymes involved in such metabolism, with particular reference to human metabolism. Carbofuran is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) leading to the production of one major ring oxidation metabolite, 3-hydroxycarbofuran, and two minor metabolites. The affinity of carbofuran for CYP enzymes involved in the oxidation to 3-hydroxycarbofuran is significantly less in HLM (Km=1.950 mM) than in RLM (Km=0.210 mM), or MLM (Km=0.550 mM). Intrinsic clearance rate calculations indicate that HLM are 14-fold less efficient in the metabolism of carbofuran to 3-hydroxycarbofuran than RLM or MLM. A screen of 15 major human CYP isoforms for metabolic ability with respect to carbofuran metabolism demonstrated that CYP3A4 is the major isoform responsible for carbofuran oxidation in humans. CYP1A2 and 2C19 are much less active while other human CYP isoforms have minimal or no activity toward carbofuran. In contrast with the human isoforms, members of the CYP2C family in rats are likely to have a primary role in carbofuran metabolism. Normalization of HLM data with the average levels of each CYP in native HLM, indicates that carbofuran metabolism is primarily mediated by CYP3A4 (percent total normalized rate (% TNR)=77.5), although CYP1A2 and 2C19 play ancillary roles (% TNR=9.0 and 6.0, respectively). This is substantiated by the fact that ketoconazole, a specific inhibitor of CYP3A4, is an excellent inhibitor of 3-hydroxycarbofuran formation in HLM (IC50: 0.31 microM). Chlorpyrifos, an irreversible non-competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4, inhibits the formation of 3-hydroxycarbofuran in HLM (IC50: 39 microM). The use of phenotyped HLM demonstrated that individuals with high levels of CYP3A4 have the greatest potential to metabolize carbofuran to its major metabolite. The variation in carbofuran metabolism among 17 single-donor HLM samples is over 5-fold and the best correlation between CYP isoform activity and carbofuran metabolism was observed with CYP3A4 (r2=0.96). The interaction of carbofuran and the endogenous CYP3A4 substrates, testosterone and estradiol, were also investigated. Testosterone metabolism was activated by carbofuran in HLM and CYP3A4, however, less activation was observed for carbofuran metabolism by testosterone in HLM and CYP3A4. No interactions between carbofuran and estradiol metabolism were observed.
12527341	Metabolism of quercetin-7- and quercetin-3-glucuronides by an in vitro hepatic model: the role of human beta-glucuronidase, sulfotransferase, catechol-O-methyltransferase and multi-resistant protein 2 (MRP2) in flavonoid metabolism. Quercetin-3- and quercetin-7-glucuronides are major products of small intestine epithelial cell metabolism (J. Nutr. 130 (2000) 2765) but it is not known if quercetin glucuronides can be further processed in the liver or if they are excreted directly. Using the HepG2 hepatic cell model, we show that highly purified quercetin-7- and quercetin-3-glucuronides can follow two pathways of metabolism: (i) methylation of the catechol functional group of both quercetin glucuronides (44% of quercetin-7-glucuronide at a rate of 2.6 nmol/hr/10(6) cells, and 32% of quercetin-3-glucuronide at a rate of 1.9 nmol/hr/10(6) cells, over 48 hr) or (ii) hydrolysis of the glucuronide by endogenous beta-glucuronidase followed by sulfation to quercetin-3'-sulfate (7% of quercetin-7-glucuronide at a rate of 0.42 nmol/hr/10(6) cells and 10% of quercetin-3-glucuronide at a rate of 0.61 nmol/hr/10(6) cells, over 48 hr). In contrast, quercetin-4'-glucuronide was not metabolised, and interestingly this is not a major product of the small intestine absorption process. The conversion of the quercetin-7- and quercetin-3-glucuronide to the mono-sulfate conjugate shows intracellular deglucuronidation by beta-glucuronidase activity, allowing transient contact of the free aglycone with the cellular environment. Inhibition of methylation using a catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor shifted metabolism towards sulfation, as indicated by an increase in quercetin-3'-sulfate formation (increase in rate to 1.13 and 1.43 nmol/hr/10(6) cells for quercetin-7-glucuronide and quercetin-3-glucuronide, respectively). Efflux of quercetin metabolites from HepG2 cells (methylated glucuronide and sulfate conjugates) was not altered by verapamil, a p-glycoprotein inhibitor, but efflux was competitively inhibited by MK-571, a multidrug resistant protein inhibitor, indicating a role for multidrug resistant protein in the efflux of quercetin conjugates from HepG2 cells. These results show that HepG2 cells can absorb and turnover quercetin glucuronides and that human endogenous beta-glucuronidase activity could modulate the intracellular biological activities of dietary antioxidant flavonoids.
15712230	Development and validation of a liquid chromatographic/electrospray ionization mass spectrometric method for the quantitation of prazepam and its main metabolites in human plasma. A method was developed and fully validated for the quantitation of prazepam and its major metabolites, oxazepam and nordiazepam, in human plasma. Sample pretreatment was achieved by solid-phase extraction using Oasis HLB cartridges. The extracts were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with single-quadrupole mass spectrometry (MS) with an electrospray ionization interface. The MS system was operated in the selected ion monitoring mode. HPLC was performed isocratically on a reversed-phase XTerra MS C18 analytical column (150 x 3.0 mm i.d., particle size 5 microm). Diazepam was used as the internal standard for quantitation. The assay was linear over a concentration range of 5.0-1000 ng ml(-1) for all compounds analyzed. The limit of quantitation was 5 ng ml(-1) for all compounds. Quality control samples (5, 10, 300 and 1000 ng ml(-1)) in five replicates from three different runs of analysis demonstrated an intra-assay precision (CV) of < or = 9.1%, an inter-assay precision of < or = 6.0% and an overall accuracy (relative error) of < 4.6%. The method can be used to quantify prazepam and its metabolites in human plasma covering a variety of pharmacokinetic or bioequivalence studies.
14570771	Preclinical characterization of 2-[3-[3-[(5-ethyl-4'-fluoro-2-hydroxy[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)oxy]propoxy]-2-propylphenoxy]benzoic acid metabolism: in vitro species comparison and in vivo disposition in rats. Assessment of the pharmacokinetics of [14C]2-[3-[3-[(5-ethyl-4'-fluoro-2-hydroxy[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)oxy]propoxy]-2-propylphenoxy-]benzoic acid ([14C]LY293111), an experimental anti-cancer agent, suggested long-lived circulating metabolites in rats. In vivo metabolites of LY293111 were examined in plasma, bile, urine, and feces of Fischer 344 (F344) rats after oral administration of [14C]LY293111. Metabolites were profiled by high-performance liquid chromatography-radiochromatography, and identified by liquid chromatography (LC)/mass spectrometry and LC/NMR. The major in vivo metabolites of LY293111 identified in rats were phenolic (ether), acyl, and bisglucuronides of LY293111. Measurement of radioactivity in rat plasma confirmed that a fraction of LY293111-derived material was irreversibly bound to plasma protein and that this bound fraction increased over time. This was consistent with the observed disparity in half-lives between LY293111 and total radioactivity in rats and monkeys, and is likely due to covalent modification of proteins by the acyl glucuronide. In vitro metabolism of [14C]LY293111 in liver slices from CD-1 mice, F344 rats, rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys, and humans indicates that glucuronidation was the primary metabolic pathway in all species. The acyl glucuronide was the most prevalent radioactive peak (16% of total 14C) produced by F344 rat slices, whereas the ether glucuronide was the major metabolite in all other species (26-36% of total 14C). Several minor hydroxylated metabolites were detected in F344 rat slice extracts but were not observed in other species. The data presented suggest that covalent modification of proteins by LY293111 acyl glucuronide is possible in multiple species, although the relative reactivity of this metabolite appears to be low compared with those known to cause adverse drug reactions.
12519692	Metabolic fate of pitavastatin, a new inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase: human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzymes involved in lactonization. 1. Pitavastatin is a potent competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase little metabolized in hepatic microsomes. Pitavastatin lactone, which can be converted back to the unchanged form, is the major metabolite of pitavastatin in humans. To clarify the mechanism of the lactonization of pitavastatin and the metabolic properties of the lactone, we performed experiments in vitro. 2. On addition of UDP-glucuronic acid, human hepatic microsomes produced pitavastatin lactone and an unknown metabolite (UM-2). UM-2 was converted to its unchanged form by enzymatic hydrolysis and to a lactone form non-enzymatically. Using several human UGT-expressing microsomes, UGT1A3 and UGT2B7 were principally responsible for glucuronidation of pitavastatin leading to lactonization. 3. No marked difference in intrinsic clearance between pitavastatin and its lactone form was detected in human hepatic microsomes. 4. Pitavastatin lactone showed no inhibitory effects on CYP2C9- and CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of model substrates in contrast to other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. 5. The mechanism of pitavastatin lactone formation has been clarified, in that glucuronidation by UGT occurs first followed by lactonization via an elimination reaction. It was also found that pitavastatin lactone demonstrates no drug-drug interactions.
11133003	CYP3A is responsible for N-dealkylation of haloperidol and bromperidol and oxidation of their reduced forms by human liver microsomes. We studied the biotransformation of haloperidol, bromperidol and their reduced forms by human liver microsomes. Nifedipine oxidation (CYP3A) activity correlated significantly with N-dealkylation rates of haloperidol and bromperidol and oxidation rates of their reduced forms, while neither ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation (CYP1A2) activity nor dextromethorphan O-deethylation (CYP2D6) activity did. In chemical and immunoinhibition studies, only troleandomycin and anti-CYP3A4 serum inhibited both formation rates of 4-fluorobenzoylpropionic acid, a metabolite of haloperidol and bromperidol, and back oxidation rates. Among 10 recombinant isoforms examined, only CYP3A4 showed catalytic activity. The Vmax and Km values of N-dealkylation of bromperidol and reoxidation of reduced bromperidol were similar to those of haloperidol and reduced haloperidol, respectively. The present study indicates that CYP3A plays a major role in N-dealkylation of and oxidation back to bromperidol as well as haloperidol and suggests that modification of in vivo CYP3A activity by inhibition or induction may affect the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic effects of haloperidol and bromperidol.
19576871	Bioactivation of coumarin in rat olfactory mucosal microsomes: Detection of protein covalent binding and identification of reactive intermediates through analysis of glutathione adducts. The presence of high levels, as well as tissue-specific forms, of cytochrome P450 enzymes in mammalian olfactory mucosa (OM) has important implications in the bioactivation and toxicity of xenobiotics entering the tissue. Previous studies have shown that coumarin, a known olfactory toxicant in rats, is bioactivated by OM microsomal P450s to a number of products, presumably via coumarin-3,4-epoxide and other epoxide intermediates. The aim of the current study was to obtain direct evidence for the formation of such reactive intermediates in rat OM through the detection of protein covalent binding and glutathione (GSH) adduct formation. Protein covalent binding experiments with [(14)C]coumarin (10microM) displayed a 7-9-fold higher NADPH-dependent radioactivity binding in rat OM microsomes (2.5nmol/mg/30min) compared to those in rat and human liver microsomes; the binding value in rat OM microsomes was substantially but not completely reduced by the addition of GSH (5mM). LC/MS analyses detected a number of GSH adducts in GSH-supplemented coumarin metabolism reaction in rat OM microsomes; 3-glutathionyl coumarin was found to be the major one, indicating 3,4-epoxidation as the main bioactivation pathway. Additional GSH adducts were identified, presumably forming via the same pathway or epoxidation on the benzene moiety. Our findings provide direct evidence for the formation of multiple coumarin reactive intermediates in rat OM, leading to protein covalent binding and GSH conjugation.
20382753	Cytochrome P450-mediated bioactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor erlotinib to a reactive electrophile. The epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib (ERL) is approved for treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer. Numerous reports of ERL-associated toxicities are consistent with immune-mediated toxicity, including drug-induced hepatitis, interstitial lung disease, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Although the mechanism of toxicity has not been established, we present evidence that reactive intermediates are formed during the metabolism of ERL, which can covalently conjugate to the cysteine group of the peptide-mimetic GSH. Seven ERL-GSH conjugates were identified in incubations with hepatic microsomes. Cytochrome P450 (P450)-dependent adducts are proposed to be formed via reactive epoxide and electrophilic quinone-imine intermediates. In incubations of human liver microsomes, intestinal microsomes, pulmonary microsomes, and recombinant P450s, CYP3A4 was the primary enzyme responsible for the bioactivation of ERL; however, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP3A5, and CYP2D6 were capable of catalyzing the bioactivation as well. During the metabolism of ERL, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 are irreversibly inactivated by ERL in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Inactivation was not dependent on oxidation of the ERL alkyne group to form a reactive oxirene or ketene, as shown by synthesizing analogs where the alkyne was replaced with a cyano group. CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP2D6 were not inactivated despite catalyzing the formation of ERL-GSH adducts.
18559562	Association between GST genetic polymorphism and dose-related production of urinary benzene metabolite markers, trans, trans-muconic acid and S-phenylmercapturic acid. The urinary benzene metabolites, trans, trans-muconic acid (ttMA) and S-phenylmercapturic acid (SPMA), are widely used as benzene exposure biomarkers. The influence of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) genetic polymorphism on the excretion levels of urinary ttMA and/or SPMA has been investigated. The association between dose-related production of urinary benzene metabolites and benzene exposure level was also reported. However, the association between the dose-related productions of urinary benzene metabolites and GST genetic polymorphism was not described in the literature. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between the GST genetic polymorphism and dose-related production of the two widely used biomarkers, urinary ttMA and SPMA. Seventy male workers in a chemical factory were measured for their benzene exposure levels and provided blood and urine specimens at the end of work-shift. The atmospheric benzene exposure levels of these workers were determined by passive samplers with gas chromatograph mass spectrometer. The urinary ttMA and SPMA levels were quantitated by an online dual-loop cleanup device with an electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometer. The analyses of GST genotypes, including M(1), T(1), and P(1), were done using PCR. Mean (+/- SD) of benzene exposure levels in participants was 7.2 +/- 15 ppm. The ttMA and SPMA levels in the high benzene exposure group (> or =1 ppm) were higher than those in the low benzene exposure group (<1 ppm; P < 0.001). Among the GST genotypes investigated in this study, the results showed that only the GSTT1 genotype was related to the level and dose-related production of SPMA. Using SPMA for evaluating benzene exposure, the results suggest that the GSTT1 genetic polymorphism, especially in a comparison study between two populations with different GSTT1 genotype frequencies, should be considered. Additionally, the biological exposure index value of SPMA should be set based on the levels of subjects with GSTT1-deficient genotypes for protection of all subjects.
16190932	A pilot study on brain-to-plasma partition of 10,11-dyhydro-10-hydroxy-5H-dibenzo(b,f)azepine-5-carboxamide and MDR1 brain expression in epilepsy patients not responding to oxcarbazepine. We measured the brain-to-plasma partition of 10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxy-5H-dibenzo(b,f)azepine-5-carboxamide (10-OHCBZ) in epilepsy patients undergoing surgery to alleviate drug-resistant seizures and administered with different oral doses of oxcarbazepine (OXC). We addressed the possible contribution of the multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp or MDR1) in determining 10-OHCBZ brain levels by measuring whether this active metabolite is a substrate of P-gp and the relation between the level of expression of MDR1 and the drug concentration in the same brain tissue specimens. Steady-state plasma and brain concentrations (C(ss)) of 10-OHCBZ were determined intraoperatively in 11 patients by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection. The level of expression of MDR1 mRNA was measured in surgically resected brain tissue by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The ability of 10-OHCBZ to act as substate of P-gp was evaluated by measuring its uptake in cell lines expressing different levels of P-gp, in the presence or absence of a selective P-gp inhibitor. OXC was converted to 10-OHCBZ and to Di-OHCBZ, the two main metabolites measured in plasma. The brain concentrations of the active metabolite 10-OHCBZ did not reflect plasma C(ss). A significant inverse linear correlation was found between 10-OHCBZ brain-to-plasma concentration ratio and the level of brain expression of MDR1 mRNA. In vitro uptake studies demonstrated lower intracellular 10-OHCBZ levels in cells with higher P-gp expression. Intracellular drug concentration was increased by XR9576, a specific P-gp blocker. Pharmacologic failure of OXC in pharmacoresistant epilepsy is unlikely to be due to alterations in drug metabolism. 10-OHCBZ does not appear to cross the blood-brain barrier by simple diffusion, and it acts as a substrate of P-gp. The level of expression of MDR1 is inversely correlated with 10-OHCBZ concentration in the epileptic tissue. P-gp may play a role in the pharmacoresistance to OXC by determining the attainment of insufficient concentrations of its active metabolite at neuronal targets.
22022868	Gender effects on rat metabolism of AMG 900, an orally available small molecule aurora kinase inhibitor. AMG 900 is an orally available small molecule that is highly potent and selective as a pan-aurora kinase inhibitor. AMG 900 is currently undergoing phase 1 clinical evaluation in patients with advanced solid tumors. The metabolism of AMG 900 was investigated in both male and female rats. We conducted studies in bile-duct catheterized (BDC) rats where bile, urine and plasma were analyzed to obtain metabolism profiles for each gender. These studies identified gender differences in the metabolism profiles in bile. Bile contained the majority of the drug related material and contained little unchanged AMG 900 which indicated that metabolism was the prominent process in drug elimination. Although bile contained the same metabolites for both genders, the amount of specific metabolites differed. Male rats metabolized AMG 900 primarily through hydroxylation with subsequent sulfate conjugation on the pyrimidinyl-pyridine side-chain whereas female rats favored a different oxidation site on the thiophene ring's methyl group, which is then metabolized to a carboxylic acid with subsequent conjugation to an acyl glucuronide. CYP phenotyping identified the prominent isoforms as being gender specific or biased in the oxidative metabolism of AMG 900. The metabolism in male rats favored both CYP2C11 and CYP2A2 whereas females favored the CYP2C12. The prominent sulfate conjugate identified in the male rat bile could also be due to male biased metabolism since it has been reported that sulfate conjugation is more prevalent in male rats. All the prominent rat metabolism routes for AMG 900 either have male or female bias. These differences in the rat AMG 900 metabolism profiles in bile can be explained by gender specific P450CYP isoforms.
22406105	In vitro enantioselective metabolism of TJ0711 hydrochloride by human liver microsomes using a novel chiral liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. A novel liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method employing chiral analytical techniques was developed and validated for in vitro enantioselective metabolic stability study of racemic 1-[4-(2-methoxyethyl) phenoxy]-3-[[2-(2-methoxyphenoxy) ethyl]amino]-2-propanol hydrochloride (TJ0711 HCl), a newly developed vasodilatory β-blocker. Robust enantiomeric separations were achieved on a chiral SUMICHIRAL OA-2500 column using ethanol and hexane (40:60, v/v) as a mobile phase. Metabolic stability results demonstrated that both TJ0711 enantiomers underwent a rapid phase I metabolism, but preferential metabolism of R-TJ0711 was observed. Our previously reported ultra-performance liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring-information dependent acquisition-enhanced product ion (UPLC-MRM-IDA-EPI) method was finally chosen for metabolite profiling study of TJ0711 enantiomers, because the newly developed HPLC-based method resulted in compromised chromatographic separation, particularly for TJ0711 metabolites. A number of metabolic products were detected and the structures of formed metabolites were predicted. Similar to racemic TJ0711 HCl, demethylation and hydroxylation were proposed to be the principle metabolism pathways during in vitro incubations of each enantiomer with human liver microsomes.
15135087	In vitro metabolism of fipronil by human and rat cytochrome P450 and its interactions with testosterone and diazepam. Fipronil (5-amino-1-[2,6-dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-4-[(trifluoromethyl)sulfinyl]-1H-pyrazole-3-carbonitrile) is a highly active, broad spectrum insecticide from the phenyl pyrazole family, which targets the gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) receptor. Although fipronil is presently widely used as an insecticide and acaricide, little information is available with respect to its metabolic fate and disposition in mammals. This study was designed to investigate the in vitro human metabolism of fipronil and to examine possible metabolic interactions that fipronil may have with other substrates. Fipronil was incubated with human liver microsomes (HLM) and several recombinant cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms obtained from BD Biosciences. HPLC was used for metabolite identification and quantification. Fipronil sulfone was the predominant metabolite via CYP oxidation. The K(m) and V(max) values for human liver microsomes are 27.2 microM and 0.11 nmol/mg proteinmin, respectively; for rat liver microsomes (RLM) the K(m) and V(max) are 19.9 microM and 0.39 nmol/mg proteinmin, respectively. CYP3A4 is the major isoform responsible for fipronil oxidation in humans while CYP2C19 is considerably less active. Other human CYP isoforms have minimal or no activity toward fipronil. Co-expression of cytochrome b(5) (b(5)) is essential for CYP3A4 to manifest high activity toward fipronil. Ketoconazole, a specific inhibitor of CYP3A4, inhibits 78% of the HLM activity toward fipronil at a concentration of 2 microM. Oxidative activity toward fipronil in 19 single-donor HLMs correlated well with their ability to oxidize testosterone. The interactions of fipronil and other CYP3A4 substrates, such as testosterone and diazepam, were also investigated. Fipronil metabolism was activated by testosterone in HLM but not in CYP3A4 Supersomes. Testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation in HLM was inhibited by fipronil. Fipronil inhibited diazepam demethylation but had little effect on diazepam hydroxylation. The results suggest that fipronil has the potential to interact with a wide range of xenobiotics or endogenous chemicals that are CYP3A4 substrates and that fipronil may be a useful substrate for the characterization of CYP3A4 in HLM.
1874880	Determination of benperidol and its reduced metabolite in human plasma by high-performance liquid chromatography and electrochemical detection. An isocratic high-performance liquid chromatographic method with electrochemical detection for the quantification of benperidol and its suggested reduced metabolite TVX Q 5402 in human plasma is described. The method included a two-step solid-phase extraction on reversed-phase and cation-exchange material, followed by separation on a cyanopropyl silica gel column (5 microns; 250 mm x 4.6 mm I.D.). The eluent was 0.15 M acetate buffer (pH 4.7) containing 25% acetonitrile (w/w). Spiperone served as internal standard. The inclusion of the cation-exchange step provided sample purity higher than those achieved with other methods. After extraction of 1 ml of plasma, concentrations as low as 0.5 ng/ml were detectable for both benperidol and the metabolite. In plasma samples collected from a schizophrenic patient treated with a single oral dose of 6 mg of benperidol, plasma levels of benperidol and of the metabolite could be measured from 20 min to at least 12 h after administration.
21087116	Metabolism of α-thujone in human hepatic preparations in vitro. This study aims to characterize the metabolism of α-thujone in human liver preparations in vitro and to identify the role of cytochrome P450 (CYP) and possibly other enzymes catalyzing α-thujone biotransformations. With a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method developed for measuring α-thujone and four potential metabolites, it was demonstrated that human liver microsomes produced two major (7- and 4-hydroxy-thujone) and two minor (2-hydroxy-thujone and carvacrol) metabolites. Glutathione and cysteine conjugates were detected in human liver homogenates, but not quantified. No glucuronide or sulphate conjugates were detected. Major hydroxylations accounted for more than 90% of the primary microsomal metabolism of α-thujone. Screening of α-thujone metabolism with CYP recombinant enzymes indicated that CYP2A6 was principally responsible for the major 7- and 4-hydroxylation reactions, although CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 participated to a lesser extent and CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 catalyzed minor 2-hydroxylation. Based on the intrinsic efficiencies of different recombinant CYP enzymes and average abundances of these enzymes in human liver microsomes, CYP2A6 was calculated to be the most active enzyme in human liver microsomes, responsible for 70-80% of the metabolism on average. Inhibition screening indicated that α-thujone inhibited both CYP2A6 and CYP2B6, with 50% inhibitory concentration values of 15.4 and 17.5 µM, respectively.
7957532	Esmolol, an ultrashort-acting, selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist: pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. The effects of esmolol at different rates of infusion (100, 250 and 500 micrograms.kg-1 BW.min-1) were compared with beta-adrenoceptor occupancy (beta 1 and beta 2, estimated by a subtype selective radioreceptor assay) and plasma concentrations of esmolol and its acid metabolite were measured by HPLC. Up to a rate of infusion of esmolol of 500 micrograms.kg-1 BW.min-1 there was a maximal beta 1-receptor occupancy of 84.7% while beta 2-receptor occupancy was below the detection limit; confirming the beta 1 selectivity of esmolol. Exercise-induced increases in heart rate and systolic blood pressure were reduced by esmolol in a dose-dependent manner. The estimated EC50 values of rate of infusion for the reduction in heart rate and systolic blood pressure during exercise were 113 and 134 micrograms.kg-1 BW.min-1, respectively. Additionally, heart rate and systolic blood pressure were reduced moderately at rest. Because of the short elimination half-life of esmolol caused by the rapid hydrolysis to its acid metabolite, 45 min after end of infusion high plasma concentrations of the metabolite (maximally 80 micrograms.ml-1) but no esmolol were detectable. Since no in vivo effects have been observed, despite the presence of high plasma concentrations of the metabolite, the metabolite did not participate in the observed effects up to an infusion rate of esmolol of 500 micrograms.kg-1 BW.min-1. The plasma concentrations of antagonist detected by radioreceptor assay and plasma concentrations of esmolol detected by HPLC showed a good correlation (r = 0.97).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
15257612	Oxidation of raloxifene to quinoids: potential toxic pathways via a diquinone methide and o-quinones. Raloxifene was approved in 1997 by the FDA for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, and it is currently in clinical trials for the chemoprevention of breast cancer. Before widespread use as a chemopreventive agent in healthy women, the potential cytotoxic mechanisms of raloxifene should be investigated. In the current study, raloxifene was incubated with GSH and either rat or human liver microsomes, and the metabolites and GSH conjugates were characterized using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Raloxifene was converted to raloxifene diquinone methide GSH conjugates, raloxifene o-quinone GSH conjugates, and raloxifene catechols. For comparison, three raloxifene catechols were synthesized and characterized. In particular, 7-hydroxyraloxifene was found to oxidize to the 6,7-o-quinone. As compared with raloxifene diquinone methide, which has a half-life of less than 1 s in phosphate buffer, the half-life of raloxifene 6,7-o-quinone was much longer at t(1/2) = 69 +/- 2.5 min. The stability offered by raloxifene 6,7-o-quinone implies that it may be more toxic than raloxifene diquinone methide. Cytotoxicity studies in the human breast cancer cell lines S30 and MDA-MB-231 showed that 7-hydroxyraloxifene was more toxic than raloxifene in both cell lines. These results suggest that raloxifene could be metabolized to electrophilic and redox active quinoids, which have the potential to cause toxicity in vivo.
18288793	Discovery of brivanib alaninate ((S)-((R)-1-(4-(4-fluoro-2-methyl-1H-indol-5-yloxy)-5-methylpyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-6-yloxy)propan-2-yl)2-aminopropanoate), a novel prodrug of dual vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 and fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 kinase inhibitor (BMS-540215). A series of amino acid ester prodrugs of the dual VEGFR-2/FGFR-1 kinase inhibitor 1 (BMS-540215) was prepared in an effort to improve the aqueous solubility and oral bioavailability of the parent compound. These prodrugs were evaluated for their ability to liberate parent drug 1 in in vitro and in vivo systems. The l-alanine prodrug 8 (also known as brivanib alaninate/BMS-582664) was selected as a development candidate and is presently in phase II clinical trials.
12207631	Enantioselective distribution of albendazole metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with neurocysticercosis. Albendazole (ABZ) is effective in the treatment of neurocysticercosis. ABZ undergoes extensive metabolism to (+) and (-)-albendazole sulphoxide (ASOX), which are further metabolized to albendazole sulphone (ASON). We have investigated the distribution of (+)-ASOX (-)-ASOX, and ASON in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with neurocysticercosis. Twelve patients with a diagnosis of active brain parenchymal neurocysticercosis treated with albendazole for 8 days (15 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) were investigated. On day 8, serial blood samples were collected during the dose interval (0-12 h) and one CSF sample was taken from each patient by lumbar puncture at different time points up to 12 h after the last albendazole dose. Albendazole metabolites were determined in CSF and plasma samples by h.p.l.c. using a Chiralpak AD column and fluorescence detection. Population curves for CSF albendazole metabolite concentration vs time were constructed. The mean plasma/CSF ratios were 2.6 (95% CI: 1.9, 3.3) for (+)-ASOX and 2.7 (95% CI: 1.8, 3.7) for (-)-ASOX, with the two-tailed P value of 0.9873 being non-significant. These data indicate that the transport of ASOX through the blood-brain barrier is not enantioselective, but rather depends on passive diffusion. The present results suggest the accumulation of the (+)-ASOX metabolite in the CSF of patients with neurocysticercosis. The CSF AUC(+)/AUC(-) ratio was 3.4 for patients receiving albendazole every 12 h. The elimination half-life of both ASOX enantiomers in CSF was 2.5 h. ASOX was the predominant metabolite in the CSF compared with ASON; the CSF AUC(ASOX)/AUC(ASON) ratio was approximately 20 and the elimination half-life of ASON in CSF was 2.6 h. We have demonstrated accumulation of the (+)-ASOX metabolite in CSF, which was about three times greater than the (-) antipode. ASOX concentrations were approximately 20 times higher than those observed for the ASON metabolite.
19251818	Pharmacokinetics of the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor saxagliptin in rats, dogs, and monkeys and clinical projections. Saxagliptin is a potent, selective, reversible dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitor specifically designed for extended inhibition of the DPP4 enzyme and is currently under development for the treatment of type-2 diabetes. The pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin were evaluated in rats, dogs, and monkeys and used to predict its human pharmacokinetics. Saxagliptin was rapidly absorbed and had good bioavailability (50-75%) in the species tested. The plasma clearance of saxagliptin was higher in rats (115 ml/min/kg) than in dogs (9.3 ml/min/kg) and monkeys (14.5 ml/min/kg) and was predicted to be low to moderate in humans. The plasma elimination half-life was between 2.1 and 4.4 h in rats, dogs, and monkeys, and both metabolism and renal excretion contributed to the overall elimination. The primary metabolic clearance pathway involved the formation of a significant circulating, pharmacologically active hydroxylated metabolite, M2. The volume of distribution values observed in rats, dogs, and monkeys (1.3-5.2 l/kg) and predicted for humans (2.7 l/kg) were greater than those for total body water, indicating extravascular distribution. The in vitro serum protein binding was low (< or =30%) in rats, dogs, monkeys, and humans. After intra-arterial administration of saxagliptin to Sprague-Dawley and Zucker diabetic fatty rats, higher levels of saxagliptin and M2 were observed in the intestine (a proposed major site of drug action) relative to that in plasma. Saxagliptin has prolonged pharmacodynamic properties relative to its plasma pharmacokinetic profile, presumably due to additional contributions from M2, distribution of saxagliptin and M2 to the intestinal tissue, and prolonged dissociation of both saxagliptin and M2 from DPP4.
17485255	Simultaneous quantification of cyclophosphamide and its active metabolite 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide in human plasma by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Cyclophosphamide is a cytotoxic prodrug with a very narrow therapeutic index. To study the clinical pharmacology of cyclophosphamide in a large cohort of patients a previously published method for the simultaneous quantitative determination of cyclophosphamide and 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide in human plasma using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was optimized. Addition of an isotopically labelled internal standard and adaptation of the gradient resulted in a fast, robust and sensitive assay. Because 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide is not stable in plasma, the compound is derivatized with semicarbazide immediately after sample collection. Sample preparation was carried out by protein precipitation with methanol-acetonitrile (1:1, v/v), containing isotopically labelled cyclophosphamide and hexamethylphosphoramide as internal standards. The LC separation was performed on a Zorbax Extend C18 column (150 mm x 2.1 mm ID, particle size 5 microm) with 1 mM ammonium hydroxide in water-acetonitrile (90:10, v/v) as the starting gradient, at a flow-rate of 0.40 mL/min with a total run time of 6 min. The lower limit of quantification (LLQ, using a 100 microL sample volume) was 200 ng/mL and the linear dynamic range extended to 40,000 ng/mL for cyclophosphamide and 50-5000 ng/mL for 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide. Accuracies as well as precisions were lower than 20% at the LLQ concentration and lower than 15% for all other concentrations. This method has been successfully applied in our institute to support ongoing studies into the pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics of cyclophosphamide.
23786350	Metabolism and disposition of [(14)C]dimethylamine borane in male Harlan Sprague Dawley rats following gavage administration, intravenous administration and dermal application. 1. Dimethylamine borane (DMAB) is used as a reducing agent in the manufacturing of a variety of products and in chemical synthesis. National Toxicology Program is evaluating the toxicity of DMAB in rodents following dermal application. The objective of this study was to evaluate the metabolism and disposition of DMAB in male Harlan Sprague Dawley (HSD) rats. 2. Disposition of radioactivity was similar between gavage and intravenous administration of 1.5 mg/kg [(14)C] DMAB, with nearly 84%-89% of the administered radioactivity recovered in urine 24 h post dosing. At 72 h, only 1% or less was recovered in feces, 0.3% as CO2, and 0.5%-1.4% as volatiles and 0.3%-0.4 % in tissues. 3. The absorption of [(14)C]DMAB following dermal application was moderate; percent dose absorbed increased with the dose, with 23%, 32% and 46% of dose absorbed at 0.15, 1.5 and 15 mg/kg, respectively. Urinary and fecal excretion ranged from 18%-37% and 2%-4% of dose, respectively, and 0.1%-0.2% as CO2, and 1%-3% as volatiles. Tissue retention of the radiolabel was low ∼1%, but was higher than following the gavage or intravenous administration. 4. Following co-adminsitration of DMAB and sodium nitrite by gavage, N-nitrosodimethylamine was not detected in blood or urine above the limit of quantitation of the analytical method of 10 ng/mL. 5. Absorption of DMAB in fresh human skin in vitro was ∼41% of the applied dose: the analysis of the receptor fluid shows that the intact DMAB complex can be absorbed through the skin.
23132334	In vitro investigations into the roles of drug transporters and metabolizing enzymes in the disposition and drug interactions of dolutegravir, a HIV integrase inhibitor. Dolutegravir (DTG; S/GSK1349572) is a potent HIV-1 integrase inhibitor with a distinct resistance profile and a once-daily dose regimen that does not require pharmacokinetic boosting. This work investigated the in vitro drug transport and metabolism of DTG and assessed the potential for clinical drug-drug interactions. DTG is a substrate for the efflux transporters P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and human breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Its high intrinsic membrane permeability limits the impact these transporters have on DTG's intestinal absorption. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 is the main enzyme responsible for the metabolism of DTG in vivo, with cytochrome P450 (P450) 3A4 being a notable pathway and UGT1A3 and UGT1A9 being only minor pathways. DTG demonstrated little or no inhibition (IC(50) values > 30 μM) in vitro of the transporters Pgp, BCRP, multidrug resistance protein 2, organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1/3, organic cation transporter (OCT) 1, or the drug metabolizing enzymes CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4, UGT1A1, or 2B7. Further, DTG did not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, or 3A4 mRNA in vitro using human hepatocytes. DTG does inhibit the renal OCT2 (IC(50) = 1.9 μM) transporter, which provides a mechanistic basis for the mild increases in serum creatinine observed in clinical studies. These in vitro studies demonstrate a low propensity for DTG to be a perpetrator of clinical drug interactions and provide a basis for predicting when other drugs could result in a drug interaction with DTG.
23530019	Nicotine kinetics in zebra finches in vivo and in vitro. Nicotine enhances cognitive performance, and in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), which is a well-established model of cognition, the effects of nicotine on song production have been reported. Nicotine and cotinine plasma levels were assessed in vivo after subcutaneous injection of 0.18 mg/kg nicotine, a dose that elicits changes in song production. The half-life of nicotine elimination was 33 minutes, and levels were undetectable by 4 hours. Average plasma nicotine over 2 hours was 32 ng/ml, similar to levels seen in human smokers and rat models of nicotine behavior. Nicotine brain levels were 30 and 14 ng/g 1 and 2 hours after treatment. To understand the potential for drug interactions and the regulation of nicotine metabolism in zebra finches, we characterized in vitro nicotine metabolism and the hepatic enzyme involved. In humans, cytochrome P450 2A6 metabolizes nicotine to cotinine, and CYP2A-like activity and protein have been reported in some birds. Zebra finch liver microsomes metabolized nicotine and bupropion (a CYP2B substrate) but not coumarin (a CYP2A substrate). Nicotine was metabolized to cotinine with a Michaelis-Menten constant (K(m)) of 96 µM and a V(max) of 56 pmol/min per milligram. Nicotine and bupropion metabolism was inhibited by C-8-xanthate (a specific CYP2B inhibitor) but not by CYP2A-specific inhibitors, and hepatic levels of CYP2B-like but not CYP2A-like proteins correlated with nicotine (r = 0.52; P = 0.04) and bupropion metabolism (r = 0.81; P < 0.001), suggesting CYP2B-mediation of nicotine metabolism as seen in rats. These results will facilitate further investigation of nicotine's effects in zebra finches.
15885659	Metabolic activation of zebularine, a novel DNA methylation inhibitor, in human bladder carcinoma cells. Zebularine (2(1H)-pyrimidinone riboside, Zeb), a synthetic analogue of cytidine that is a potent inhibitor of cytidine deaminase, has been recently identified as a general inhibitor of DNA methylation. This inhibition of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) is hypothesized to be mechanism-based and result from formation of a covalent complex between the enzyme and zebularine-substituted DNA. Metabolic activation of Zeb thus requires that it be phosphorylated and incorporated into DNA. We have quantitatively assessed the phosphorylation and DNA incorporation of Zeb in T24 cells using 2-[(14)C]-Zeb in conjunction with gradient anion-exchange HPLC and selected enzymatic and spectroscopic analyses. The corresponding 5'-mono-, di- and triphosphates of Zeb were readily formed in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Two additional Zeb-containing metabolites were tentatively identified as diphosphocholine (Zeb-DP-Chol) and diphosphoethanolamine adducts. Intracellular concentrations of Zeb-TP and Zeb-DP-Chol were similar and greatly exceeded those of other metabolites. DNA incorporation occurred but was surpassed by that of RNA by at least seven-fold. Equivalent levels and similar intracellular metabolic patterns were also observed in the Molt-4 (human T-lymphoblasts) and MC38 (murine colon carcinoma) cell lines. For male BALB/c nu/nu mice implanted s.c. with the EJ6 variant of T24 bladder carcinoma and treated i.p. with 500mg/kg 2-[(14)C]-Zeb, the in vivo phosphorylation pattern of Zeb in tumor tissue examined 24h after drug administration was similar to that observed in vitro. The complex metabolism of Zeb and its limited DNA incorporation suggest that these are the reasons why it is less potent than either 5-azacytidine or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and requires higher doses for equivalent inhibition of DNMT.
21671437	Structural identification of SAR-943 metabolites generated by human liver microsomes in vitro using mass spectrometry in combination with analysis of fragmentation patterns. SAR-943 (32-deoxo rapamycin) is a proliferation signal inhibitor via interaction with the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Most importantly, SAR-943 has improved chemical stability compared to rapamycin (sirolimus) and is currently under investigation as a drug coated on coronary stents. It was the goal of this study to identify the SAR-943 metabolites generated after incubation with human liver microsomes using high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) and MS/iontrap (MS(n)) and comparison of fragmentation patterns of the metabolites with those of SAR-943 and other known rapamycin derivatives. Our study showed that SAR-943 is mainly hydroxylated and/or demethylated by human liver microsomes. The structures of the following metabolites were identified: O-demethylated metabolites: 39-O-desmethyl, 16-O-desmethyl and 27-O-desmethyl SAR-943; hydroxylated metabolites: hydroxy piperidine SAR-943, 11-hydroxy, 12-hydroxy, 14-hydroxy, 23-hydroxy, 24-hydroxy, 25-hydroxy, 46-hydroxy and 49-hydroxy SAR-943; didemethylated metabolites: 16,39-O-didesmethyl and 27,39-O-didesmethyl SAR-943; demethylated-hydroxylated metabolites: 39-O-desmethyl, 23- or 24-hydroxy and 39-O-desmethyl, hydroxy piperidine SAR-943 and dihydroxylated metabolites: 12-,23- or 24-dihydroxy SAR-943. In addition, several other demethylated-hydroxylated and dihydroxylated metabolites were detected. However, their exact structures could not be identified.
21254313	Investigation of the in vitro metabolism of the emerging drug candidate S107 for doping-preventive purposes. The metabolic fate of the emerging drug candidate S107, possessing the potential for misuse as performance-enhancing agent in sports, was investigated by in vitro phase I and II experiments with human microsomal and S9 liver enzymes. The metabolites were identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry with electrospray ionisation in positive mode (LC-ESI-MS/MS). Their collision-induced dissociation behaviour was studied by high-resolution/high accuracy Orbitrap MS(n) analysis, supported by stable isotope labelling, H/D-exchange experiments and density functional theory calculations. Monooxygenation accounted for the main phase I metabolic transformation due to N- and S-oxidation of the 1,4-benzothiazepine core, as substantiated by chemical synthesis, selective reduction methods and characteristic APCI in source fragmentation behaviour of the metabolites. Another dominant metabolic pathway was demethylation, yielding the N- and O-demethylated metabolite, respectively. The latter was further conjugated by glucuronidation as well as sulfonation in subsequent phase II metabolic reactions, whereas the N-demethylated metabolite was not amenable to conjugation. The active drug molecule itself was converted to two glucuronic acid conjugates, which are proposed to consist of two quaternary S107-N(+)-glucuronide isomers. All glucuronides were susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis with β-glucuronidase (Escherichia coli). A comprehensive LC-ESI-MS(/MS)-based detection method for urine was developed and its fitness for purpose was assessed. The assay can serve as a potential screening and/or confirmation method for S107 in clinical drug testing and doping control analysis in the future.
12438516	Extrapolation of diclofenac clearance from in vitro microsomal metabolism data: role of acyl glucuronidation and sequential oxidative metabolism of the acyl glucuronide. Diclofenac is eliminated predominantly (approximately 50%) as its 4'-hydroxylated metabolite in humans, whereas the acyl glucuronide (AG) pathway appears more important in rats (approximately 50%) and dogs (>80-90%). However, previous studies of diclofenac oxidative metabolism in human liver microsomes (HLMs) have yielded pronounced underprediction of human in vivo clearance. We determined the relative quantitative importance of 4'-hydroxy and AG pathways of diclofenac metabolism in rat, dog, and human liver microsomes. Microsomal intrinsic clearance values (CL(int) = V(max)/K(m)) were determined and used to extrapolate the in vivo blood clearance of diclofenac in these species. Clearance of diclofenac was accurately predicted from microsomal data only when both the AG and the 4'-hydroxy pathways were considered. However, the fact that the AG pathway in HLMs accounted for ~75% of the estimated hepatic CL(int) of diclofenac is apparently inconsistent with the 4'-hydroxy diclofenac excretion data in humans. Interestingly, upon incubation with HLMs, significant oxidative metabolism of diclofenac AG, directly to 4'-hydroxy diclofenac AG, was observed. The estimated hepatic CL(int) of this pathway suggested that a significant fraction of the intrahepatically formed diclofenac AG may be converted to its 4'-hydroxy derivative in vivo. Further experiments indicated that this novel oxidative reaction was catalyzed by CYP2C8, as opposed to CYP2C9-catalyzed 4'-hydroxylation of diclofenac. These findings may have general implications in the use of total (free + conjugated) oxidative metabolite excretion for determining primary routes of drug clearance and may question the utility of diclofenac as a probe for phenotyping human CYP2C9 activity in vivo via measurement of its pharmacokinetics and total 4'-hydroxy diclofenac urinary excretion.
17151190	Glucuronidation of anti-HIV drug candidate bevirimat: identification of human UDP-glucuronosyltransferases and species differences. Bevirimat [BVM, PA-457, 3-O-(3',3'-dimethylsuccinyl)-betulinic acid], a new anti-human immunodeficiency virus drug candidate, is metabolized to two monoglucuronides [mono-BVMG (I) and mono-BVMG (II)] and one diglucuronide (di-BVMG) both in vivo and in vitro. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) reaction screening, enzyme kinetics, and species differences for the glucuronidation of BVM in vitro were investigated with pooled human liver microsomes (HLMs) and human intestinal microsomes (HIMs), animal liver microsomes, and 12 recombinant human UGT isoforms. Glucuronidation of BVM with HLMs predominantly involved the formation of mono-BVMG (I) (V(max) = 61 pmol/min/mg protein, K(m) = 27 microM) and mono-BVMG (II) (V(max) = 48 pmol/min/mg protein, K(m) = 16 microM). Di-BVMG was also observed but was a minor metabolite. HIMs mainly revealed glucuronidation to form mono-BVMG (II) (V(max) = 90 pmol/min/mg of protein, K(m) = 8.3 microM). UGT1A3 predominantly formed mono-BVMG (I) (V(max) = 65 pmol/min/mg of protein, K(m) = 13 microM), whereas UGT1A4 is a less active isoform (V(max) = 1.8 pmol/min/mg of protein, K(m) = 5.6 microM). UGT2B7 was involved in the formation of both mono-BVMG (I) (V(max) = 6.1 pmol/min/mg of protein, K(m) = 6.0 microM) and mono-BVMG (II) (V(max) = 6.5 pmol/min/mg of protein, K(m) = 7.8 microM). Among the animal liver microsomes examined, all species (rat, mouse, dog, and marmoset) demonstrated conjugation to form both mono-BVMG (I) and mono-BVMG (II), with dog liver microsomes exhibiting a higher formation rate for mono-BVMG (I), whereas marmoset liver microsomes showed a higher formation rate for mono-BVMG (II). The data suggest a primary role of UGT1A3 for the glucuronidation of BVM.
16940083	Metabolic activation of pradefovir by CYP3A4 and its potential as an inhibitor or inducer. Metabolic activation of pradefovir to 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine (PMEA) was evaluated by using cDNA-expressed CYP isozymes in portal vein-cannulated rats following oral administration and in human liver microsomes. The enzyme induction potential of pradefovir was evaluated in rats following multiple oral dosing and in primary cultures of human hepatocytes. The results indicated that CYP3A4 is the only cDNA-expressed CYP isozyme catalyzing the conversion of pradefovir to PMEA. Pradefovir was converted to PMEA in human liver microsomes with a K(m) of 60 microM, a maximum rate of metabolism of 228 pmol/min/mg protein, and an intrinsic clearance of about 359 ml/min. Addition of ketoconazole and monoclonal antibody 3A4 significantly inhibits the conversion of pradefovir to PMEA in human liver microsomes, suggesting the predominant role of CYP3A4 in the metabolic activation of pradefovir. Pradefovir at 0.2, 2, and 20 microM was neither a direct inhibitor nor a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, and CYP1A2 in human liver microsomes. In rats, the liver was the site of metabolic activation of pradefovir, whereas the small intestine did not play a significant role in the metabolic conversion of pradefovir to PMEA. Daily oral dosing (300 mg/kg of body weight) to rats for 8 days showed that pradefovir was not an inducer of P450 enzymes in rats. Furthermore, pradefovir at 10 microg/ml was not an inducer of either CYP1A2 or CYP3A4/5 in primary cultures of human hepatocytes.
23338754	In vivo and in vitro metabolism of a novel β2-adrenoceptor agonist, trantinterol: metabolites isolation and identification by LC-MS/MS and NMR. Trantinterol is a novel β(2)-adrenoceptor agonist used for the treatment of asthma. The aim of this study is to identify the metabolites of trantinterol using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), to isolate the main metabolites, and confirm their structures by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Urine, feces, bile, and blood samples of rats were obtained and analyzed. Reference standards of six metabolites were achieved with the combination of chemical synthesis, microbial transformation, and the model systems of rats. Moreover, in order to investigate the phase I metabolism of trantinterol in humans and to study the species differences between rats and humans, incubations with liver microsomes were performed. The biotransformation by a microbial model Cunninghamella blakesleana AS 3.970 was also studied. A total of 18 metabolites were identified in vivo and in vitro together, 13 of which were newly detected. Three phase I metabolites were detected in vivo and in vitro as well as in the microbial model, including the arylhydroxylamine (M1), the tert-butyl hydroxylated trantinterol (M2) and the 1-carbonyltrantinterol (M3). Another important pathway in rats is glutathione conjugation and further catabolism and oxidation to form consecutive derivatives (M4 through M10). Other metabolites include glucuronide, glucoside, and sulfate conjugates. The results of in vitro experiments indicate no species difference exists among rats, humans, and C. blakesleana AS 3.970 on the phase I metabolism of trantinterol. Our study provided the most comprehensive picture for trantinterol in vivo and in vitro metabolism to this day, and may predict its metabolism in humans.
16809797	Pharmacokinetics and safety profile of ispronicline (TC-1734), a new brain nicotinic receptor partial agonist, in young healthy male volunteers. Recent research suggests that drugs activating nicotine acetylcholine receptors might be promising therapy in cognitive decline seen in the elderly, including Alzheimer's disease. Ispronicline (TC-1734), a brain-selective alpha4beta2 nicotine acetylcholine receptor partial agonist, has shown memory-enhancing properties in rodents and a good tolerability profile. The safety and the full pharmacokinetic profile of TC-1734 and its N-desalkylated metabolite, TC-1784, were investigated in 2 phase I studies, and results are reported in this article. Study A used a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design with a rising single-dose scheme (2-320 mg). Study B used a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group design with a rising multiple-dose scheme (doses: 50, 100, and 200 mg, once daily, x 10 days). Cmax of TC-1734 was reached around 1 to 2 hours postdose, and mean terminal half-life (t1/2) ranged from 3 to 5.3 hours (single doses) and from 2.7 to 8.8 hours (repeated doses). No accumulation of TC-1734 was observed after 10 days. Renal clearance appeared to be a minor method of elimination of TC-1734 and TC-1784. A high interindividual variability was noted for all parameters. Across the dose ranges explored, TC-1734 was safe and well tolerated. No changes of clinical significance were seen on laboratory and cardiovascular parameters. Adverse events were generally of mild to moderate intensity, with dizziness and headache being reported most frequently.
2291876	Pharmacokinetics of CGP 6140 (amocarzine) after oral administration of single 100-1600 mg doses to patients with onchocerciasis. The concentrations of CGP 6140 [4-nitro-4'-(N-methyl-piperazinylthiocarbonylamido)-diphenylamine] and of its N-oxide metabolite, CGP 13,231, were measured in plasma and urine after single oral dose of 100-1600 mg of CGP 6140 to 41 fasted Ghanaian patients with Onchocerca volvulus infections. The absorption of CGP 6140 was rapid and its terminal elimination half-life was about 3 h. The plasma concentrations of CGP 6140 were essentially proportional to the dose. A greater variability in plasma concentrations was apparent after the 800 and 1600 mg doses indicating a poor bioavailability of the drug administered in fasting conditions to several patients. In plasma, the concentrations of CGP 13,231 were similar to those of CGP 6140. The amount of CGP 13,231 excreted in urine was 25-40% of the dose of CGP 6140 whereas only 1.5% was excreted as unchanged drug. If a single dose of drug is used for the treatment, the plasma concentration would be maintained for 3-4 h at a high level. At 8 h, the concentration falls to about 10% of the Cmax. If sustained plasma concentrations of the drug are needed for efficacy, twice daily administration would maintain the minimum concentration at about 10% of the Cmax.
24103433	Enantioselective determination of 3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) in human plasma by liquid chromatography on a teicoplanin-based chiral column coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. A novel and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated to determine the exposure of 3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) enantiomers in human plasma. The NBP enantiomers were extracted from human plasma using methyl tert-butyl ether. The baseline separation of R-(+)-NBP and S-(-)-NBP was achieved within 11.0min using a teicoplanin-based Astec Chirobiotic T column (250mm×4.6mm i.d., 5μm) under isocratic conditions at a flow rate of 0.6mL/min. The selection of the chiral stationary phase and the effect of the mobile phase composition on the resolution of the enantiomers were discussed. The selectivity, linearity, precision, accuracy, matrix effect, recovery, and stability were evaluated under optimized conditions. The LC-MS/MS method using 200μL of human plasma was linear over the concentration range of 5.00-400ng/mL for each enantiomer. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for both enantiomers was 5.00ng/mL. The intra- and inter-assay precision values of the replicated quality control samples were within 8.0% for each enantiomer. The mean accuracy values for the quality control samples were within ±6.1% of the nominal values for R-(+)-NBP and S-(-)-NBP. No chiral inversion was observed during sample storage, preparation, and analysis. The method proved suitable for enantioselective pharmacokinetic studies of NBP after an oral administration of a therapeutic dose of racemic NBP.
15764713	Human metabolism of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib: identification of circulating metabolites. Bortezomib [N-(2,3-pyrazine)carbonyl-L-phenylalanine-L-leucine boronic acid] is a potent first-in-class dipeptidyl boronic acid proteasome inhibitor that was approved in May 2003 in the United States for the treatment of patients with relapsed multiple myeloma where the disease is refractory to conventional lines of therapy. Bortezomib binds the proteasome via the boronic acid moiety, and therefore, the presence of this moiety is necessary to achieve proteasome inhibition. Metabolites in plasma obtained from patients receiving a single intravenous dose of bortezomib were identified and characterized by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Metabolite standards that were synthesized and characterized by LC/MS/MS and high field nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) were used to confirm metabolite structures. The principal biotransformation pathway observed was oxidative deboronation, most notably to a pair of diastereomeric carbinolamide metabolites. Further metabolism of the leucine and phenylalanine moieties produced tertiary hydroxylated metabolites and a metabolite hydroxylated at the benzylic position, respectively. Conversion of the carbinolamides to the corresponding amide and carboxylic acid was also observed. Human liver microsomes adequately modeled the in vivo metabolism of bortezomib, as the principal circulating metabolites were observed in vitro. Using cDNA-expressed cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, it was determined that several isoforms contributed to the metabolism of bortezomib, including CYP3A4, CYP2C19, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP2C9. The development of bortezomib has provided an opportunity to describe the metabolism of a novel boronic acid pharmacophore.
8785383	Comparison of plasma and saliva concentrations of the active monohydroxy metabolite of oxcarbazepine in patients at steady state. A study was performed in ten patients, stabilized with oxcarbazepine monotherapy (450-750 mg bid) for two weeks minimum, to investigate the possibility of using saliva to monitor the oxcarbazepine therapy. Thirteen paired blood and saliva samples were taken over 24 h. The saliva samples were obtained after stimulation. The analysis performed on the data suggests a dose dependence for the relationship between plasma and saliva concentrations of the main active metabolite, 10, 11-dihydro-10-hydroxycarbamazepine (MHD), and the importance of the type of stimulation for the saliva's production. Therefore it would be preferable to use plasma concentrations to monitor oxcarbazepine therapy, if necessary.
12101631	Development of a urinary biomarker for exposure to the organophosphate propetamphos: data from an oral and dermal human volunteer study. Propetamphos is a member of the vinyl phosphate group of insecticides and is mainly used for sheep dipping. There have been no published metabolic studies on the effect of propetamphos in man to date, although the present authors have published the identification of a metabolite. The present paper presents data from a human volunteer study investigating the toxicokinetics of the organophosphorus pesticide propetamphos following oral and dermal exposure. Five volunteers ingested a propetamphos dose of 10 micrograms kg-1 (35 nmol kg-1) body weight. Following a washout of 4 weeks, a 100 mg (356 mumol) dermal dose of propetamphos was applied, occluded to 80 cm2 of the inner forearm, for 8 h to the same five volunteers. In a pilot study (several weeks before the main study), one volunteer also received an occluded dermal dose of 50 mg (178 mumol) propetamphos. Unabsorbed propetamphos on the skin was washed off after 8 h and collected. Blood and urine samples were collected over 30 and 54 h for the oral and dermal exposures respectively. Blood samples were analysed for plasma and erythrocyte cholinesterase. Urine samples were analysed for a urinary metabolite of propetamphos: methylethylphosphoramidothioate (MEPT). Following oral and dermal exposure, peak urinary MEPT levels occurred at 1 and 10-12 h respectively. The apparent urinary elimination half-lives of MEPT had means of 1.7 h (oral exposure) and 3.8 h (dermal exposure). Approximately 40% of the oral dose and 1% of the dermal dose were recovered as urinary MEPT or metabolites, which could be hydrolysed to MEPT. Approximately 90% of the dermal dose was recovered from the skin washings. Data from a volunteer showed that a doubling of the dermal dose resulted in approximately double the concentration of total MEPT. Alkaline hydrolysis of urine samples increased the level of MEPT detected after both oral and dermal doses. The increase was greater and statistically significant (p < 0.001, paired t-test) for the dermal dose. This increase in MEPT suggests the presence of other MEPT-containing metabolites or conjugates. The difference in the increase between oral and dermal doses raises the question of a difference in metabolism between the two routes. No individual showed a significant depression compared with their pre-exposure levels of erythrocyte acetyl cholinesterase or plasma cholinesterase activity for either dosing route. However, on a group basis, there was a statistically significant mean depression in plasma cholinesterase activity at 8 and 24 h for oral exposure, with a maximum mean depression of 7% from pre-exposure levels at 8 h. Hydrolysis of urine samples had the effect of reducing the interindividual coefficient of variation (CV) for total excretion of MEPT following both oral (CV reduced from 36 to 8%) and dermal (CV reduced from 40 to 17%) exposure. The ability to detect and follow the elimination of low doses of propetamphos by measurement of 'total' (after hydrolysis) urinary MEPT suggests it is a suitable biomarker of propetamphos exposure. The comparatively short elimination half-lives suggest a strategy for biological monitoring of occupational exposure based on samples collected at the end of the shift.
11950781	3-O-methyldobutamine, a major metabolite of dobutamine in humans. Dobutamine is a synthetic ionotropic catecholamine commonly used to treat heart failure and shock. The catabolic fate of dobutamine in humans has yet to be reported, although formation of 3-O-methyldobutamine represents the principal pathway of dobutamine disposition in the dog. Herein, we describe the isolation and identification of 3-O-methyldobutamine in the urine of children receiving infusions of racemic dobutamine. In a 9-year-old child with heart failure approximately 80% of dobutamine administered intravenously at steady state was detected in the urine. Forty-seven percent of infused dobutamine was identified as 3-O-methyldobutamine and its acid-hydrolyzed derivatives, the latter mostly conjugated with sulfate (33%). Thirty-two percent consisted of acid-hydrolyzed dobutamine metabolites, primarily conjugated with sulfate (16%). Sonicates of human blood mononuclear cells catalyzed the formation of 3-O-methyldobutamine from dobutamine and S-adenosylmethionine in vitro. These findings indicate that formation of 3-O-methyldobutamine constitutes a major pathway of dobutamine metabolism in humans.
19118083	Ketoconazole increases fingolimod blood levels in a drug interaction via CYP4F2 inhibition. The sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator fingolimod is predominantly hydroxylated by cytochrome CYP4F2. In vitro experiments showed that ketoconazole significantly inhibited the oxidative metabolism of fingolimod by human liver microsomes and by recombinant CYP4F2. The authors used ketoconazole as a putative CYP4F2 inhibitor to quantify its influence on fingolimod pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects. In a 2-period, single-sequence, crossover study, 22 healthy subjects received a single 5-mg dose of fingolimod in period 1. In period 2, subjects received ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily for 9 days and a single 5-mg dose of fingolimod coadministered on the 4th day of ketoconazole treatment. Ketoconazole did not affect fingolimod t(max) or half-life, but there was a weak average increase in C(max) of 1.22-fold (90% confidence interval, 1.15-1.30). The AUC over the 5 days of ketoconazole coadministration increased 1.40-fold (1.31-1.50), and the full AUC to infinity increased 1.71-fold (1.53-1.91). The AUC of the active metabolite fingolimod-phosphate was increased to a similar extent by 1.67-fold (1.50-1.85). Ketoconazole predose plasma levels were not altered by fingolimod. The magnitude of this interaction suggests that a proactive dose reduction of fingolimod is not necessary when adding ketoconazole to a fingolimod regimen. The clinician, however, should be aware of this interaction and bear in mind the possibility of a fingolimod dose reduction based on clinical monitoring.
20371737	Effects of hepatic dysfunction on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. Fesoterodine, a new antimuscarinic for the treatment of overactive bladder, is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed by nonspecific esterases to its principal active moiety, 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT). The elimination of 5-HMT involves metabolism and renal excretion. The plasma and urinary pharmacokinetics of 5-HMT and its inactive carboxy (SPM 5509), N-desisopropyl (SPM 7789), and carboxy-N-desisopropyl (SPM 7790) metabolites were investigated after a single oral dose of 8 mg of fesoterodine in 8 male subjects with moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Turcotte-Pugh class B) and 8 matched healthy controls. The estimated mean ratios (95% confidence interval) of the area under the curve extrapolated to infinity after dosing (AUC(0-∞)), cumulative urinary excretion up to 48 hours after dosing (Ae(0-48)), maximum observed concentration (C(max)), and apparent terminal disposition half-life (t(1/2)) of 5-HMT for cirrhotic and healthy subjects were 2.2 (1.5-3.1), 2.5 (1.7-3.8), 1.4 (1.0-1.9), and 1.1 (0.8-1.3), respectively. In subjects with hepatic cirrhosis, AUC(0-∞) and Ae(0-48) of 5-HMT increased approximately 2-fold; the increase in C(max) was smaller, and t(1/2) was unaffected. AUC and C(max) of the inactive carboxy metabolites, SPM 5509 and SPM 7790, were reduced reciprocally by about 50%, whereas exposure to the dealkylated metabolite, SPM 7789, increased about 2-fold. Fesoterodine 8 mg was equally well tolerated in both groups. The results indicate that moderate hepatic cirrhosis reduces 5-HMT clearance, with an apparent effect on the carboxylation pathway and not on dealkylation.
8857076	Interindividual variability in the rate of salbutamol sulphation in the human lung. The beta2-adrenergic agonist salbutamol is administered by inhalation to treat lung-obstructive disease. Salbutamol is metabolized by conjugation with sulphate, and the sulphation of salbutamol was investigated in human lung. Specimens of lung were obtained at lobectomy from 11 non-smokers, 39 smokers and 46 ex-smokers, the latter refraining from smoking at least 6 months before surgery. Neither sex nor ageing influenced the activity of sulphotransferase. The rate of salbutamol sulphation (pmol center dot min-1 center dot mg-1) was greater in non-smokers (27.7) than in smokers (21.3), whereas it was similar in smoker and ex-smokers (22.8). The rate of salbutamol sulphation ranged up to six fold and its distribution did not deviate from normality. As the rate of formation of the inactive salbutamol sulphate varied in the lung, the availability of salbutamol and, in turn, the evoked pharmacological effect should vary in parallel. The activities of salbutamol and dopamine sulphotransferase correlated, suggesting that catechol sulphotransferase takes part in the sulphation of salbutamol. The sulphation of salbutamol is stereoselective in the human lung, the kM estimate for (+)- salbutamol (1198 mu M) being greater than those for either (-)-salbutamol (190 mu M) and racemic salbutamol (142 mu M). These results are consistent with the view that (-)-salbutamol is a better substrate than (+)-salbutamol for sulphotransferase.
17689219	Development of LC/MS/MS assay for the determination of 5-ethyl-2-{5-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-sulfonyl]-2-propoxyphenyl}-7-propyl-3,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidin-4-one (SK3530) in human plasma: application to a clinical pharmacokinetic study. 5-Ethyl-2-{5-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-sulfonyl]-2-propoxyphenyl}-7-propyl-3,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidin-4-one (SK3530) is a new phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor currently undergoing a Phase III investigation for the treatment of male erectile dysfunction. This study first describes a rapid and sensitive LC/MS/MS assay method for the quantification of SK3530 and its major metabolite, SK3541, in human plasma. The assay was validated to demonstrate the specificity, linearity, recovery, lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), accuracy, and precision. The multiple reaction monitoring was based on the transition of m/z=532.5-->99.1 for SK3530, 488.6-->295.5 for SK3541, and 520.3-->99.1 for SK3304 (internal standard). The assay utilized a single liquid-liquid extraction and isocratic elution, and the LLOQ was 1 ng/ml using 0.2 ml human plasma. The assay was linear over a range from 1 to 1000 ng/ml for both SK3530 and SK3541, with correlation coefficients >0.9999. The mean intra- and inter-day assay accuracy ranged from 94.7 to 101.6% and 96.8 to 101.1% for SK3530 and 92.6-105.7% and 97.4-107.8% for SK3541, respectively. The mean intra- and inter-day precision was between 7.2-12.1% and 5.7-7.4% for SK3530 and 4.6-13.2% and 5.0-14.1% for SK3541, respectively. The developed assay was applied to a clinical pharmacokinetic study after oral administration of SK3530 in healthy male volunteers (dose 100 mg).
6636824	The metabolism and excretion of (+)-[14C]cyanidanol-3 in man following oral administration. Following administration of a single dose of [U14C]cyanidanol-3 to human volunteers, a mean of 55% of the dose of 14C was excreted in urine; 90% of urine 14C was excreted within 24 h of drug administration. The major urinary metabolites were the glucuronides of (+)-catechin and 3'-O-methyl-(+)-catechin, and the sulphate of the latter. These three conjugates collectively accounted for three quarters of urine 14C. Urinary excretion of unchanged (+)-cyanidanol-3 was 0.1-1.4% dose. (+)-Cyanidanol-3 and metabolites containing the intact flavanol ring system accounted for 90% of urine 14C. Ring scission was, under these conditions, a minor metabolic pathway resulting in the excretion of small amounts of 3-hydroxybenzoic acid, 3-hydroxyhippuric acid and 3-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid. Unchanged (+)-cyanidanol-3 was detected in plasma between 30 min and 12 h after administration. Metabolites (as total 14C) persisted in plasma for at least 120 h after administration.
12920164	Comparative studies on the cytochrome p450-associated metabolism and interaction potential of selegiline between human liver-derived in vitro systems. Selegiline was used as a model compound in a project aimed at comparing, evaluating, and integrating different in vitro approaches for the prediction of cytochrome p450 (p450)-catalyzed hepatic drug metabolism in humans (EUROCYP). Metabolic predictions were generated using homology modeling, cDNA-expressed p450 enzymes, human liver microsomes, primary cultured human hepatocytes, and precision-cut human liver slices. All of the in vitro systems correctly indicated the formation of two dealkylated metabolites, desmethylselegiline and methamphetamine. The metabolic instability of selegiline was demonstrated by all of the in vitro systems studied. Estimates of clearance varied from 16 l/h to 223 l/h. With the exception of one approach, all systems underpredicted the in vivo clearance in humans (236 l/h). Despite this, all approaches successfully classified selegiline as a high clearance compound. Homology modeling suggested the participation of CYP2B6 in the demethylation of selegiline and of CYP2D6 in the depropargylation of the drug. Studies with recombinant expressed enzymes and with human hepatic microsomal fraction supported the involvement of CYP2B6 but not of CYP2D6. These techniques also suggested the involvement of CYP1A2, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19 in the biotransformation of selegiline. In vitro, CYP2B6 was the most active form of p450 involved in selegiline metabolism. Metabolism by several enzymes operating in parallel implies a low interaction potential for the drug. None of the techniques alone was able to predict all aspects of the metabolic and kinetic behavior of selegiline in vivo. However, when used as an integrated package, all significant characteristics were predictable.
23624235	The development of an analytical method for urinary metabolites of the riot control agent 2-chlorobenzylidene malononitrile (CS). The analysis of biomedical samples such as urine and blood can provide evidence of exposure to chemicals for a range of applications including occupational exposure monitoring, detection of drugs of abuse, performance enhancement in sport and investigations of poisoning and incapacitation. This paper reports the development of an analytical method for two suspected urinary metabolites of the riot control agent 2-chlorobenzylidene malononitrile (CS): 2-chlorohippuric acid and 2-chlorobenzyl-N-acetylcysteine. 2-Chlorohippuric acid was identified in all 2h post-exposure samples from a set of urine samples taken from army recruits exposed to low levels of thermally dispersed CS during training. 2-Chlorobenzyl-N-acetylcysteine, a metabolite known to be formed in the rat, was not identified in any of the samples. The lower limit of detection (LLOD) for 2-chlorohippuric acid and 2-chlorobenzyl-N-acetylcysteine was 1ng/ml and 0.5ng/ml in pooled urine from the pre-exposed subjects. 2-Chlorohippuric acid was rapidly excreted but was detectable in the urine of 17 of the 19 subjects tested 20h after exposure.
12820810	Metabolism of tenofovir and didanosine in quiescent or stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. As tenofovir disoproxil fumarate substantially increases plasma concentrations of didanosine in patients with human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection, we sought to determine whether tenofovir and didanosine showed a similar intracellular interaction in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Comparative in vitro incubation of two antiretrovirals in lymphocytes. Clinical research laboratory. Radiolabeled tenofovir and didanosine in human PBMCs. Phosphorylation of 2 and 20 microM didanosine to dideoxyadenosine triphosphate (ddATP) was determined in quiescent and stimulated PBMCs in the presence or absence of 5 microM tenofovir. Similarly, phosphorylation of 5 microM tenofovir to tenofovir diphosphate (TFVpp) was examined in the presence or absence of 2 and 20 microM didanosine. Intracellular amounts of ddATP and TFVpp were determined by incubating PBMCs with radiolabeled tenofovir or didanosine alone and together for up to 16 hours and then separating the anabolites by high-performance liquid chromatography for quantitation. The presence of tenofovir did not affect the amount of ddATP in quiescent or stimulated PBMCs with 2 or 20 microM didanosine. In addition, didanosine did not alter the amount of TFVpp that formed. The amount of ddATP was modestly (1.5-3-fold) but consistently higher in stimulated than in quiescent PBMCs, but the amount of TFVpp did not differ. There is no significant interaction between tenofovir and didanosine in human PBMCs as determined by the extent of formation of the phosphorylated anabolites. This suggests that adjusting didanosine dosage, when given with tenofovir, to achieve similar didanosine plasma concentrations, may be sufficient to accommodate the systemic drug interaction.
19808136	Pharmacokinetics and tolerability of single escalating doses of gabapentin enacarbil: a randomized-sequence, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in healthy volunteers. Gabapentin enacarbil is an actively transported prodrug of gabapentin that provides predictable dose-proportional gabapentin exposure with high (> or =68%) oral bioavailability. The aims of this study were to investigate the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of gabapentin enacarbil up to supratherapeutic doses and the effects of gabapentin enacarbil on cardiac repolarization in healthy volunteers, and to provide a dose reference for a future definitive QT/corrected QT (QTc) study. This was a randomized-sequence, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single escalating-dose, crossover study of gabapentin enacarbil 600-mg extended-release tablets administered as a single oral dose of 2400, 3600, 4800, or 6000 mg or placebo, with a 1-week washout between administrations. Blood samples were collected over a period of 36 hours after administration and were analyzed using a validated method of liquid chromatography/tandem mass spec-trometry. Blood gabapentin enacarbil and gabapentin concentrations were analyzed using noncompartmental methods. Tolerability was assessed by monitoring adverse events (AEs) (using subject interview/reporting), laboratory parameters, vital sign measurements, and 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG). Holter ECG was also performed. Thirty-two healthy volunteers were included in the study (18 women, 14 men; mean [SD] age, 31.2 [11.4] years; body mass index, 24.9 [3.04] kg/m(2)). Gabapentin enacarbil was converted rapidly to gaba-pentin after absorption. Gabapentin exposure in blood was proportional to gabapentin enacarbil dose over the range of 2400 to 6000 mg (1250-3125 mg-equivalent gabapentin). Blood concentrations of intact gabapen-tin enacarbil were low and transient (< or =0.5% of the released gabapentin concentration at all doses). The most commonly reported AEs were dizziness and nausea (50% and 25% of subjects, respectively). All but 4 AEs were mild to moderate in intensity. Two subjects experienced treatment-emergent AEs rated as severe: psychomotor retardation, vertigo, and sedation (4800-mg dose) and somnolence (6000 mg). All treatment-emergent AEs resolved without medical intervention. No serious AEs were reported, and none of the AEs led to study withdrawal. There were no clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters, vital sign measurements, or ECG values; QTc intervals did not exceed 480 msec or change from baseline >30 msec at any gabapentin enacarbil dose. Gabapentin enacarbil was associated with dose-proportional gabapentin exposure at doses up to 6000 mg and was generally well tolerated in these healthy subjects. These findings support the use of 6000-mg gabapentin enacarbil in a definitive QT/QTc study.
239208	High-pressure liquid chromatographic analysis of triflubazam and its metabolites in human and animal blood and urine. A high-pressure liquid chromatographic method is described for analyzing triflubazam [1-methyl-5-phenyl-7-trifluoromethyl-1H-1,5-benzodiazepine-2,4(3H,5H)-dione] and its primary metabolites in blood and urine. Adsorption chromatography, using pellicular silica gel as the stationary phase and dioxane-isooctane as the mobile phase, permitted rapid sample analysis. After extraction of blood and urine samples with toluene, quantitation is achieved using liquid chromatography with an internal standard. The method is sensitive above 50 ng/ml of triflubazam and its known metabolites. Recoveries for all compounds from blood or urine averaged above 95 percent. The specificity of the method was established by collecting samples separated by liquid chromatography and characterizing them by mass spectrometry. Human and animal data are presented to illustrate the utility of the method.
21735164	Do CYP2D6 genotypes reflect oxycodone requirements for cancer patients treated for cancer pain? A cross-sectional multicentre study. Opioids are recommended by the World Health Organization for moderate to severe cancer pain. Oxycodone is one of the most commonly used opioids and is metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess the relationship between oxycodone pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and the CYP2D6 genotypes "poor metaboliser" (PM), "extensive metaboliser" (EM) and "ultra-rapid metaboliser" (URM) in a cohort of patients with cancer pain. The patients were genotyped for the most common CYP2D6 variants and serum concentrations of oxycodone and metabolites were determined. Pain was assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). The EORTC QLQ-C30 was used to assess the symptoms of tiredness and nausea. Cognitive function was assessed by the Mini Mental State (MMS) examination. Associations were examined by analyses of variance (ANOVA) and covariance (ANCOVA), or ordinal logistic regressions with and without covariates. The sample consisted of 27 PM, 413 EM (including heterozygotes) and 10 URM. PM had lower oxymorphone and noroxymorphone serum concentrations and oxymorphone to oxycodone ratios than EM and URM. No differences between PM, EM and URM in pain intensity, nausea, tiredness or cognitive function was found. CYP2D6 genotypes caused expected differences in pharmacokinetics, but they had no pharmacodynamic consequence. CYP2D6 genotypes did not influence pain control, the adverse symptoms nausea and sedation or the risk for cognitive failure in this study of patients treated with oxycodone for cancer pain.
19913464	Improved method for identifying and quantifying olive oil phenolic compounds and their metabolites in human plasma by microelution solid-phase extraction plate and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Two methods based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) using traditional cartridges and microelution SPE plates (muSPE) as the sample pre-treatment, and an improved liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) were developed and compared to determine the phenolic compounds in virgin oil olive from plasma samples. The phenolic compounds studied were hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, homovanillic acid, p-coumaric acid, 3,4-DHPEA-EDA, p-HPEA-EDA, luteolin, apigenin, pinoresinol and acetoxypinoresinol. Good recoveries were obtained in both methods, and the LOQs and LODs were similar, in the range of low muM. The advantage of muSPE, in comparison with SPE cartridges, was the lack of the evaporation step to pre-concentrate the analytes. The muSPE-UPLC-ESI-MS/MS method developed was then applied to determine the phenolic compounds and their metabolites, in glucuronide, sulphate and methylated forms, in human plasma after the ingestion of virgin olive oil.
16221753	Metabolism and disposition of varenicline, a selective alpha4beta2 acetylcholine receptor partial agonist, in vivo and in vitro. The metabolism and disposition of varenicline (7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-6,10-methano-6H-pyrazino[2,3-h][3]benzazepine), a partial agonist of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor for the treatment of tobacco addiction, was examined in rats, mice, monkeys, and humans after oral administration of [14C]varenicline. In the circulation of all species, the majority of drug-related material was composed of unchanged varenicline. In all four species, drug-related material was primarily excreted in the urine. A large percentage was excreted as unchanged parent drug (90, 84, 75, and 81% of the dose in mouse, rat, monkey, and human, respectively). Metabolites observed in excreta arose via N-carbamoyl glucuronidation and oxidation. These metabolites were also observed in the circulation, in addition to metabolites that arose via N-formylation and formation of a novel hexose conjugate. Experiments were conducted using in vitro systems to gain an understanding of the enzymes involved in the formation of the N-carbamoylglucuronide metabolite in humans. N-Carbamoyl glucuronidation was catalyzed by UGT2B7 in human liver microsomes when incubations were conducted under a CO2 atmosphere. The straightforward dispositional profile of varenicline should simplify its use in the clinic as an aid in smoking cessation.
18683862	Physiological models are good tools to predict rat bioavailability of EF5154 prodrugs from in vitro intestinal parameters. There are only a few reports on the methods that predict in vivo bioavailability from in vitro intestinal parameters. In the present study, we constructed physiological models where we examined if in vivo rat bioavailability was predictable from in vitro intestinal parameters using prodrugs of EF5154, a potent glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist, and other prodrugs. Apparent fraction absorbed (F(a),pred) was calculated using the physiological models that consist of absorption number calculated from Caco-2 cell membrane permeability (P(app)), and Damkohler number calculated from apparent degradation rate constant (K(dapp)) in rat small intestinal fluid. The predicted rat bioavailability that was calculated from F(a),pred corresponded to the observed rat bioavailability, and root mean square error (RMSE) and squared correlation coefficient (r(2)) were 4.58 and 0.904, respectively, suggesting that the physiological models consisting of the membrane permeability and degradation rate constant are good tools for predicting rat bioavailability of EF5154 prodrugs. As for other prodrugs where the chemical structure of their active forms differs from EF5154, the predicted rat bioavailability was not different from fraction absorbed (or rat bioavailability), suggesting the physiological models are generalized to various prodrugs that are not the substrates for active transporters.
2219959	Conjugation of chemical carcinogens by primary cultures of human hepatocytes. 1. The conjugation of benzo[a]pyrene (BP) and 2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF) was investigated in primary cultures of human hepatocytes. Human hepatocytes conjugated 12.5-63% of the BP and 1.7-52% of the AAF to sulphates and glucuronides over a thousand-fold concentration range. 2. BP is conjugated to glucuronides from non-detectable levels to 50%, and to sulphates from non-detectable levels to 30%. The major conjugated metabolites are the highly polar metabolites. 3. AAF is conjugated to glucuronides from 1.5 to 51% and to sulphates from 0.2 to 12%. The C-hydroxylated AAF metabolites were conjugated to glucuronides more than N-hydroxy AAF and aminofluorene metabolites.
15811173	A study of the in vitro interaction between lidocaine and premedications using human liver microsomes. To investigate potential interactions between lidocaine (lignocaine) metabolism and premedication drugs, i.e. psychotropic and antianxiety agents (diazepam, midazolam), hypnotics (pentobarbital, thiamylal), depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (vecuronium, pancuronium and suxamethonium), an antihypertensive agent (clonidine) and an H2-receptor blocking agent (cimetidine) using human liver microsomes in vitro. The interaction effects between lidocaine and premedication were examined using human liver microsomal preparations and monitored for enzyme activity. The lidocaine and its main metabolite (monoethylglycinexylide) were measured by HPLC/UV. Lidocaine metabolism was non-competitively inhibited by midazolam (Ki = 77.6 microM). Thiamylal was a competitive inhibitor of lidocaine metabolism (Ki = 885 microM). Cimethidine, pancuronium and vecuronium weakly inhibited lidocaine metabolism in a concentration-depend manner over the therapeutic range in human liver microsomes. On the contrary, suxamethonium, pentobarbital and clonidine did not inhibit lidocaine metabolism over the therapeutic range in human liver microsomes. These results show that the interactions between lidocaine and midazolam and thiamylal are of potential toxicological and clinical significance.
15906166	Experimental and computational studies of epithelial transport of mefenamic acid ester prodrugs. A series of ester derivatives of mefenamic acid were synthesized with the aim of suppressing local gastrointestinal toxicity of mefenamic acid. A computational method was used to assist the design of the prodrug and to gain insights into the structure relationship of these compounds as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates. The prodrugs were studied for their enzymatic stability, bidirectional permeability across Caco-2 monolayer, and their potential as transporter modulators Bidirectional transport studies were performed using Caco-2 cells. Compounds exhibiting an efflux ratio of > or =2 were further examined for their potential interaction with P-gp and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) using verapamil and indomethacin. Calcein efflux inhibition studies were conducted to investigate the efflux mechanism of these compounds. Geometry optimization of the esters was performed, and the spatial separation of two electron donor groups of each prodrug was measured. Morpholinoethyl ester (3) and pyrrolidinoethyl ester (4) of mefenamic acid showed evidence of efflux mechanism. Inhibition by verapamil had a pronounced effect on the transport of 3 and 4. Indomethacin, however, completely inhibited the apical efflux of 3 but enhanced the efflux ratio of 4. Both compounds increased the ratio of cellular calcein accumulation by 3- to 5-fold over control. Consistent with the experimental data, the computational results suggest the involvement of P-gp or its interaction in 3 and 4 transport. Apical efflux of 3 is associated with P-gp and MRP, but the efflux of 4 involves P-gp and/or MRP. The computational approach used in this study provided the basis for P-gp substrates of compounds 3 and 4 from their electron donor subunits spatial separation.
15155554	Selective inhibition of CYP2B6-catalyzed bupropion hydroxylation in human liver microsomes in vitro. Some inhibitory agents against CYP2B6 have been reported, but none of these has been extensively characterized or compared with others, as to the potency and selectivity of inhibition toward CYP2B6. The goal of this work was to find a selective and potent chemical in vitro inhibitor toward CYP2B6 using bupropion hydroxylation as a model reaction. At the initial screening of more than 30 substances, ticlopidine, triethylenethiophosphoramide (thioTEPA), metyrapone, xanthate C8, and benzylisothiocyanate displayed IC(50) values of <10 microM and were selected for a more detailed analysis. Metyrapone, xanthate C8, and benzylisothiocyanate inhibited several other cytochrome P450 activities rather effectively, some of them even more potently than CYP2B6, and consequently are unsuitable as CYP2B6-selective probes. Ticlopidine and thioTEPA were the most potent inhibitors of bupropion hydroxylation with K(i) values of 0.2 and 2.8 microM, respectively. The inhibition type of ticlopidine was found to be mixed type, with a component of mechanism-based inhibition, whereas thioTEPA inhibited CYP2B6 in a competitive manner. In addition to CYP2B6, ticlopidine also inhibited both mephenytoin 4-hydroxylation (CYP2C19) (IC(50), 2.7 microM) and dextromethorphan O-demethylation (CYP2D6) (IC(50), 4.4 microM). For thioTEPA the next sensitive P450 activity after CYP2B6 was coumarin 7-hydroxylation (IC(50), 256 microM). Thus, although both compounds proved to be relatively potent inhibitors of CYP2B6, thioTEPA was about 2 orders of magnitude more selective than ticlopidine. Thus, thioTEPA is a drug of choice when high CYP2B6 selectivity among major P450 enzymes is required. Ticlopidine is a useful alternative under a controlled experimental setup and when higher potency is needed.
16997912	CYP4F enzymes are the major enzymes in human liver microsomes that catalyze the O-demethylation of the antiparasitic prodrug DB289 [2,5-bis(4-amidinophenyl)furan-bis-O-methylamidoxime]. DB289 [2,5-bis(4-amidinophenyl)furan-bis-O-methylamidoxime] is biotransformed to the potent antiparasitic diamidine DB75 [2,5-bis(4-amidinophenyl) furan] by sequential oxidative O-demethylation and reductive N-dehydroxylation reactions. Previous work demonstrated that the N-dehydroxylation reactions are catalyzed by cytochrome b5/NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase. Enzymes responsible for catalyzing the DB289 O-demethylation pathway have not been identified. We report an in vitro metabolism study to characterize enzymes in human liver microsomes (HLMs) that catalyze the initial O-demethylation of DB289 (M1 formation). Potent inhibition by 1-aminobenzotriazole confirmed that M1 formation is catalyzed by P450 enzymes. M1 formation by HLMs was NADPH-dependent, with a Km and Vmax of 0.5 microM and 3.8 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively. Initial screening showed that recombinant CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1 were efficient catalysts of M1 formation. However, none of these three enzymes was responsible for M1 formation by HLMs. Further screening showed that recombinant CYP2J2, CYP4F2, and CYP4F3B could also catalyze M1 formation. An antibody against CYP4F2, which inhibited both CYP4F2 and CYP4F3B, inhibited 91% of M1 formation by HLMs. Two inhibitors of P450-mediated arachidonic acid metabolism, HET0016 (N-hydroxy-N'-(4-n-butyl-2-methylphenyl)formamidine) and 17-octadecynoic acid, effectively inhibited M1 formation by HLMs. Inhibition studies with ebastine and antibodies against CYP2J2 suggested that CYP2J2 was not involved in M1 formation by HLMs. Additionally, ketoconazole preferentially inhibited CYP4F2, but not CYP4F3B, and partially inhibited M1 formation by HLMs. We conclude that CYP4F enzymes (e.g., CYP4F2, CYP4F3B) are the major enzymes responsible for M1 formation by HLMs. These findings indicate that, in human liver, members of the CYP4F subfamily biotransform not only endogenous compounds but also xenobiotics.
21080678	Mechanistic studies on a P450-mediated rearrangement of BMS-690514: conversion of a pyrrolotriazine to a hydroxypyridotriazine. BMS-690514 ((3R,4R)-4-amino-1-((4-((3-methoxyphenyl)amino)pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4] triazin-5-yl)methyl)-3-piperidinol) is an oral oncologic agent being developed for the treatment of patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer and breast cancer. The compound is metabolized via multiple metabolic pathways, including P450-mediated oxidation at one of the carbons of its pyrrolotriazine group. Oxidation at this site results in the formation of two metabolites, M1 and M37. Mass spectrometric and NMR analysis revealed that M1 underwent an unusual structural change, where the pyrrolotriazine moiety rearranged to yield a hydroxypyridotriazine group. In contrast, the structure of the pyrrolotriazine moiety remained intact in M37. In vitro experiments with liver microsomes and deuterated or tritiated BMS-690514 containing the isotopic label on the carbon that underwent oxidation indicated that during the formation of M1, the isotope label was retained at the site of hydroxylation, while the label was lost during the formation of M37. On the basis of these results, a mechanism for the formation of M1 was proposed as follows: BMS-690514 was first oxidized by P450 enzymes either via epoxidation or an iron-oxo addition pathway to form a zwitterionic intermediate. This was followed by opening of the pyrrolotriazine ring to form an aldehyde intermediate, which could be partially trapped with methoxyamine. The aldehyde intermediate then reacted with the secondary amine of the methoxyaniline group in the molecule to form the pyridotriazine moiety of M1. This mechanism is consistent with the observed retention of the isotope label in M1. Metabolite M37 may be formed either via a common zwitterionic intermediate, shared with M1, or through a direct insertion pathway. In in vitro human liver microsome incubations, the abundance of M1 was higher than M37, suggesting that breaking of the carbon-nitrogen bond to generate the aldehyde intermediate, a process similar to N-dealkylation, was a preferred pathway.
16304151	Interaction of ritonavir-boosted tipranavir with loperamide does not result in loperamide-associated neurologic side effects in healthy volunteers. Loperamide (LOP) is a peripherally acting opioid receptor agonist used for the management of chronic diarrhea through the reduction of gut motility. The lack of central opioid effects is partly due to the efflux activity of the multidrug resistance transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) at the blood-brain barrier. The protease inhibitors are substrates for P-gp and have the potential to cause increased LOP levels in the brain. Because protease inhibitors, including tipranavir (TPV), are often associated with diarrhea, they are commonly used in combination with LOP. The level of respiratory depression, the level of pupil constriction, the pharmacokinetics, and the safety of LOP alone compared with those of LOP-ritonavir (RTV), LOP-TPV, and LOP-TPV-RTV were evaluated in a randomized, open-label, parallel-group study with 24 healthy human immunodeficiency virus type 1-negative adults. Respiratory depression was assessed by determination of the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide. Tipranavir-containing regimens (LOP-TPV and LOP-TPV-RTV) caused decreases in the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity for LOP (51% and 63% decreases, respectively) and its metabolite (72% and 77% decreases, respectively), whereas RTV caused increases in the levels of exposure of LOP (121% increase) and its metabolite (44% increase). In vitro and in vivo data suggest that TPV is a substrate for and an inducer of P-gp activity. The respiratory response to LOP in combination with TPV and/or RTV was not different from that to LOP alone. There was no evidence that LOP had opioid effects in the central nervous system, as measured indirectly by CO2 response curves and pupillary response in the presence of TPV and/or RTV.
1519299	Interactions between clobazam and standard antiepileptic drugs in patients with epilepsy. We retrospectively collected plasma level assessments performed in 96 adult patients with epilepsy on stable monotherapy, including 9 patients on clobazam (CLB), 34 on carbamazepine (CBZ), 24 on phenobarbital (PB), 9 on phenytoin (PHT), and 20 on valproate (VPA); these results were compared to those obtained in 54 adult patients on stable bitherapy with the association of CLB with either CBZ (n = 17), PB (n = 17), PHT (n = 5), or VPA (n = 15). Our results show that CLB has no significant effect on the level to dose ratio (LDR) of CBZ, PB, PHT, or VPA. Conversely, CBZ, PB, and PHT significantly decrease the LDR of CLB. CBZ and PHT significantly increase the LDR of N-desmethylclobazam (NCLB), the major metabolite of CLB. A significant increase in the NCLB/CLB ratio was found in CBZ + CLB, PB + CLB, and PHT + CLB bitherapies. These findings are of clinical significance: clobazam is useful as adjunctive treatment in human epilepsy and is often chosen as the benzodiazepine adjunctive drug in chronic resistant epilepsy. Sedative side effects may occur, especially in patients treated by a CBZ + CLB or PHT + CLB bitherapy, and both CLB and NCLB plasma levels should be monitored in such patients.
17489363	Enzyme kinetic study of a new cardioprotective agent, KR-32570 using human liver microsomes and recombinant CYP isoforms. KR-32570 (5-(2-Methoxy-5-chlorophenyl)furan-2-ylcarbonyl)guanidine) is a new cardioprotective agent for preventing ischemia-reperfusion injury. Human liver microsomal incubation of KR-32570 in the presence of NADPH resulted in the formation of two metabolites, hydroxy-KR-32570 and O-desmethyl-KR-32570. In this study, a kinetic analysis of the metabolism of two metabolites from KR-32570 was performed in human liver microsomes, and recombinant CYP1A2, and CYP3A4. The metabolism for hydroxy- and O-desmethyl-KR-32570 formation from KR-32570 by human liver microsomes was best described by a Michaelis-Menten equation and a Hill equation, respectively. The Cl(int) values of hydroxy- and O-desmethyl-KR-32570 formation were similar to each other (0.03 vs 0.04 microL/min/pmol CYP, respectively). CYP3A4 mediated the formation of hydroxy-KR-32570 from KR-32570 with Cl(int) = 0.24 microL/min/pmol CYP3A4. The intrinsic clearance for O-desmethyl-KR-32570 formation by CYP1A2 was 0.83 AL/min/pmol CYP1A2. These findings suggest that CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 enzymes are major enzymes contributing to the metabolism of KR-32570.
7663706	Determination of cimetidine in human plasma by free capillary zone electrophoresis. The separation of cimetidine from the metabolites cimetidine amide and cimetidine sulfoxide, endogenous creatinine and the internal standard ranitidine was achieved by capillary electrophoresis in less than 5 min. All compounds were well separated from cimetidine, including possible plasma ingredients, as the UV spectra of cimetidine standard and cimetidine from the plasma extract match. Plasma levels of cimetidine were determined in the range 250-3000 ng/ml in plasma and higher concentrations were determined by dilution of the sample with blank plasma.
22393120	Metabolic switching of BILR 355 in the presence of ritonavir. I. Identifying an unexpected disproportionate human metabolite. 11-Ethyl-5,11-dihydro-5-methyl-8-[2-[(1-oxido-4-quinolinyl)oxy] ethyl]-6H-dipyrido[3,2-b:2',3'-e][1,4]diazepin-6-one (BILR 355) is an inhibitor of the human immunodeficiency virus-1. BILR 355 exhibited a nonlinear pharmacokinetic profile and low exposure after oral administration to humans. This article describes the in vitro metabolism of BILR 355, which is correlated with the in vivo nonlinearity findings. Our in vitro studies had demonstrated that BILR 355 was extensively metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A. Thus, BILR 355 was concomitantly administered with ritonavir (RTV) in an attempt to boost systemic exposure, which did occur in humans. In addition, the expectation was that the overall metabolism of BILR 355 would be decreased with concomitant administration of RTV. Subsequent metabolite profiling was performed using human plasma samples obtained from clinical phase Ib studies with concomitant administration of BILR 355 and RTV. A total of 18 metabolites was observed. Their structures were proposed on the basis of high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry technologies, and 10 metabolites were confirmed by comparison with synthetic standards. We were surprised to find that a disproportionate human metabolite, BILR 516, was uncovered during this metabolite profiling study and pharmacokinetic analysis of BILR 516 showed that it had a longer half-life and higher exposure than the parent compound at steady state. Of interest, BILR 516 was not detected in human plasma when BILR 355 was administered alone. Therefore, whereas RTV boosted the exposure of BILR 355, it resulted in a significant metabolic switching of BILR 355. Overall, this article demonstrates an unusual example of metabolic switching and raises concern about the consequence of metabolic switching during drug development.
19420130	Comparative metabolism of 14C-labeled apixaban in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, and humans. The metabolism and disposition of [(14)C]apixaban, a potent, reversible, and direct inhibitor of coagulation factor Xa, were investigated in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, and humans after a single oral administration and in incubations with hepatocytes. In plasma, the parent compound was the major circulating component in mice, rats, dogs, and humans. O-Demethyl apixaban sulfate (M1) represented approximately 25% of the parent area under the time curve in human plasma. This sulfate metabolite was present, but in lower amounts relative to the parent, in plasma from mice, rats, and dogs. Rabbits showed a plasma metabolite profile distinct from that of other species with apixaban as a minor component and M2 (O-demethyl apixaban) and M14 (O-demethyl apixaban glucuronide) as prominent components. The fecal route was a major elimination pathway, accounting for >54% of the dose in animals and >46% in humans. The urinary route accounted for <15% of the dose in animals and 25 to 28% in humans. Apixaban was the major component in feces of every species and in urine of all species except rabbit. M1 and M2 were common prominent metabolites in urine and feces of all species as well as in bile of rats and humans. In vivo metabolite profiles showed quantitative differences between species and from in vitro metabolite profiles, but all human metabolites were found in animal species. After intravenous administration of [(14)C]apixaban to bile duct-cannulated rats, the significant portion (approximately 22%) of the dose was recovered as parent drug in the feces, suggesting direct excretion of the drug from gastrointestinal tracts of rats. Overall, apixaban was effectively eliminated via multiple elimination pathways in animals and humans, including oxidative metabolism, and direct renal and intestinal excretion.
23378626	Absorption, elimination, and metabolism of CS-1036, a novel α-amylase inhibitor in rats and monkeys, and the relationship between gastrointestinal distribution and suppression of glucose absorption. The absorption, metabolism, and excretion of (2R,3R,4R)-4-hydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)pyrrolidin-3-yl 4-O-(6-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranosyl)-α-d-glucopyranoside (CS-1036), a novel and potent pancreatic and salivary α-amylase inhibitor, were evaluated in F344/DuCrlCrlj rats and cynomolgus monkeys. The total body clearance and volume of distribution of CS-1036 were low (2.67-3.44 ml/min/kg and 0.218-0.237 l/kg for rats and 2.25-2.84 ml/min/kg and 0.217-0.271 l/kg for monkeys). After intravenous administration of [(14)C]CS-1036 to rats and monkeys, radioactivity was mainly excreted into urine (77.2% for rats and 81.1% for monkeys). After oral administration, most of the radioactivity was recovered from feces (80.28% for rats and 88.13% for monkeys) with a low oral bioavailability (1.73-2.44% for rats and 0.983-1.20% for monkeys). In rats, intestinal secretion is suggested to be involved in the fecal excretion as a minor component because fecal excretion after intravenous administration was observed (15.66%) and biliary excretion was almost negligible. Although intestinal flora was involved in CS-1036 metabolism, CS-1036 was the main component in feces (70.3% for rats and 48.7% for monkeys) and in the intestinal contents (33-68% for rats up to 2 hours after the dose) after oral administration. In Zucker diabetic fatty rats, CS-1036 showed a suppressive effect on plasma glucose elevation after starch loading with a 50% effective dose at 0.015 mg/kg. In summary, CS-1036 showed optimal pharmacokinetic profiles: low oral absorption and favorable stability in gastrointestinal lumen, resulting in suppression of postprandial hyperglycemia by α-amylase inhibition.
1600616	Acetyl transferase-mediated metabolic activation of N-hydroxy-4-aminobiphenyl by human uroepithelial cells. Metabolism and nucleic acid binding of N-hydroxy-4-aminobiphenyl (N-OH-ABP), a proximate carcinogenic metabolite of the human bladder carcinogen 4-aminobiphenyl (ABP), was investigated using cultured normal human uroepithelial cells (HUC). HPLC and TLC of the ethyl acetate extract of the media from cultured HUC after 4 h exposure to N-OH-ABP revealed the formation of two major metabolites, ABP and 4-acetylaminobiphenyl (AABP), suggesting the presence of N-acetyl transferase(s) in HUC. This was further confirmed by the formation of AABP, during the incubation of ABP with acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) and HUC cytosol. To test whether these enzymes also catalyze the AcCoA-dependent O-acetylation, we examined the metabolic activation of N-OH-ABP using cytosolic preparations. Cytosol from HUC catalyzed AcCoA-dependent binding of [3H]N-OH-ABP to RNA; the amount of binding was 757 pmol/mg RNA/mg protein. Binding with DNA was quantitatively similar to RNA. HPLC and TLC analyses of the enzymatic hydrolysate of [3H]N-OH-ABP-bound DNA revealed the major adduct to be N-(deoxyguanosine-8-yl)-4-aminobiphenyl, based on mobility of the radioactivity in comparison with the authentic synthetic standard. 32P-Post-labeling analysis of the DNA from the cytosol-mediated binding of N-OH-ABP revealed four radioactive spots. In contrast, post-labeling analysis of the DNA from intact HUC exposed to N-OH-ABP showed five adducts, including two of the adducts observed with HUC cytosols, suggesting the possible involvement of additional activation pathway(s) in intact HUC. These results suggest that bioactivation of N-OH-ABP could occur within the HUC, the target organ for ABP, and that cytosolic acetyl transferase(s) may play a critical role in susceptibility to arylamine-induced bladder carcinogenesis.
16318905	Characterization of human liver cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of rutaecarpine. Rutaecarpine has recently been characterized to have an anti-inflammatory activity through cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition. The incubation of rutaecarpine with human liver microsomes in the presence of NADPH generated six isobaric mono-hydroxylated metabolites. The specific cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes responsible for rutaecarpine metabolites were identified using the combination of chemical inhibition, immuno-inhibition and metabolism by cDNA expressed CYP enzymes. The results suggested that CYP3A4 might play major roles in the metabolism of rutaecarpine in human liver microsomes. The production of M1, M2, M3, M4 and M6 formed in human liver microsomes was inhibited by ketoconazole, a selective CYP3A4 inhibitor, and anti-CYP3A4 antibody. CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 played minor roles in the metabolism of rutaecarpine. These results were confirmed in microsomes derived from cDNA expressed lymphoblastoid cells. CYP3A4 microsome clearly formed M1, M2, M3 and M6. CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 microsomes comparably formed M5.
3929481	Metabolism of amosulalol hydrochloride in man: quantitative comparison with laboratory animals. The metabolism of amosulalol hydrochloride, (+/-)-5-[1-hydroxy-2-[[2-(o-methoxyphenoxy)ethyl]amino]ethyl]-2- methylbenzenesulphonamide hydrochloride, was studied in man and laboratory animals. Humans excreted 30.1% of dose as unchanged drug, and the sulphate conjugate of a 5-hydroxy metabolite, (+/-)-5-[1-hydroxy-2-[[2-(5-hydroxy-2-methoxyphenoxy)ethyl]-amino] ethyl]-2-methylbenzenesulphonamide, was the major metabolite. Amosulalol hydrochloride was extensively metabolized in animals with 10% or less excreted as unchanged drug. Hydroxylation of the 2-methyl group and O-demethylation of the o-methoxyphenoxy group were preferred in rats, and oxidative C-N cleavage yielding o-methoxyphenoxyacetic acid (M-5) preceded other reactions in dogs. Monkeys excreted almost equal amounts of the 5-hydroxy and 4-hydroxy metabolites as well as M-5.
15720137	A conjugated diene identified as a prohapten: contact allergenic activity and chemical reactivity of proposed epoxide metabolites. A hapten causing allergic contact dermatitis binds covalently to macromolecules via nucleophilic-electrophilic reactions or radical couplings. A prohapten can be seen as a chemically inert compound without electrophilic or radical forming properties. To exert its activity, the prohapten is activated, for example, metabolically, to the hapten. We have investigated the contact allergenic properties of a diene, (5R)-5-isopropenyl-2-methyl-1-methylene-2-cyclohexene (1), as a potential prohapten, and we found it to be a sensitizer in animal studies. The activity is likely to be exerted via epoxide metabolites. Thus, two potential metabolites of the investigated diene, (4S)-1,2-epoxy-4-isopropenyl-1-methyl-6-methylene-cyclohexane (3) and (7R)-7-isopropenyl-4-methyl-1-oxa-spiro[2.5]oct-4-ene (4), were synthesized and subjected to animal tests. Both epoxides were sensitizers. They also elicited significant reactions when tested in animals induced with 1, which indicates that they are formed from the diene in the skin. Furthermore, incubation of 1 with human liver microsomes produced both epoxides. The chemical reactivity of 1, 3, and 4 was investigated in relation to a hexapeptide, H-Pro-His-Cys-Lys-Arg-Met-OH. No adducts were obtained from reactions between the peptide and 1. However, epoxide 3 bound covalently to the cysteine residue and epoxide 4 to both the cysteine and proline residues. Since it is possible to relate the sensitizing capacity of a compound to its key physicochemical properties, knowledge-based expert systems have been developed to predict the toxicity of novel compounds by comparing the structure with activity data stored in the computer database. A diene related to 1 found in the knowledge-based expert system DEREK was considered as a nonsensitizer by this system. Our study indicates that conjugated dienes can be metabolized to contact allergens in the skin. Thus, when constructing predictive test methods based on SARs, it is important to analyze not only the virtual chemical structure of a compound but also its ability to act as a prohapten.
22246389	Metabolism of [6]-shogaol in mice and in cancer cells. Ginger has received extensive attention because of its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor activities. However, the metabolic fate of its major components is still unclear. In the present study, the metabolism of [6]-shogaol, one of the major active components in ginger, was examined for the first time in mice and in cancer cells. Thirteen metabolites were detected and identified, seven of which were purified from fecal samples collected from [6]-shogaol-treated mice. Their structures were elucidated as 1-(4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyphenyl)-4-decen-3-ol (M6), 5-methoxy-1-(4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyphenyl)-decan-3-one (M7), 3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl-decan-3-one (M8), 1-(4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyphenyl)-decan-3-ol (M9), 5-methylthio-1-(4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyphenyl)-decan-3-one (M10), 1-(4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyphenyl)-decan-3-one (M11), and 5-methylthio-1-(4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyphenyl)-decan-3-ol (M12) on the basis of detailed analysis of their (1)H, (13)C, and two-dimensional NMR data. The rest of the metabolites were identified as 5-cysteinyl-M6 (M1), 5-cysteinyl-[6]-shogaol (M2), 5-cysteinylglycinyl-M6 (M3), 5-N-acetylcysteinyl-M6 (M4), 5-N-acetylcysteinyl-[6]-shogaol (M5), and 5-glutathiol-[6]-shogaol (M13) by analysis of the MS(n) (n = 1-3) spectra and comparison to authentic standards. Among the metabolites, M1 through M5, M10, M12, and M13 were identified as the thiol conjugates of [6]-shogaol and its metabolite M6. M9 and M11 were identified as the major metabolites in four different cancer cell lines (HCT-116, HT-29, H-1299, and CL-13), and M13 was detected as a major metabolite in HCT-116 human colon cancer cells. We further showed that M9 and M11 are bioactive compounds that can inhibit cancer cell growth and induce apoptosis in human cancer cells. Our results suggest that 1) [6]-shogaol is extensively metabolized in these two models, 2) its metabolites are bioactive compounds, and 3) the mercapturic acid pathway is one of the major biotransformation pathways of [6]-shogaol.
4087830	Pharmacokinetics of oral and intravenous rifampicin during chronic administration. We investigated the pharmacokinetics of rifampicin and its major metabolites, 25-desacetylrifampicin and 3-formylrifampicin, in two groups of six patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis, who received either multiple oral or intravenous rifampicin therapy in combination with intravenous isoniazid and ethambutol. Serum concentrations of rifampicin were each determined after a single oral and intravenous test dose of 600 mg rifampicin at the beginning and after 1 and 3 weeks of tuberculostatic treatment. Analysis of rifampicin and its metabolites was performed by high-pressure liquid chromatography. It was found that, due to autoinduction of its metabolizing hepatic enzymes, the systemic clearance of rifampicin increased from 5.69 to 9.03 l/h after 3 weeks of multiple dosing. The volume of distribution of the drug was constant over the period of this study. The bioavailability of the active, orally administered rifampicin decreased from 93% after the first single oral dose to 68% after 3 weeks of oral and intravenous rifampicin therapy. Relating to the increase in systemic (hepatic) clearance, a bioavailability no lower than 90% can be predicted. The reduction to 68% indicates that, in addition to an increase of hepatic metabolism, an induction of a prehepatic "first-pass" effect resulted from multiple rifampicin doses. Our study of rifampicin metabolites confirm that prehepatic metabolism was induced, since a higher metabolic ratio resulted after the oral doses than after the intravenous rifampicin test doses. A preabsorptive process can therefore be excluded as a cause of reduced bioavailability.
15517526	Quantitative determination of the novel anticancer drug E7070 (indisulam) and its metabolite (1,4-benzenedisulphonamide) in human plasma, urine and faeces by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. E7070 (indisulam) is a novel anticancer drug currently undergoing clinical investigation. We present a sensitive and specific method for the quantitative determination of E7070 and its metabolite M1 (1,4-benzenedisulphonamide) in human plasma, urine and faeces. The analytes and their tetra-deuterated analogues, which were used as internal standards, were isolated from the biological matrix by solid-phase extraction with OASIS cartridges (0.5 mL plasma or 1 mL urine) and by liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate at pH 5 (1 mL faecal homogenate). The analytes were separated on a C8 reversed-phase chromatographic column and analyzed using electrospray ionization and tandem mass spectrometric detection in the negative ion mode. The validated concentration ranges in plasma were 0.1-20 microg/mL for E7070 and 0.01-2 microg/mL for M1. In urine and faecal homogenate, a concentration range from 0.05-10 microg/mL or microg/g, respectively, was validated for both analytes. Validation of the plasma assay was performed according to the most recent FDA guidelines. The assay fulfilled all generally accepted requirements for linearity (r > 0.99, residuals between -8 and 10%), accuracy (-13.5 to 1.4%) and precision (all less than 11%) in the tested matrices. We investigated recovery, stability (working solutions at -20 degrees C and at room temperature, biological matrices at -20 degrees C, room temperature and after 3 freeze/thaw cycles; final extracts at room temperature) and robustness. All these parameters were found acceptable. This method is suited for mass balance studies or therapeutic drug monitoring, as demonstrated by a case example showing plasma concentrations and cumulative excretion of E7070 and M1 in urine and faeces. Furthermore, we show the presence of E7070 metabolites in patient urine.
19885	The metabolism of the neuroleptic agent 1 (4'-fluorophenyl)-4-(cyclohexyl-1'-piperzinyl-4'-carboxylated)-butan-1-one hydrochloride in rats and man. 1. An oral dose the neuroleptic agent 1-(4'-fluorophenyl)-4-(cyclohexyl-1'-(14C)piperazinyl-4'-carboxylate)butan-1-one was mainly eliminated in the urine within 12 h by rats and man. During 5 days, 63-6% and 83-3% was eliminated in the urine of rats and man respectively. 2. Plasma concentrations in man related a maximum during 30 min to 1 h, representing 1-43 microgram equiv./ml. The proportion of unchanged drug in plasma decreased from 48% at 15 min to less than 10% after 1 h. 3. Seven major radioactive components were detected in the chloroform extract of basified rat urine and five major components in similar extracts of human urine. The major rat metabolites were isolated and identified by mass spectrometry as components resulting from mono- and dihydroxylation in the cyclohexane ring, reduction of the keto group to a secondary alcohol and hydrolysis and decarboxylation of the cyclohexylcarbamoyl group. The major metabolite in the rat urine extract was the dihydroxylated secondary alcohol derivative while the major human metabolite was the monohydroxylated secondary alcohol derivative. The metabolites were also partly eliminated as conjugates.
21209239	Fostamatinib, a Syk-kinase inhibitor, does not affect methotrexate pharmacokinetics in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Fostamatinib (R788) is being investigated as an add-on therapy for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients with inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX). This study evaluated the potential pharmacokinetic interaction between R788 and MTX. Sixteen RA subjects on a stable weekly MTX regimen were enrolled and received MTX on days 1 and 8. Twelve subjects received 100 mg of R788 orally, and 4 subjects received a matching placebo twice daily from days 4 to 8 and once daily on days 3 and 9. Blood samples were collected on days 1 and 8 for MTX and 7-hydroxymethotrexate (7-OH-MTX), and days 3 and 9 for R788 and its active metabolite, R406. MTX and 7-OH-MTX pharmacokinetic parameters were similar on days 1 and 8. In the R788 group, the mean day 8 to day 1 ratios (90% confidence intervals) of maximum concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve estimates were 1.01 (0.85-1.20) and 1.12 (0.90-1.40) for MTX and 1.06 (0.82-1.35) and 1.06 (0.83-1.36) for 7-OH-MTX, respectively. Urinary excretion of MTX and 7-OH-MTX was also similar with or without R788, averaging 58% to 69% and 4% to 5% of the MTX dose, respectively. The data suggest that there is no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction of R788 and MTX in RA patients.
17998295	In vitro metabolic activation of lumiracoxib in rat and human liver preparations. Recent clinical reports have suggested that the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, lumiracoxib (Prexige), may cause a rare but serious hepatotoxicity in patients. In view of the close structural resemblance between lumiracoxib and diclofenac, a widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug whose use also has been associated with rare cases of liver injury, it is possible that the toxicity of the two agents may share a common mechanism. Because it is believed that chemically reactive metabolites may play a role as mediators of diclofenac-mediated hepatotoxicity, the present in vitro study was carried out to test the hypothesis that lumiracoxib also undergoes metabolic activation when incubated with liver microsomal preparations and hepatocytes from rats and humans. By means of liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry techniques, two previously unknown N-acetylcysteine (NAC) conjugates were identified, namely, 3'-NAC-4'-hydroxy lumiracoxib (M1) and 4'-hydroxy-6'-NAC-desfluoro lumiracoxib (M2), the structures of which reveal the intermediacy of an electrophilic quinone imine species. Based on the results of studies with immunoinhibitory antibodies, it was demonstrated that the formation of M1 and M2 in human liver microsomes was catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (P450) 2C9. These findings demonstrate that lumiracoxib is subject to P450-mediated bioactivation in both rat and human liver preparations, leading to the formation of a reactive intermediate analogous to species generated during the metabolism of diclofenac.
22733806	Glutaredoxin is involved in the formation of the pharmacologically active metabolite of clopidogrel from its GSH conjugate. Clopidogrel is a thienopyridine antiplatelet agent that is converted to the active metabolite, R-361015, in vivo. Clopidogrel is first oxidized to a thiolactone intermediate R-115991. R-115991 is thought to be metabolized to a GSH conjugate of R-361015 (R-361015-SG) and then is reduced to R-361015 in the presence of GSH. In this study, we investigated the enzyme-mediated formation of R-361015 from R-361015-SG in human liver microsomes and cytosols. After incubation of R-115991 in human liver microsomes, the formation of R-361015-SG, and subsequently of R-361015, was observed. The apparent formation rate of R-361015-SG was markedly decreased when human liver cytosols were added. Fitting the data to the kinetic model showed that the rate constant of R-361015-SG reduction to R-361015 in human liver microsomes was approximately 20-fold higher in the presence of human liver cytosols (6.56 min⁻¹) than in the absence of cytosols (0.326 min⁻¹). In addition, the formation rate of R-361015 from R-361015-SG was higher in human liver cytosols (2843 ± 1176 pmol · min⁻¹ · mg⁻¹) compared with in human liver microsomes (508 ± 396 pmol · min⁻¹ · mg⁻¹). The formation of R-361015 from R-361015-SG in human liver microsomes or cytosols was inhibited by anti-human glutaredoxin antibody in a concentration-dependent manner. Recombinant human glutaredoxin mediated the formation of R-361015 from R-361015-SG with the K(m) and V(max) values of 30.0 ± 1.3 μM and 381.6 ± 209.8 pmol · min⁻¹ · μg⁻¹, respectively. The intrinsic clearance value (V(max)/K(m)) was 12.9 ± 7.5 μl · min⁻¹ · μg⁻¹. In conclusion, we found that human glutaredoxin is a main contributor to the formation of the pharmacologically active metabolite of clopidogrel from its GSH conjugate in human liver.
21916490	Mass spectrometric characterization of 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine N-oxidized metabolites bound at Cys34 of human serum albumin. 2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) is a heterocyclic aromatic amine that is formed during the cooking of meats and poultry. PhIP is a carcinogen in rodents and a potential human carcinogen. Several short-term biomarkers of PhIP have been established for human biomonitoring, but validated long-term biomarkers of the biologically effective dose of PhIP remain to be developed. Metabolites of PhIP have been reported to covalently bind to human serum albumin (SA), which is the most abundant protein in plasma; however, the chemical structures of PhIP-SA adducts are unknown. Cysteine(34) is one of 35 conserved Cys residues in SA across species. Thirty-four of these Cys are involved in 17 disulfide bonds. The single unpaired Cys(34) residue in SA is well-known to react with carcinogenic metabolites and toxic electrophiles. 2-Nitro-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (NO(2)-PhIP), 2-hydroxyamino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (HONH-PhIP), and 2-nitroso-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (NO-PhIP), three genotoxic metabolites of PhIP, were reacted with purified human SA or human plasma, and the SA adduction products, following enzymatic digestion, were separated by ultra performance liquid chromatography and characterized with a linear quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. The major adduct of NO(2)-PhIP was formed at the Cys(34) of SA with bond formation occurring between the sulfhydryl group of Cys and the C-2 imidazole atom of PhIP. The major adducts formed between SA and HNOH-PhIP or NO-PhIP were identified as acid-labile sulfinamide linkages at Cys(34). These PhIP-SA adducts represent a measure of bioactivation of PhIP and may serve as long-term biomarkers of the biologically effective dose of PhIP.
8486332	Identification of the human and animal hepatic cytochromes P450 involved in clonazepam metabolism. This report characterizes the cytochrome P450 isozyme involved in clonazepam metabolism. This study was undertaken using a library of liver microsomal fractions prepared from untreated rabbits or those treated with drugs known to specifically induce various cytochrome P450 isozymes (ie P450 2B4 by phenobarbital, P450 1A1 and P450 1A2 by 3-methylcholanthrene and beta-naphthoflavone, P450 2E1 by acetone and ethyl alcohol, and P450 3A6 by erythromycin). Only microsomes obtained from phenobarbital-treated rabbits exhibited a type II binding spectrum upon addition of clonazepam (Ks(app) = 31.4 +/- 3.8 microM) and significantly metabolized clonazepam to 7-aminoclonazepam. Benzphetamine, which is a known substrate for P450 2B1 was also extensively metabolized by microsomes prepared from phenobarbital treated rabbits. This indicates that the same isozyme (P450 2B subfamily) was involved in the biotransformation of both substrates. Experiments performed on 14 human liver microsomal preparations showed a wide interindividual variability (from 1-4) and a good correlation (r = 0.70) between benzphetamine and clonazepam metabolism. Since P450 3A4 (nf25) was involved in benzphetamine metabolism, clonazepam was probably nitroreduced by the same isozyme. An oligonucleotide specific for the P450 3A4 gene subfamily was synthetized and used for hybridization on total RNA from human liver samples. Two transcripts of 2.2 and 3.0 kb were detected and the level of the 2.2 kb mRNA expression was significantly correlated (r = 0.61) with the intensity of clonazepam nitroreduction by the corresponding microsome batches.
24097405	Characterization of metabolites of GLS4 in humans using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. GLS4 is a heteroaryldihydropyrimidine compound that inhibits hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication by drug-induced depletion of nucleocapsids. It is currently undergoing clinical trials in China to treat HBV infection. The aim of this study was to identify the metabolites of GLS4 in humans. A rapid and sensitive method based on ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify GLS4 metabolites in human plasma, urine, and feces after an oral dose of 120 mg GLS4. A total of 27 metabolites were detected and identified by comparing the accurate molecular masses, retention times and spectral patterns of the analytes with those of the parent drug. Nine metabolites were confirmed by comparison with reference substances. All of the metabolites had a bromine atom and displayed the isotope ion of [M + H](+)/[M + H + 2](+) at a ratio of 1:1. Fragmentation of the dihydropyrimidine structure was characterized by the loss of the m-bromofluorobenzene group to generate an ion at m/z 220.0175. The morpholine ring was characterized by an ion at m/z 100.0757. The metabolites of GLS4 in humans were identified by the diagnostic ions of dihydropyrimidine and morpholine rings. GLS4 underwent extensive dealkylation, hydrolysis, dehydrogenation, oxidation, and glucuronidation reactions in humans.
22931187	Disposition and metabolism of [¹⁴C]PTZ601 in healthy volunteers. 1. Six healthy male subjects were given a single dose of 500 mg of [14C]PTZ601 (mean radioactivity 79.2 μCi) by intravenous (IV) infusion over 1 h, and observed for 5 days post-dose during which pharmacokinetic (PK) samples were collected. Plasma PTZ601 concentrations and metabolite identification were determined using LC-MS/MS; PK parameters were estimated by non-compartmental analysis. Excretion and mass balance were determined with liquid scintillation analysis and metabolites profiling was characterized by HPLC online radiochemical detection. 2. The disposition of PTZ601 was best described by a fast absorption, followed by a biphasic elimination phase. Peak PTZ601 plasma concentrations were reached within 0.5-1 h. The mean elimination half-life was 1.6 h and clearance was 13 L/h. 3. Recovery of the radioactivity dose was complete (mean 92%). The main route of excretion (parent and metabolites) was the renal route, as urine accounted for 69-77%, while feces only 13-22%, of the total radioactivity. 4. The majority of the drug was excreted in urine as multiple open ring metabolites: M17.3 (oxidative ring-opened product) and M22.2 (di-cysteine conjugate of 17.3); unchanged PTZ601 in urine contributed to 15% of radioactivity. The major metabolites detected in plasma were M17.3, M12.8 (acetylated M17.3), M22.2, and M41.4 (methylated M17.3). 5. PTZ601 was well tolerated.
20821331	Pharmacokinetic results of a phase I trial of sorafenib in combination with dacarbazine in patients with advanced solid tumors. Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor of Raf and several growth factor receptors, is under investigation in combination with dacarbazine, a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of many cancers. The current phase I study investigates the effects of sorafenib on the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of dacarbazine and its metabolite 5-amino-imidazole-4-carboxamide (AIC). (AIC is formed in amounts equimolar to the active alkylating moiety, methane diazohydroxide, which is undetectable by known validated assays.) Patients with advanced solid tumors received intravenous dacarbazine 1,000 mg/m(2) on day 1 of a 21-day cycle to evaluate the PK of dacarbazine alone. Sorafenib 400 mg was administered twice daily continuously starting at day 2 of cycle 1. The PK of dacarbazine in the presence of sorafenib was assessed on day 1 of cycle 2. Sorafenib PK was also assessed at steady state. PK data were available for 15 of 23 patients. With concomitant administration of sorafenib, the mean AUC and C (max) values of dacarbazine were reduced by 23 and 16%, respectively. Mean AUC and C (max) values of AIC were increased by 41 and 45%, respectively, with individual increases of up to 106 and 136%, respectively. The apparent terminal half-lives of the two compounds were not significantly influenced by sorafenib. Based on coefficients of variation, the AUC and C (max) values for sorafenib and its three metabolites were highly variable with dacarbazine coadministration. Concomitant administration of sorafenib and dacarbazine as described above may result in decreased dacarbazine exposure but increased AIC exposure.
14709624	The olivacine derivative s 16020 (9-hydroxy-5,6-dimethyl-N-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)-6H-pyrido(4,3-B)-carbazole-1-carboxamide) induces CYP1A and its own metabolism in human hepatocytes in primary culture. The olivacine derivative 9-hydroxy-5,6-dimethyl-N-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)-6H-pyrido(4,3-b)-carbazole-1-carboxamide (S 16020) exhibits a potent antitumor activity. However, when administered in cancer patients, its blood clearance increases after repeated administrations, whereas the volume of distribution remains constant, suggesting that the drug is able to induce its own metabolism. The aim of this work was to identify the enzymes involved in S 16020 metabolism and determine whether this molecule is an enzyme inducer in human hepatocytes in primary cultures. Among a battery of cDNA-expressed cytochromes P450 (P450s) and flavin monooxygenase (FMO), only CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and FMO3 were able to generate detectable amounts of metabolites of S 16020. In primary hepatocytes, S 16020 behaved as a CYP1A inducer, producing an increase in CYP1A2 protein, acetanilide 4-hydroxylation, ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation, and chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylation to an extent similar to that of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a prototypical CYP1A inducer. The levels of other P450 proteins, including CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4, and related activities were not affected by S 16020. In primary hepatocytes, pretreatment of cells with S 16020 or TCDD produced a significant and similar increase of S 16020 metabolism, consistent with the previous indications on the role of CYP1As. We conclude that CYP1As and FMO3 are the major phase I enzymes involved in the metabolism of S 16020 and that this molecule is a potent hydrocarbon-like inducer able to stimulate its own metabolism in primary human hepatocytes and liver.
16379042	In vitro characterization of the human biotransformation and CYP reaction phenotype of ET-743 (Yondelis, Trabectidin), a novel marine anti-cancer drug. ET-743 is a potent marine anti-cancer drug and is currently being investigated in phase I and II clinical trials, e.g. in combination with other anti-cancer agents. To assess the biotransformation and CYP reaction phenotype and their potential implications for human pharmacology and toxicology, the in vitro metabolism of ET-743 was characterized using incubations with human liver preparations, cytochrome P450 (CYP) and uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase (UGT) supersomes.CYP supersomes and liver microsomes showed that ET-743 was metabolized mainly by CYP3A4, but also by CYP2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 2E1. ET-743 showed the highest affinity for CYP3A4 and the highest maximal metabolic rate for CYP2D6 among the CYPs shown to metabolize ET-743. In addition, the Km value of ET-743 in female microsomes was significantly lower compared to male microsomes, while the Vmax values did not differ. ET-743 glucuronidation, catalyzed by UGT2B15, was observed in microsomes and S9 fraction. In addition, conjugation by glutathione-S-transferase and no sulphation was observed for ET-743 in cytosol and S9 fraction. ET-743 was more extensively metabolized when CYP activity was combined with phase II enzymes UGT and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), indicating that CYP, UGT, and GST simultaneously metabolize ET-743 in the S9 fraction. These results provide evidence that CYP3A4 has a major role in the metabolism of ET-743 in vitro with additional involvement of CYP2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 2E1. Furthermore, ET-743 is conjugated by UGT and GST. This information could be important for interpretation of the pharmacokinetic data of clinical trials and prediction of drug-drug interactions.
18236489	Synthesis and biological activity of a novel inhibitor of dihydroceramide desaturase. A novel mechanism-based dihydroceramide desaturase inhibitor (XM462) in which the substrate C5 methylene group is replaced by a sulfur atom is reported. Dihydroceramide desaturase inhibition occurred both in vitro and in cultured cells with IC(50) values of 8.2 and 0.78 microM, respectively, at a substrate concentration of 10 microM. In vitro experiments showed that XM462 produced a mixed-type inhibition (K(i)=2 microM, alpha=0.83). LC-MS analyses showed that accumulation of endogenous dihydroceramides occurred in cells upon treatment with XM462 in serum-free medium, whereas ceramides built up in controls. In addition, XM462 was found to be metabolised to its 1-glucosyl and 1-phosphocholine derivatives, and to the products of N-deacylation and reacylation with palmitoyl and stearoyl groups. In Jurkat A3 cells cultured in serum-free medium, viability, as the percentage of trypan blue unstained cells in total cells, was reduced upon XM462 treatment (5 microM, 24 h), but not in controls. The interest of this compound is discussed.
12820211	Quantitative determination of paroxetine and its 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy metabolite in plasma by high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ion trap mass spectrometry: application to pharmacokinetic studies. A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with tandem mass spectrometric detection is described for the determination of paroxetine, an antidepressant drug, and its metabolite (3S,4R)-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenoxymethyl)piperidine (HM paroxetine) in human plasma. Plasma samples were hydrolysed with hydrochloric acid and then analytes were extracted with ethyl acetate at alkaline pH. Extracts were analysed by HPLC coupled to an atmospheric pressure ionisation-electrospray (ESI) interface and an ion trap mass spectrometer. Chromatography was performed on a reversed-phase column using acetonitrile/0.02% formic acid (66:34, v/v) as a mobile phase. The mass spectrometer was operated in the multiple reaction monitoring mode. The method was validated over concentration ranges of 0.75-100 microg/L and 5-100 microg/L for paroxetine and HM paroxetine, respectively. Mean recoveries of 77% for paroxetine and 76% for HM paroxetine were found, with precision always better than 15%. The limits of detection and quantification were 0.20 and 0.70 microg/L for paroxetine, and 0.70 and 2.20 microg/L for its metabolite. The method was applied to the analysis of plasma samples obtained from nine healthy male volunteers administered with a single oral dose of 20 mg paroxetine. After the 20-mg dose, the mean peak plasma concentration was 8.60 microg/L for paroxetine and 92.40 microg/L for HM paroxetine showing a tenfold ratio between the metabolite and the parent drug along the entire time-concentration curve.
20642349	Pharmacokinetic variability of voriconazole and N-oxide voriconazole measured as therapeutic drug monitoring. Voriconazole (VRC), a triazole agent is extensively metabolized by CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and to a lesser extent, by CYP3A4. Few data are available regarding disposition of the main VRC metabolite (MVRC; UK121,265). The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetic variability of VRC and MVRC plasma concentrations on the basis of 115 drug monitoring samples from patients treated with VRC. Plasma concentrations of VRC and MVRC were determined by HPLC assay. During the study period, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of 39 adult in- and out-patients were realized. The residual interquartile range (IQR) were 0.5-2.6 mg/l (median: 1.4 mg/l) for VRC plasma concentrations and 1.6-3.4 mg/l for MVRC (median: 2.5 mg/l). Median IQR metabolic ratio [VRC]/[MVRC] was 0.2-1.1 (median: 0.6 mg/l). VRC C(min) was <1 mg/l in 41% of cases and <0.5 mg/l in 25% of them. Patients with VRC C(min) <1 mg/l have a lower [VRC]/[MVRC] ratio than patients with VRC C(min) ≥1 mg/l (median ratio 0.1 vs. 1.0 p < 0.0001). VRC TDM is now recommended to optimize their benefit/risk ratio. In addition, measurement of MVRC in unstable patients could quickly detect patients with impaired metabolism, in cases of subtherapeutic (C(min) <1 mg/l) or toxic (C(min) >5 mg/l) VRC plasma levels.
22688609	Metabolism of the active metabolite of quetiapine, N-desalkylquetiapine in vitro. The antipsychotic drug quetiapine has been approved for the treatment of unipolar and bipolar depression. The antidepressant activity is considered to be mediated by the active metabolite N-desalkylquetiapine, which is mainly formed by CYP3A4. Little is known about the subsequent elimination of this metabolite. Therefore, this study investigated the possible involvement of cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes in the metabolism of N-desalkylquetiapine. Screening for and interpretation of metabolites were performed by incubating N-desalkylquetiapine in human liver microsomes (HLM) followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The possible involvement of P450 enzymes in N-desalkylquetiapine metabolism was evaluated by coincubation of selective P450 inhibitors in HLM and subsequent experiments with recombinant human P450 enzymes. In HLM experiments, three chromatographic peaks were interpreted as possible metabolites of N-desalkylquetiapine, namely, N-desalkylquetiapine sulfoxide, 7-hydroxy-N-desalkylquetiapine, and an unrecognized metabolite (denoted M3). Inhibition of CYP2D6 (by quinidine) reduced formation of 7-hydroxy-N-desalkylquetiapine by 81%, whereas the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole inhibited formation of N-desalkylquetiapine sulfoxide and M3 by 65 and 34%, respectively. Inhibitors of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 showed only limited changes in metabolite formation. In recombinant systems, 7-hydroxy-N-desalkylquetiapine was exclusively formed by CYP2D6, whereas N-desalkylquetiapine sulfoxide and M3 were formed by both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Overall, intrinsic clearance of N-desalkylquetiapine was 12-fold higher by recombinant CYP2D6 relative to CYP3A4. In conclusion, N-desalkylquetiapine is metabolized by both CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in vitro with preference for the former enzyme. The pharmacologically active metabolite, 7-hydroxy-N-desalkylquetiapine, was exclusively formed by CYP2D6, whereas the two other metabolites were mainly formed by CYP3A4.
15708677	In vitro metabolism of a new oxazolidinedione hypoglycemic agent utilizing liver microsomes and recombinant human cytochrome P450 enzymes. The compound, 5-{4-[3-(4-cyclohexyl-2-propylphenoxy)propoxy]phenyl}-1,3-oxazolidine-2,4-dione (compound A) is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) agonist. PPARgamma agonists have proven useful in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, which is characterized by hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and/or abnormal insulin secretion. The metabolism of this oxazolidinedione (OZD) was investigated in male rat, dog, monkey and human liver microsomes, and recombinant human cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4) in the presence of NADPH. Routes of metabolism included monohydroxylation of the cyclohexane ring at multiple positions, monohydroxylation of the n-propyl side chain or the tether linkage, and OZD ring opening, giving rise to the keto amide and alcohol amide entities. Liver microsomes showed subtle qualitative and quantitative metabolic differences among rat, dog, monkey and human preparations. Further, CYP2C8 and CYP2C19 did not display different regioselectivity for hydroxylation on the cyclohexane ring with both of them giving rise to C-3 and C-4 hydroxy metabolites, but they did display different stereoselectivity with CYP2C8 preferring cyclohexane hydroxylation in equatorial positions and CYP2C19 in axial positions.
18840518	Differences in simulated liver concentrations of toxic coumarin metabolites in rats and different human populations evaluated through physiologically based biokinetic (PBBK) modeling. Coumarin is bioactivated via 3,4-epoxidation resulting in formation of the hepatotoxic o-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (oHPA) and detoxified by cytochrome P450 2A6 (CYP2A6) hydroxylation leading to 7-hydroxycoumarin. The present study defines physiologically based biokinetic (PBBK) models to predict liver levels of the toxic oHPA metabolite of coumarin in rats and in human subjects with normal or deficient CYP2A6 catalyzed coumarin 7-hydroxylation. The results reveal that the predicted maximum tissue concentration (C(max)) of oHPA in the liver of wild type human subjects and of subjects deficient in CYP2A6 catalyzed 7-hydroxylation are, respectively, three and one order of magnitude lower than the values predicted for rat liver. Another difference between CYP2A6 deficient and wild type human subjects is a 500-fold difference in the area under the curve 0-24h (AUC(0-24h)) for the time-dependent oHPA liver concentration pointing at a relative higher percentage of the original dose converted in time through this pathway when CYP2A6 is deficient. For wild type human subjects and the subjects with completely deficient coumarin 7-hydroxylation the AUC(0-24h) values for oHPA in the liver are, respectively, three and one order of magnitude lower than that for rat liver. Even when 7-hydroxylation is deficient, the chances on formation of the hepatotoxic oHPA metabolite will be significantly lower in the liver of humans than those expected in the liver of rats when exposed to a similar dose on a body-weight basis. This conclusion should be taken into account when extrapolating data from experimental studies in sensitive animals, i.e., rats, to the general human population.
19417618	Rifampin greatly reduces the plasma concentrations of intravenous and oral oxycodone. Oxycodone is a mu-opioid receptor agonist that is metabolized mainly in the liver by cytochrome P450 3A and 2D6 enzymes. Rifampin is a strong inducer of several drug-metabolizing enzymes. The authors studied the interaction of rifampin with oxycodone. Their hypothesis was that rifampin enhances the CYP3A-mediated metabolism of oxycodone and attenuates its pharmacologic effect. The protocol was a four-session, paired crossover. Twelve volunteers were given 600 mg oral rifampin or placebo once daily for 7 days. Oxycodone was given on day 6. In the first part of the study, 0.1 mg/kg oxycodone hydrochloride was given intravenously. In the second part of the study, 15 mg oxycodone hydrochloride was given orally. Concentrations of oxycodone and its metabolites noroxycodone, oxymorphone, and noroxymorphone were determined for 48 h. Psychomotor effects were characterized for 12 h by several visual analog scales. Analgesic effects were characterized by measuring the heat pain threshold and cold pain sensitivity. Rifampin decreased the area under the oxycodone concentration-time curve of intravenous and oral oxycodone by 53% and 86%, respectively (P < 0.001). Oral bioavailability of oxycodone was decreased from 69% to 21% (P < 0.001). Rifampin greatly increased the plasma metabolite-to-parent drug ratios for noroxycodone and noroxymorphone (P < 0.001). Pharmacologic effects of oral oxycodone were attenuated. Induction of cytochrome P450 3A by rifampin reduced the area under the oxycodone concentration-time curve of intravenous and oral oxycodone. The pharmacologic effects of oxycodone were modestly attenuated. To maintain adequate analgesia, dose adjustment of oxycodone may be necessary, when used concomitantly with rifampin.
16500065	Determination and pharmacokinetic study of oxymatrine and its metabolite matrine in human plasma by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. There is little information about the pharmacokinetics of oxymatrine (OMT) and its metabolite matrine (MT) after i.v. administration of OMT in human. Therefore a specific and sensitive liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was established for the determination and pharmacokinetic study of OMT and its metabolite MT in human plasma after i.v. infusion administration of 600 mg of OMT in 100 ml of 5% glucose injection in 0.5 h. The analysis was carried out on a Lichrospher-CN column (250 mmx4.6 mm, i.d., 5 microm, Merck) with mobile phase of methanol-ammonium acetate (20 mmol/l; 85:15, v/v) pumped at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The tandem mass detection was made with electrospray ionization in positive ion selected reaction monitoring mode, with argon collision-induced dissociation ion transitions m/z 265.2 to m/z 265.2 for OMT at 25 eV, m/z 249.2 to m/z 249.2 for MT at 25 eV and m/z 340.2 to m/z 324.0 at 35 eV for the internal standard (papaverine), respectively. The assay was validated to be accurate and precise for the analysis in the concentration range of 1.0-40,000 ng/ml for both OMT and MT with the LOD being 0.5 and 0.2 ng/ml, respectively, when 0.25 ml of human plasma sample was processed with papaverine as internal standard. The pharmacokinetic study was made with 10 healthy male Chinese subjects. The plasma concentration time profiles of OMT and MT obtained were best fitted with two-compartment and one-compartment models, respectively. The main pharmacokinetic parameters found for OMT and MT after i.v. infusion were as follows: Cmax (20,519+/-7581) and (247+/-45) ng/ml, Tmax (0.5+/-0.1) and (5.6+/-1.7) h, AUC0-t (20,360+/-5205) and (3817+/-610) ng h/ml, AUC0-infinity (20,436+/-5188) and (3841+/-615) ng h/ml, t1/2 (2.17+/-0.49) and (9.43+/-0.62) h, respectively. The CL/F and Vd/F of OMT were (43.8+/-10.8) l h-1 and (70.1+/-26.6) l, respectively. Therefore only a small amount of OMT was reduced to MT following i.v. administration of OMT judged by the AUCs.
17941060	Identification and human pharmacokinetics of dihydroergotoxine metabolites in man: preliminary results. Dihydroergotoxine is a mixture of semi-synthetic ergot alkaloids mainly used for age-related cognitive impairment. In this study, dihydroergotoxine (30 microM) was added to incubates of rat and bovine liver microsomes, and the resulting major metabolites were identified as hydroxy-dihydroergocornine, hydroxy-dihydroergocryptine and hydroxy-dihydroergocristine on the basis of molecular mass measurements, determined with a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The relevance of these to humans was then investigated by simultaneously monitoring dihydroergotoxine and its hydroxy-metabolites in human plasma by LC-MS/MS after oral dosing of dihydroergotoxine mesylate (27 mg) to a healthy volunteer (male, age 45, height 1.93 m, weight 103 kg). In this preliminary approach, the peaks (C(max)) of dihydroergocornine, dihydroergocryptine and dihydroergocristine were about 0.04 microg/l. The peaks (C(max)) of their hydroxy-metabolites were 0.98, 0.53 and 0.30 microg/l, respectively. In conclusion, in this preliminary approach it was found that hydroxy-dihydroergocornine, hydroxy-dihydroergocryptine and hydroxy-dihydroergocristine were one order of magnitude higher in concentration than their parents in human plasma.
18268081	Safety, tolerance, and pharmacokinetic studies of OPT-80 in healthy volunteers following single and multiple oral doses. Current therapies for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) are encumbered by treatment failures and recurrences. Due to its high in vitro activity against C. difficile but low activity against the typical intestinal flora, minimal absorption, and durable cure in the hamster model of C. difficile infection, OPT-80 was considered for clinical development as a therapy for CDI. This trial consisted of two phases. Four single oral doses of OPT-80 (100, 200, 300, and 450 mg) were administered in a crossover manner to 16 healthy volunteers in a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1A study; a 1- to 2-week washout interval separated the treatments. In the double-blind phase 1B study, 24 healthy subjects were randomized to receive OPT-80 (150, 300, or 450 mg) or placebo for 10 days. In both studies, OPT-80's safety and tolerability were evaluated and the concentrations of OPT-80 and its primary metabolite (OP-1118) in plasma and feces were determined. OPT-80 levels in the urine were also analyzed for the phase 1A study. In both the single-dose and the multiple-dose studies, OPT-80 was well tolerated by all subjects in all dose groups. Maximal plasma concentrations were near or below the limit of quantification (5 ng/ml) across the dose range; urine concentrations were below the detection limit. The fecal total recovery of OPT-80 plus its major metabolite, OP-1118, approximated 100%. The tolerability, high fecal concentration, and low systemic exposure data from these studies support the further clinical development of OPT-80 as an oral therapy for CDI.
16896065	Characterization of ebastine, hydroxyebastine, and carebastine metabolism by human liver microsomes and expressed cytochrome P450 enzymes: major roles for CYP2J2 and CYP3A. Ebastine undergoes extensive metabolism to form desalkylebastine and hydroxyebastine. Hydroxyebastine is subsequently metabolized to carebastine. Although CYP3A4 and CYP2J2 have been implicated in ebastine N-dealkylation and hydroxylation, the enzyme catalyzing the subsequent metabolic steps (conversion of hydroxyebastine to desalkylebastine and carebastine) have not been identified. Therefore, we used human liver microsomes (HLMs) and expressed cytochromes P450 (P450s) to characterize the metabolism of ebastine and that of its metabolites, hydroxyebastine and carebastine. In HLMs, ebastine was metabolized to desalkyl-, hydroxy-, and carebastine; hydroxyebastine to desalkyl- and carebastine; and carebastine to desalkylebastine. Of the 11 cDNA-expressed P450s, CYP3A4 was the main enzyme catalyzing the N-dealkylation of ebastine, hydroxyebastine, and carebastine to desalkylebastine [intrinsic clearance (CL(int)) = 0.44, 1.05, and 0.16 microl/min/pmol P450, respectively]. Ebastine and hydroxyebastine were also dealkylated to desalkylebastine to some extent by CYP3A5. Ebastine hydroxylation to hydroxyebastine is mainly mediated by CYP2J2 (0.45 microl/min/pmol P450; 22.5- and 7.5-fold higher than that for CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, respectively), whereas CYP2J2 and CYP3A4 contributed to the formation of carebastine from hydroxyebastine. These findings were supported by chemical inhibition and kinetic analysis studies in human liver microsomes. The CL(int) of hydroxyebastine was much higher than that of ebastine and carebastine, and carebastine was metabolically more stable than ebastine and hydroxyebastine. In conclusion, our data for the first time, to our knowledge, suggest that both CYP2J2 and CYP3A play important roles in ebastine sequential metabolism: dealkylation of ebastine and its metabolites is mainly catalyzed by CYP3A4, whereas the hydroxylation reactions are preferentially catalyzed by CYP2J2. The present data will be very useful to understand the pharmacokinetics and drug interaction of ebastine in vivo.
12408915	A high performance liquid chromatography method for simultaneous determination of albendazole metabolites in human serum. A simple assay for albendazole (ABZ) main metabolites-albendazole sulphoxide (ABZ-SO), albendazole sulphone (ABZ-SO(2)) and albendazole amino sulphone (ABZ-SO(2)-NH(2))-in serum using high performance liquid chromatography was developed. The method involves liquid-liquid extraction of the serum by ethyl acetate, clean up with n-hexane and re-extraction with ethyl acetate, followed by separation on RP-C(8) column with a mixture of methanol: acetonitrile: acetic acid: water (40:1:10:49) as the eluting solvent. ABZ-SO and mebendazole-used as internal standard-were detected by UV (lambda=286 nm), and ABZ-SO(2) and ABZ-SO(2)-NH(2) with fluorescence spectrophotometer at (Excitation=286 nm, Emission=333 nm) and (Excitation=286 nm, Emission=315 nm), respectively. The assay was accurate and reproducible with a detection limit of 10 ng/ml for ABZ-SO, 2 ng/ml for ABZ-SO(2) and 4 ng/ml for ABZ-SO(2)-NH(2). Disregarding ABZ determination, which is not of pharmacokinetic importance as it is not found in human plasma after oral administration, the proposed method is appropriate for further pharmacokinetic and metabolism study of this drug.
730397	Comparative clinical pharmacology of bacampicillin and high oral doses of ampicillin. Ampicillin is often used in high oral doses due to its incomplete absorption. The objective of this study was to compare the bioavailability of bacampicillin, a new prodrug of ampicillin which is nearly completely absorbed, to that of high doses of oral ampicillin. Single oral doses of bacampicillin 400 mg or 800 mg and ampicillin 500 mg, 1 g, or 2 g were given to 12 male subjects according to a cross-over design after overnight fasting. The median time after administration till the peak serum level was 0.75 and 1.0 hour with bacampicillin 400 mg and 800 mg respectively, as compared to 1.5, 2.0 and 1.5 hours for the ampicillin doses. The mean of the individual peak serum level after bacampicillin 400 mg, was 7.7 mg/l, which is higher than that after ampicillin 500 mg, 5.2 mg/l, and about the same as that after ampicillin 1 g, 7.6 mg/l. A slightly higher mean peak level was seen after bacampicillin 800 mg, 12.2 mg/l, as compared to ampicillin 2 g, 10.5 mg/l. The absorption rate was highest with bacampicillin, for which 90% of the absorption had occurred 1 hour after administration as compared to 2.5 hours after administration of ampicillin. The relative bioavailability was about 2--3 times higher after bacampicillin as compared to ampicillin. The data imply dose-dependent absorption of oral ampicillin in high doses as there seems to be a less than proportional increase in AUC. The urinary recovery after bacampicillin was 68--75% as compared to 25--41% after ampicillin. Higher doses gave a lower percentage recovery and this phenomenon was more pronounced with ampicillin.
14695832	Synthesis, in vitro evaluation, and antileishmanial activity of water-soluble prodrugs of buparvaquone. Water-soluble phosphate prodrugs of buparvaquone (1), containing a hydroxynaphthoquinone structure, were synthesized and evaluated in vitro for improved topical and oral drug delivery against cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis. The successful prodrug synthesis involved a strong base; e.g., sodium hydride. Buparvaquone-3-phosphate (4a) and 3-phosphonooxymethyl-buparvaquone (4b) prodrugs possessed significantly higher aqueous solubilities (>3.5 mg/mL) than the parent drug (</=0.03 microg/mL) over a pH range of 3.0-7.4. Moreover, 4a and 4b maintained adequate lipophilicity as indicated by distribution coefficients (log D) between 0.5 and 3.0 over this pH range. Both 4a and 4b were also shown to be substrates for alkaline phosphatase in vitro and thus are promising bioreversible prodrugs for the improved topical and oral bioavailability of 1. Buparvaquone and its prodrugs showed nanomolar or low-micromolar ED(50) activity values against species that cause cutaneous leishmaniasis, e.g., L. major, L. amazonensis, L. aethiopica, L. mexicana, and L. panamensis and also L. donovani, which is the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis. From these results, the human skin permeation of the prodrugs 4a and 4b were studied in vitro. While no buparvaquone permeated across post mortem skin in vitro during 72 h of experiments, both prodrugs 4a and 4b permeated readily through the skin. In addition, 4b easily released the parent drug in human skin homogenate and, therefore, is a promising prodrug candidate to deliver buparvaquone through the skin for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis.
21646438	Investigations of hydrazine cleavage of eltrombopag in humans. After oral administration to humans, eltrombopag undergoes extensive cleavage of its hydrazine linkage to metabolites, which are exclusively eliminated in urine. In vitro, the cleavage pathway was not detected in systems using cytochrome P450 enzymes, renal or hepatic microsomes, or hepatocytes but was readily evident after anaerobic incubation with rodent cecal contents or human fecal homogenate. Antibiotic treatment in vitro and in vivo inhibited eltrombopag cleavage, further indicating that cleavage is via gut microbes. Antibiotic treatment did not alter the systemic exposure of eltrombopag in mice. Oral and intravenous pharmacokinetic characterization in the mice with one of the cleavage products indicated that it was readily absorbed, conjugated, and eliminated in urine, consistent with its fate after oral administration of eltrombopag. Variation in this microbial pathway, for example by antibiotic cotherapy, is unlikely to be clinically significant.
17536764	Assessment of human exposure to di-isodecyl phthalate using oxidative metabolites as biomarkers. Di-isodecyl phthalate (DiDP), primarily used as a plasticiser, is a mixture of isomers with predominantly ten-carbon branched side chains. Assessment of DiDP exposure has not been conducted before because adequate biomarkers were lacking. In 129 adult volunteers with no known exposure to DiDP, the urinary concentrations of three oxidative metabolites of DiDP: monocarboxyisononyl phthalate (MCiNP), monooxoisodecyl phthalate (MOiDP) and monohydroxyisodecyl phthalate (MHiDP), previously identified in DiDP-dosed rats, were estimated by solid-phase extraction coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) using the respective oxidative metabolites of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate since authentic standards of the DiDP oxidative metabolites were unavailable. Interestingly, the hydrolytic monoester of DiDP, monoisodecyl phthalate (MiDP), was not detected in any of the samples, while MCiNP, MHiDP and MOiDP were detected in 98%, 96% and 85%, respectively, of the samples tested. MCiNP was excreted predominantly in its free form, whereas MOiDP was excreted as its glucuronide. MCiNP, MHiDP and MOiDP eluted as clusters of multiple peaks from the HPLC column probably due to the presence of numerous structurally similar isomers present in commercial DiDP formulations. The urinary concentrations of these oxidative metabolites correlated significantly (p < 0.0001) with each other, thus confirming a common precursor. The urinary concentrations of these DiDP oxidative metabolites also correlated significantly (p < 0.0001) with oxidative metabolites of di-isononyl phthalate (DiNP) suggesting the potential presence of DiNP isomers in commercial DiDP or simultaneous use of DiDP and DiNP in consumer products. The concentrations presented are semiquantitative estimates and should be interpreted cautiously. Nevertheless, the higher frequency of detection and higher urinary concentrations of MCiNP, MHiDP and MOiDP than of MiDP suggest that these oxidative metabolites are better biomarkers for DiDP exposure assessment than MiDP. These data also suggest that unless oxidative metabolites are measured, the prevalence of exposure to DiDP will probably be underestimated.
15470687	Simultaneous determination of niflumic acid and its prodrug, talniflumate in human plasma by high performance liquid chromatography. A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method has been developed for the simultaneous determination of niflumic acid and its prodrug, talniflumate, in human plasma. Niflumic acid and talniflumate were eluted isocratically with methanol-water (73:27, v/v, adjusted to pH 3.5 by acetic acid) at a fl ow rate of 1 mL/min. Indomethacin was used as an internal standard. Signals were monitored by an UV detector at 288 nm. Retention times of indomethacin, niflumic acid and talniflumate were 5.9, 7.2 and 13.5 min, respectively. Calibration plots were linear over the range 50-5000 ng/mL for niflumic acid and 100-5000 ng/mL for talniflumate. The limits of quantitation were 50 ng/mL for niflumic acid and 100 ng/mL for talniflumate. The intra- and inter-day relative standard deviations (RSD) of niflumic acid and talniflumate were less than 10% and the accuracies were higher than 90%. This method is rapid, sensitive and reproducible for the determination of niflumic acid and talniflumate in human plasma.
17646282	In vitro prediction and in vivo verification of enantioselective human tofisopam metabolite profiles. In vitro studies were conducted to elucidate the metabolic profiles of and the enzymes responsible for the metabolism of (R)- and (S)-tofisopam (1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-5-ethyl-7,8-dimethoxy-4-methyl-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine). Large differences were observed between the two enantiomers. The major metabolite in incubations of 500 ng/ml (approximately 1.3 microM) (R)-tofisopam in human liver microsomes corresponded to demethylation of the methoxy group at the 4-position of the phenyl ring (M3). Incubating (R)-tofisopam with recombinant cytochrome P450 (P450) or with human liver microsomes and isoform-selective P450 chemical inhibitors indicated that M3 was primarily catalyzed by CYP2C9. Similar incubations with S-tofisopam indicated that the primary metabolite was due to demethylation of the methoxy group at the 7-position of the benzodiazepine ring (M1), and this reaction was catalyzed primarily by CYP3A4. The primary metabolites of both enantiomers were further demethylated to form a common didemethylated metabolite (M5) where the methoxy groups at positions 4 and 7 are demethylated. Analysis of plasma and urine samples from human clinical trials confirmed the in vitro observations. Subjects orally treated with 200 mg b.i.d. (R)-tofisopam had a 2-h M1/M3 plasma ratio of 1:29 and a ratio of 1:123 in urine, whereas patients orally administered (S)-tofisopam at 150 mg/kg t.i.d. had opposite M1 to M3 ratios of 8:1 in plasma and 6:1 in urine.
22180045	Characterization of hepatic and intestinal glucuronidation of magnolol: application of the relative activity factor approach to decipher the contributions of multiple UDP-glucuronosyltransferase isoforms. Magnolol is a food additive that is often found in mints and gums. Human exposure to this compound can reach a high dose; thus, characterization of magnolol disposition in humans is very important. Previous studies indicated that magnolol can undergo extensive glucuronidation in humans in vivo. In this study, in vitro assays were used to characterize the glucuronidation pathway in human liver and intestine. Assays with recombinant human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzymes (UGTs) revealed that multiple UGT isoforms were involved in magnolol glucuronidation, including UGT1A1, -1A3, -1A7, -1A8, -1A9, -1A10, and -2B7. Magnolol glucuronidation by human liver microsomes (HLM), human intestine microsomes (HIM), and most recombinant UGTs exhibited strong substrate inhibition kinetics. The degree of substrate inhibition was relatively low in the case of UGT1A10, whereas the reaction catalyzed by UGT1A9 followed biphasic kinetics. Chemical inhibition studies and the relative activity factor (RAF) approach were used to identify the individual UGTs that played important roles in magnolol glucuronidation in HLM and HIM. The results indicate that UGT2B7 is mainly responsible for the reaction in HLM, whereas UGT2B7 and UGT1A10 are significant contributors in HIM. In summary, the current study clarifies the glucuronidation pathway of magnolol and demonstrates that the RAF approach can be used as an efficient method for deciphering the roles of individual UGTs in a given glucuronidation pathway in the native tissue that is catalyzed by multiple isoforms with variable and atypical kinetics.
15013842	Uridine diphosphate sugar-selective conjugation of an aldose reductase inhibitor (AS-3201) by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B subfamily in human liver microsomes. N-Glucosidation is known as a major metabolic reaction for barbiturates in humans. However, the enzyme(s) involved in this N-glucosidation has not been clarified yet. Thus, to clarify the enzyme(s) involved in the N-glucosidation in human liver microsomes, we investigated the N-glucosyltransferase activity in recombinant UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) using AS-3201, an aldose reductase inhibitor, as a substrate. AS-3201 was found to be biotransformed to both N-glucoside and N-glucuronide in human liver microsomes. The N-glucosyltransferase activities were detectable with multiple UGT isoforms (UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A4, UGT2B4, UGT2B7, and UGT2B15). In contrast, the N-glucuronyltransferase activities for the same substrate were seen with UGT1A (UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A4, and UGT1A9) but not UGT2B isoforms. We then determined the relative activity factor of each recombinant UGT and estimated the contribution of each UGT isoform to the N-glucosidation in human liver microsomes. The results showed that UGT2B isoforms mainly contribute to AS-3201 N-glucosidation in human liver microsomes. In addition, the activity of AS-3201 N-glucosyltransferase significantly correlated with that of amobarbital N-glucosyltransferase in microsomes from sixteen human livers (r=0.964, P<0.01), indicating that UGT2B isoforms were also involved in the barbiturate N-glucosidation in humans. The findings of this study clearly show that UGT2B specifically utilizes UDP-glucose but not UDP-glucuronic acid as a sugar donor for the conjugation of AS-3201 in human liver microsomes.
19070586	Development of an LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous quantification of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole in human plasma. A selective, sensitive, and accurate liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous determination of aripiprazole and its active metabolite dehydroaripiprazole in human plasma has been developed using papaverine as internal standard (IS). LC-MS/MS analysis was carried out on a Finnigan LC-TSQ Quantum mass spectrometer using positive ion electrospray ionization (ESI(+)) and selected reaction monitoring (SRM). The assays for aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole were linear over the ranges of 0.1 to 600 ng/ml and 0.01 to 60 ng/ml, respectively. The average recoveries in plasma samples both were better than 85%. The intra- and interrun precision and accuracy values were found to be within the assay variability criteria limits according to the US Food and Drug Administration guidelines. The developed method was proved to be suitable for use in a clinical pharmacokinetic study after a single oral administration of a 5-mg aripiprazole tablet in healthy Chinese volunteers.
19066859	Characterization of metabolites of sibutramine in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes by liquid chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry. Liquid chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry was used for the detection and structural characterization of metabolites of the anti-obesity drug sibutramine. Metabolites were profiled from incubations of sibutramine in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes. In addition, enantioselectivity of sibutramine metabolism was investigated by carrying out separate incubations with (R)- and (S)-sibutramine. As a result, biotransformation profile for sibutramine with rat hepatocytes is proposed. Nineteen metabolites and several of their isomers formed via demethylation, hydroxylation, dehydrogenation, acetylation, attachment of CO(2), and glucuronidation were identified in MS(2) and MS(3) experiments, though the exact position of the functionality, mostly hydroxylation, could not always be determined from the mass spectrometric information. However, clear enantioselective formation was observed for two hydroxyl derivatives and two glucuronide conjugates, indicating that the hydroxyl/glucuronic acid moiety in those structures is close to the chiral center. Most of the metabolites found in this study are new metabolites of sibutramine, which were not previously reported.
20176691	Identification and characterization of human UDP-glucuronosyltransferases responsible for the in vitro glucuronidation of daphnetin. Daphnetin has been developed as an oral medicine for treatment of coagulation disorders and rheumatoid arthritis in China, but its in vitro metabolism remains unknown. In the present study, the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) conjugation pathways of daphnetin were characterized. Two metabolites, 7-O-monoglucuronide daphnetin (M-1) and 8-O-monoglucuronide daphnetin (M-2), were identified by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and NMR when daphnetin was incubated, respectively, with liver microsomes from human (HLM), rat (RLM), and minipig (PLM) and human intestinal microsomes (HIM) in the presence of UDP-glucuronic acid. Screening assays with 12 human recombinant UGTs demonstrated that the formations of M-1 and M-2 were almost exclusively catalyzed by UGT1A9 and UGT1A6, whereas M-1 was formed to a minor extent by UGT1A3, 1A4, 1A7, 1A8, and 1A10 at a high substrate concentration. Kinetics studies, chemical inhibition, and correlation analysis were used to demonstrate that human UGT1A9 and UGT1A6 were major isoforms involved in the daphnetin glucuronidations in HLM and HIM. By in vitro-in vivo extrapolation of the kinetic data measured in HLM, the hepatic clearance and the corresponding hepatic extraction ratio were estimated to be 19.3 ml/min/kg b.wt. and 0.93, respectively, suggesting that human clearance of daphnetin via the glucuronidation is extensive. Chemical inhibition of daphnetin glucuronidation in HLM, RLM, and PLM showed large species differences although the metabolites were formed similarly among the species. In conclusion, the UGT conjugation pathways of daphnetin were fully elucidated and its C-8 phenol group was more selectively catalyzed by UGTs than by the C-7 phenol.
19883238	In vitro evidence for the formation of reactive intermediates of resveratrol in human liver microsomes. Resveratrol (3,4',5-trihydroxystilbene) is a naturally occurring polyphenolic compound found in a variety of foods and over-the-counter health products. It has gained wide public use due to its potential health properties, and is available over-the-counter at health product stores. Although the safety profile of resveratrol has been minimally investigated in humans, resveratrol has been associated with observations of toxicity in vitro, and has been identified as a mechanism-based inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4. In addition, resveratrol has been rationally hypothesized to form reactive quinone methide metabolites, despite experimental evidence supporting this assumption. This work evaluates the potential for resveratrol to form glutathione-trapped reactive intermediates in human liver microsomes utilizing liquid chromatography and electrospray tandem mass spectrometry, and has resulted in the identification of several in vitro products including two hydroxylated metabolites (piceatannol and metabolite 2), and two pairs of regioisomeric glutathione adducts. The parallel metabolism of resveratrol to piceatannol and metabolite 2 (a putative quinone methide) are demonstrated to result in the formation of two putative quinone methide intermediates resulting in divergent mechanisms for formation of each pair of regioisomeric glutathione adducts.
23256623	Characterization of in vitro metabolites of luotonin A in human liver microsomes using electrospray/tandem mass spectrometry. 1. The pharmacological activity of luotonin A varies, depending on the type of functional group and the site of derivatization. To understand the in vivo efficacy of luotonin A, the in vitro metabolism of luotonin A was investigated in human liver microsomes and recombinant cDNA-expressed cytochromeP450 (CYP). 2. Incubation of luotonin A with pooled human liver microsomes in the presence of NADPH-generating system resulted in the formation of four metabolites and the structures of each metabolite were tentatively characterized on the basis of electrospray tandem mass spectra. 3. The main metabolic pathway of luotonin A in human liver microsomes was hydroxylation, resulting in the generation of two mono-hydroxyl metabolites (M1 and M2) and two di-hydroxyl metabolites (M3 and M4). CYP1A2 was primarily involved in hydroxylation of the quinolone moiety (M1 and M3), while CYP3A4 was mainly responsible for hydroxylation of the quinazoline moiety of luotonin A (M2 and M4) in human liver microsomes.
15258111	In vitro and in vivo metabolism of a potent and selective integrin alpha v beta 3 antagonist in rats, dogs, and monkeys. Compound A (3-[2-oxo-3-[3-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-[1,8]naphthyrindin-2-yl)propyl]-imidazolidin-1-yl]-3(S)-(6-methoxy-pyridin-3-yl)-propionic acid), a potent and selective antagonist of integrin alpha(v)beta(3) receptor, is under development for treatment of osteoporosis. This study describes metabolism and excretion of A in vivo in rats, dogs, and monkeys, and metabolism of A in vitro in primary hepatocytes from rats, dogs, monkeys, and humans. In all three animal species studied, A was primarily excreted as unchanged drug and, to a lesser degree, as phase I and phase II metabolites. Major biotransformation pathways of A included glucuronidation/glucosylation on the carboxylic group to form acyl-linked glucuronides/glucosides; and oxidation on the tetrahydronaphthyridine moiety to generate a carbinolamine and its further metabolized products. Minor pathways involved O-demethylation and hydroxylations on the alkyl chain. Only in rats, a glutathione adduct of A was also observed, and its formation is proposed to be via an iminium intermediate on the tetrahydronaphthyridine ring. Similar metabolic pathways were observed in the incubates of hepatocytes from the corresponding animals as well as from humans. CYP 3A and 2D subfamilies were capable of metabolizing A to its oxidative products. Overall, these in vitro and in vivo findings should provide useful insight on possible biotransformation pathways of A in humans.
23704698	Glucuronidation of a sarpogrelate active metabolite is mediated by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases 1A4, 1A9, and 2B4. Sarpogrelate is a selective serotonin 5-HT2A-receptor antagonist used to treat patients with peripheral arterial disease. This drug is rapidly hydrolyzed to its main metabolite (R,S)-1-[2-[2-(3-methoxyphenyl)ethyl]phenoxy]-3-(dimethylamino)-2-propanol (M-1), which is mainly excreted as a glucuronide conjugate. Sarpogrelate was also directly glucuronidated to an O-acyl glucuronide and a N-glucuronide by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) in human liver microsomes (HLMs). Since M-1 is pharmacologically more active than sarpogrelate, we examined glucuronidation of this metabolite in HLMs and characterized the UGTs responsible for M-1 glucuronidation. Diastereomers of O-glucuronide (SMG1 and SMG3) and a N-glucuronide (SMG2) were identified by incubation of M-1 with HLMs in the presence of uridine 5'-diphosphoglucuronic acid (UDPGA), and their structures were confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry analyses. Two O-glucuronides were identified as chiral isomers: SMG1 as R-isomer and SMG3 as S-isomer. Using recombinant UGT enzymes, we determined that SMG1 and SMG3 were predominantly catalyzed by UGT1A9 and UGT2B4, respectively, whereas SMG2 was generated by UGT1A4. In addition, significant correlations were noted between the SMG1 formation rate and propofol glucuronidation (a marker reaction of UGT1A9; r = 0.6269, P < 0.0031), and between the SMG2 formation rate and trifluoperazine glucuronidation (a marker reaction of UGT1A4; r = 0.6623, P < 0.0015) in a panel of HLMs. Inhibition of SMG1, SMG2, and SMG3 formation by niflumic acid, hecogenin, and fluconazole further substantiated the involvement of UGT1A9, UGT1A4, and UGT2B4, respectively. These findings collectively indicate that UGT1A4, UGT1A9, and UGT2B4 are the major UGT isoforms responsible for glucuronidation of M-1, an active metabolite of sarpogrelate.
19198839	Inhibition of drug metabolizing cytochrome P450s by the aromatase inhibitor drug letrozole and its major oxidative metabolite 4,4'-methanol-bisbenzonitrile in vitro. To determine the inhibitory potency of letrozole and its main human metabolite, 4,4'-methanol-bisbenzonitrile, on the activities of eight cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Letrozole and its metabolite were incubated with human liver microsomes (HLMs) (or expressed CYP isoforms) and NADPH in the absence (control) and presence of the test inhibitor. Letrozole was a potent competitive inhibitor of CYP2A6 (K (i) 4.6 +/- 0.05 microM and 5.0 +/- 2.4 microM in HLMs and CYP2A6, respectively) and a weak inhibitor of CYP2C19 (K (i) 42.2 microM in HLMs and 33.3 microM in CYP2C19), while its metabolite showed moderate inhibition of CYP2C19 and CYP2B6. Letrozole or its metabolite had negligible effect on other CYPs. Based on the in vitro K (i) values, letrozole is predicted to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2A6 in vivo. Letrozole and its major human metabolite show inhibitory activity towards other CYPs, but clinically relevant drug interactions seem less likely as the K (i) values are above the therapeutic plasma concentrations of letrozole.
16455059	The effect of methadone and buprenorphine on human placental aromatase. Methadone and buprenorphine (BUP) are used for treatment of the pregnant opiate addict. CYP19/aromatase is the major placental enzyme responsible for the metabolism of methadone to 2-ethylidine-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP) and BUP to norbuprenorphine (norBUP). The aim of this investigation was to determine the effects of methadone and BUP on the activity of placental microsomal aromatase in the conversion of its endogenous substrates testosterone to 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) and 16alpha-hydroxytestosterone (16-OHT) to estriol (E(3)). The conversion of testosterone and 16-OHT by human placental microsomes exhibited saturation kinetics, and the apparent K(m) values were 0.2 +/- 1 and 6 +/- 3 microM, respectively. V(max) values for E(2) and E(3) formation were 70 +/- 16 and 28 +/- 10 pmol/mg proteinmin, respectively. Also, data obtained revealed that methadone and BUP are competitive inhibitors of testosterone conversion to E(2) and 16-OHT to E(3). The K(i) for methadone inhibition of E(2) and E(3) formation were 393 +/-144 and 53 +/- 28 microM, respectively, and for BUP the K(i) was 36 +/- 9 and 6 +/- 1 microM. The higher potency of the two opiates and their metabolites in inhibiting E(3) formation is in agreement with the lower affinity of 16-OHT than testosterone to aromatase. Moreover, the metabolites EDDP and norBUP were weaker inhibitors of aromatase than their parent compounds. The determined inhibition constants of methadone and BUP for E(3) formation by a cDNA-expressed CYP19 preparation were similar to those for placental microsomes. Therefore, data reported here suggest that methadone, BUP, and their metabolites are inhibitors of androgen aromatization in the placental biosynthesis of estrogens.
24167220	Selective inhibition of cytochrome P450 2D6 by Sarpogrelate and its active metabolite, M-1, in human liver microsomes. The present study was performed to evaluate the in vitro inhibitory potential of sarpogrelate and its active metabolite, M-1, on the activities of nine human cytochrome (CYP) isoforms. Using a cocktail assay, the effects of sarpogrelate on nine CYP isoforms and M-1 were measured by specific marker reactions in human liver microsomes. Sarpogrelate potently and selectively inhibited CYP2D6-mediated dextromethorphan O-demethylation with an IC50 (Ki) value of 3.05 μM (1.24 μM), in a competitive manner. M-1 also markedly inhibited CYP2D6 activity; its inhibitory effect with an IC50 (Ki) value of 0.201 μM (0.120 μM) was more potent than that of sarpogrelate, and was similarly potent as quinidine (Ki, 0.129 μM), a well-known typical CYP2D6 inhibitor. In addition, sarpogrelate and M-1 strongly inhibited both CYP2D6-catalyzed bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation and metoprolol α-hydroxylation activities. However, sarpogrelate and M-1 showed no apparent inhibition of the other following eight CYPs: CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4/5. Upon 30-minute preincubation of human liver microsomes with sarpogrelate or M-1 in the presence of NADPH, no obvious shift in IC50 was observed in terms of inhibition of the nine CYP activities, suggesting that sarpogrelate and M-1 are not time-dependent inactivators. Sarpogrelate strongly inhibited the activity of CYP2D6 at clinically relevant concentrations in human liver microsomes. These observations suggest that sarpogrelate could have an effect on the metabolic clearance of drugs possessing CYP2D6-catalyzed metabolism as a major clearance pathway, thereby eliciting pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions.
22582265	The identification of the urinary metabolites of 3-(4-methoxybenzoyl)-1-pentylindole (RCS-4), a novel cannabimimetic, by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. 3-(4-Methoxybenzoyl)-1-pentylindole (RCS-4), a synthetic indole-derived cannabimimetic, was first reported to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction via the Early Warning System by Hungarian authorities in 2010 and later identified in head shop test purchases in Ireland. Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, we have identified a series of RCS-4 metabolites in urine samples from individuals admitted to hospitals with symptoms of drug intoxication. The metabolites were tentatively identified as products of (i) aromatic monohydroxylation; (ii) dihydroxylation; (iii) aromatic hydroxylation/oxidation of the N-pentyl chain to a ketone; (iv) O-demethylation; (v) O-demethylation/monohydroxylation of N-pentyl chain; (vi) O-demethylation/oxidation of the N-pentyl chain to a ketone; (vii) O-demethylation/aromatic hydroxylation/oxidation of the N-pentyl chain to a ketone; (viii) N-depentylation/aromatic monohydroxylation; and (ix) N and O-dealkylation. The parent compound was not detected. The O-demethylated metabolites were found to be the most useful metabolic markers for the identification of RCS-4 ingestion.
2871781	Clinical pharmacokinetics and metabolism of bevantolol. Bevantolol (the hydrochloride salt) has pharmacokinetic properties that are clinically advantageous. Bevantolol is well absorbed orally (greater than 70%); and the systemic bioavailability is 60%. Peak plasma concentrations are achieved 1 to 2 hours following an oral dose. Elimination is first-order with an average elimination half-life of 1.5 hours. Bevantolol exhibits linear pharmacokinetics within the therapeutic range (100 to 400 mg) with no change in half-life with chronic dosing. These properties result in predictable plasma levels and predictable drug response.
21990013	Simultaneous determination of prochlorperazine and its metabolites in human plasma using isocratic liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Oral prochlorperazine (PCZ), an antiemetic, undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. The study developed a simultaneous analytical method for PCZ and its major metabolites, prochlorperazine sulfoxide (PCZSO), N-demethylprochlorperazine (NDPCZ) and 7-hydroxyprochlorperazine (PCZOH), in human plasma using an isocratic liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. Deproteinized plasma specimens were separated using a 3 µm particle size octadecylsilyl column, and the run time was 10 min. The calibration curves were linear over the concentration ranges of 0.01-40 µg/L for PCZ, NDPCZ and PCZOH, and 0.05-80 µg/L for PCZSO. The intra- and inter-assay precisions and accuracies were within 7.0 and 99-104% and within 9.0 and 99-105%, respectively. The lower limits of quantification in human plasma were 10 ng/L for PCZ, NDPCZ and PCZOH, and 50 ng/L for PCZSO. The validated method was applied to the determination of plasma samples in 37 cancer patients receiving PCZ. Large interindividual variations were observed in plasma concentrations of PCZ, PCZSO, NDPCZ and PCZOH (relative standard deviation, 89.4, 88.7, 86.4 and 78.2%, respectively). In conclusion, this simultaneous LC-MS/MS method with acceptable analytical performance can be helpful for evaluating the pharmacokinetics of PCZ, including the determination of its metabolites in cancer patients and in clinical research.
17289327	Simultaneous and rapid quantitation of benazepril and benazeprilat in human plasma by high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. A sensitive and accurate high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with ultraviolet (UV) detector was developed and validated for simultaneous determination of benazepril (BZL) and its active metabolite, benazeprilat (BZT), in human plasma. The plasma sample, after spiked with riluzole as an internal standard (IS), was subjected to a solid-phase extraction (SPE) prior to a HPLC analysis. Chromatographic separations were achieved on a Hypersil BDS C(18) (300 mm x 4.6mm, 5 microm). The mobile phase consisted of phosphate buffer (pH 2.6; 10mM) and acetonitrile mixture in a gradient mode. Detection was carried out at a wavelength of 237 nm. The retention times of BZL, BZT and IS were at about 6.2, 15.4 and 16.2 min, respectively. The calibration curve was linear in the range of 20-2000 ng/mL for both BZL and BZT (r(2)>0.997). At three quality control concentrations of 100, 500, and 1500 ng/mL, the intra-day and inter-day relative standard deviation ranged from 2.8 to 8.6% for BZL and from 2.2 to 8.5% for BZT, while the mean absolute percentage error ranged from -7.5 to 6.7% for BZL and from -6.0 to 3.2% for BZT. The limit of detection (LOD) was 10 ng/mL and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 20 ng/mL for both BZL and BZT in human plasma. The method was successfully applied to bioequivalence evaluation of benazepril hydrochloride formulations in healthy Chinese.
9029745	Increases in plasma concentration of m-chlorophenylpiperazine, but not trazodone, with low-dose haloperidol. Our previous study suggested that cytochrome P4502D6 (CYP2D6) is involved in the metabolism of trazodone and its active metabolite, m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP). The purpose of this study was to examine the degrees of increase in plasma concentrations of trazodone and m-CPP induced by haloperidol, which is an inhibitor of CYP2D6. The subjects were nine depressed inpatients receiving trazodone at bedtime (150 mg in seven patients and 300 mg in two) for 2-19 weeks. Haloperidol at 4 mg/day was coadministered for 1 week, and blood samplings were taken before and after the coadministration. Contrary to our expectation, haloperidol did not significantly increase the mean plasma trazodone concentration (810 +/- 382 vs. 856 +/- 357 ng/ml). However, haloperidol significantly increased (p < 0.01) the mean plasma m-CPP concentration (78 +/- 31 vs. 92 +/- 34 ng/ml).
17343829	Glucuronidation of fenamates: kinetic studies using human kidney cortical microsomes and recombinant UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A9 and 2B7. Mefenamic acid, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is used commonly to treat menorrhagia. This study investigated the glucuronidation kinetics of flufenamic, mefenamic and niflumic acid using human kidney cortical microsomes (HKCM) and recombinant UGT1A9 and UGT2B7. Using HKCM Michaelis-Menten (MM) kinetics were observed for mefenamic (K(m)(app) 23 microM) and niflumic acid (K(m)(app) 123 microM) glucuronidation, while flufenamic acid exhibited non-hyperbolic (atypical) glucuronidation kinetics. Notably, the intrinsic renal clearance of mefenamic acid (CL(int) 17+/-5.5 microL/minmg protein) was fifteen fold higher than that of niflumic acid (CL(int) 1.1+/-0.8 microL/minmg protein). These data suggest that renal glucuronidation of mefenamic acid may result in high intrarenal exposure to mefenamic acyl-glucuronide and subsequent binding to renal proteins. Diverse kinetics were observed for fenamate glucuronidation by UGT2B7 and UGT1A9. Using UGT2B7 MM kinetics were observed for flufenamic (K(m)(app) 48 microM) and niflumic acid (K(m)(app) 135 microM) glucuronidation and atypical kinetics with mefenamic acid. Similarity in K(m)(app) between HKCM and UGT2B7 suggests that UGT2B7 may be the predominant renal UGT isoform catalysing niflumic acid glucuronidation. In contrast, UGT1A9 glucuronidation kinetics were characterised by negative cooperativity with mefenamic (S(50) 449 microM, h 0.4) and niflumic acid (S(50) 7344 microM, h 0.4) while atypical kinetics were observed with flufenamic acid. Additionally, potent inhibition of the renal glucuronidation of the UGT substrate 'probe' 4-methylumbelliferone by flufenamic, mefenamic and niflumic acid was observed. These data suggest that inhibitory metabolic interactions may occur between fenamates and other substrates metabolised by UGT2B7 and UGT1A9 in human kidney.
12458675	Enhanced permeability of the antimicrobial agent 2,5-bis(4-amidinophenyl)furan across Caco-2 cell monolayers via its methylamidoidme prodrug. DB75 [2.5-bis(4-amidinophenyl)furan] is a promising antimicrobial agent although it has poor oral potency. In contrast, its novel prodrug, 2,5-bis(4-amidinophenyl)furan-bis-O-methylamidoxime (DB289). has excellent oral potency. The mechanisms of transport of DB289 and DB75 across intestinal epithelium have been investigated in these studies to understand differences in their oral potency. Caco-2 cell monolayers were used as an in vitro model to examine the mechanisms of transport of DB289 and DB75. Samples collected from the transport studies were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet and fluorescence detection. A low permeability coefficient (3.8 x 10(-7) cm/s for transport in apical [AP] to basolateral [BL] direction) and high sensitivity to extracellular Ca2+ suggest that AP to BL transport of DB75 across Caco-2 cell monolayers occurs predominantly via a paracellular route. DB289 has an 85-fold higher transport rate (322.0 x 10(-7) cm/s for transport in the AP to BL direction) across Caco-2 monolayers than that of DB75. This, with its insensitivity to extracellular Ca2+ indicates that AP to BL transport of DB289 across Caco-2 cell monolayers occurs predominantly via a transcellular route. DB75 is transported across Caco-2 cell monolayers predominantly via paracellular pathways, whereas the prodrug DB289 is transported via transcellular pathways. This could account for the much higher oral activity of DB289 over DB75.
2874572	1-(2-Pyrimidinyl)-piperazine as active metabolite of buspirone in man and rat. Buspirone (BP), a newly developed antianxiety agent, forms 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)-piperazine (PmP) during its biotransformation in rats and man. After oral administration of pharmacologically effective doses of BP-hydrochloride to rats (1 and 10 mg/kg), the metabolite appears in significant amounts in body fluids and tissues; it is highly concentrated in the central nervous system, the brain-to-plasma concentration ratios being approximately 5 at the time of the maximum concentrations (Cmax). In man given the anxiolytic dose (20 mg) of BP the metabolite reaches higher plasma Cmax values than its parent drug. Its plasma elimination t1/2 is more than double that for BP. These results, together with the fact that PmP is biochemically and pharmacologically active, suggest that the metabolite may contribute significantly to the central effects of the parent drug.
18048073	Central role of mitochondria and p53 in PUVA-induced apoptosis in human keratinocytes cell line NCTC-2544. Despite strong evidence concerning the high efficiency of PUVA therapy (psoralen plus UVA light), its mechanism of action has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we have evaluated in a cell line of human keratinocytes (NCTC-2544) the effects of two linear psoralen derivatives, 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) and 5-methoxypsoralen (5-MOP), that are widely used in PUVA therapy and two angular derivatives, Angelicin (ANG) and 4,6,4'-trymetyl angelicin (TMA). All derivatives photoinduce cellular death, TMA being the most active compound. The cell cycle analysis showed that the four derivatives induce, 24 h after irradiation, a cell cycle arrest in G1 phase later followed by massive apoptosis. The G1 arrest is correlated to an increase in the expression of p21(Waf1/Cip1), a protein associated with the cell cycle block and apoptosis. Furthermore, treatment of NCTC-2544 resulted in p53 activation by 5-MOP, 8-MOP, and ANG but not TMA and its phosphorylation at serine-15. The levels of p21(Waf1/Cip1) paralleled p53 protein staining pattern suggesting that p53 activation correlated with p21(Waf1/Cip1) induction. Simultaneous to p53 activation, psoralens induced mitochondrial depolarization, cytochrome c release, mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species, as well as caspase-3 and -9 activation. Thus these results strongly indicate the necessity of p53 activation and the induction of the apoptotic machinery downstream of mitochondria.
15561837	Metabolism of the anti-hepatitis C virus nucleoside beta-D-N4-hydroxycytidine in different liver cells. Beta-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC) was found to have selective anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) activity in the HCV replicon system (clone A). The intracellular metabolism of tritiated NHC was investigated in the HCV replicon system, Huh-7 cells, HepG2 cells, and primary human hepatocytes. Incubation of cells with 10 microM radiolabeled NHC demonstrated extensive and rapid phosphorylation in all liver cells. Besides the 5'-mono, -di-, and -triphosphate metabolites of NHC, other metabolites were characterized. These included cytidine and uridine mono-, di-, and triphosphates. UTP was the predominant early metabolite in Huh-7 cells and primary human hepatocytes, suggesting deamination of NHC as the primary catabolic pathway. The intracellular half-lives of radiolabeled NHC-triphosphate and of CTP and UTP derived from NHC incubation in Huh-7 cells were calculated to be 3.0 +/- 1.3, 10.4 +/- 3.3, and 13.2 +/- 3.5 h (means +/- standard deviations), respectively. Studies using monkey and human whole blood demonstrated more-rapid deamination and oxidation in monkey cells than in human cells, suggesting that NHC may not persist long enough in plasma to be delivered to liver cells.
15934038	Electrospray tandem mass spectrometric analysis of zeaxanthin and its oxidation products. Carotenoids have been implicated in protection of the eye from light-mediated photo-toxicity caused by free radicals. Under conditions of normal oxidative stress the carotenoids serve as protective antioxidants; however, when the oxidative stress exceeds the antioxidant capacity, carotenoids can be oxidized into numerous cleavage products. The determination and identification of oxidized carotenoids in biological samples remains a major challenge due to the small sample size and low stability of these compounds. We investigated the reaction of various zeaxanthin cleavage products with O-ethyl hydroxylamine to evaluate their levels in a biological sample. For this, a sensitive and specific electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) was developed, avoiding the classical lower sensitive and specific HPLC-UV and fluorescence absorption methods. Protonated molecules [M + H](+) of carotenoids upon collision-induced dissociation produced a number of structurally characteristic product ions. A series of complicated clusters of product ions differing in 14 (CH(2))and 26 (C(2)H(2))Da was characteristic of the polyene chain of intact carotenoids. All carotenoid ethyl oximes of zeaxanthin cleavage products were characterized by the losses of 60 and 61 Da in their MS/MS spectra. Through the application of the LC/MS/MS method, we identified two oxime derivatives of 3-hydroxy-beta-ionone and 3-hydroxy-14'-apocarotenal with protonated molecules at m/z 252 and m/z 370 respectively, in a human eye sample.
7354440	Tocainide conjugation in humans: novel biotransformation pathway for a primary amine. The metabolism of tocainide, an experimental antiarrhythmic drug, was studied in humans. Urinary excretion of unchanged drug was 28-55% in 24 hr after oral dosing. Urine hydrolysis with hydrochloric acid or beta-glucuronidase increased tocainide recovery to 55-79%. Saccharo-1,4-lactone inhibited the beta-glucuronidase-mediated tocainide recovery increase. Adjustment of urine to pH 13 produced a compound identified as 3-(2,6-xylyl)-5-methylhydantoin. Evidence suggests that it was derived from the same metabolite that formed the additional tocainide after acid or beta-glucuronidase treatment. Tocainide carbamoyl O-beta-D-glucuronide is the structure proposed for the metabolite. The suggested pathway for its formation involves the addition of carbon dioxide to the amino nitrogen of tocainide followed by uridine diphosphate-glucuronic acid conjugation.
22065349	Qualitative studies on the metabolism and the toxicological detection of the fentanyl-derived designer drugs 3-methylfentanyl and isofentanyl in rats using liquid chromatography-linear ion trap-mass spectrometry (LC-MS(n)). The opioid 3-methylfentanyl, a designer drug of the fentanyl type, was scheduled by the Controlled Substance Act due to its high potency and abuse potential. To overcome this regulation, isofentanyl, another designer fentanyl, was synthesized in a clandestine laboratory and seized by the German police. The aims of the presented study were to identify the phase I and phase II metabolites of 3-methylfentanyl and isofentanyl in rat urine, to identify the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes involved in their initial metabolic steps, and, finally, to test their detectability in urine. Using liquid chromatography (LC)-linear ion trap-mass spectrometry (MS(n)), nine phase I and five phase II metabolites of 3-methylfentanyl and 11 phase I and four phase II metabolites of isofentanyl could be identified. The following metabolic steps could be postulated for both drugs: N-dealkylation followed by hydroxylation of the alkyl and aryl moiety, hydroxylation of the propanamide side chain followed by oxidation to the corresponding carboxylic acid, and, finally, hydroxylation of the benzyl moiety followed by methylation. In addition, N-oxidation of isofentanyl could also be observed. All hydroxy metabolites were partly excreted as glucuronides. Using recombinant human isoenzymes, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 were found to be involved in the initial metabolic steps. Our LC-MS(n) screening approach allowed the detection of 0.01 mg/L of 3-methylfentanyl and isofentanyl in spiked urine. However, in urine of rats after the administration of suspected recreational doses, the parent drugs could not be detected, but their common nor metabolite, which should therefore be the target for urine screening.
11393588	Effects of genetic polymorphism of CYP1A2 inducibility on the steady-state plasma concentrations of trazodone and its active metabolite m-chlorophenylpiperazine in depressed Japanese patients. The effects of a genetic polymorphism of inducibility of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 on the steady-state plasma concentrations of trazodone and its active metabolite, m-chlorophenylpiperazine, were studied in order to clarify if these steady-state plasma concentrations are dependent on the CYP1A2 polymorphism. Fifty-eight Japanese depressed patients received trazodone 150 mg/day at bedtime. The steady-state plasma concentrations of trazodone and m-chlorophenylpiperazine were measured in duplicate using high performance liquid chromatographic method, and were corrected to the mean body weight for analyses. A point mutation from guanine (wild type) to adenine (mutated type) at position -2964 in the 5'-flanking region of CYP1A2 gene was identified by polymerase chain reaction fragment length polymorphism method. The mean steady-state plasma concentration of trazodone, but not m-chlorophenylpiperazine was significantly (P<0.05) lower in smokers than in non-smokers. Twenty-two smokers had 16 homozygotes of the wild type allele, 5 heterozygotes of the wild type and mutated alleles, and one homozygote of the mutated allele. There was no significant difference in the mean steady-state plasma concentration of trazodone or m-chlorophenylpiperazine between smokers with no mutation and those with mutation, although one homozygote of the mutated allele had the highest steady-state plasma concentration of trazodone in smokers. The present study thus suggests that CYP1A2 polymorphism does not necessarily have predictive value of the steady-state plasma concentration of trazodone or m-chlorophenylpiperazine in most of the smokers treated with trazodone.
18793575	Influence of food intake on the pharmacokinetics of avosentan in man. Avosentan is a potent, selective endothelin A receptor blocker. The effect of food intake on the pharmacokinetics of avosentan was investigated in healthy volunteers. In a randomized, open-label, 2-period oral crossover study, 12 healthy subjects (8 males and 4 females) received Treatments A and B. Treatment A consisted of a single dose of avosentan 50 mg after a high-fat, high-calorie breakfast. Treatment B consisted of a single dose of avosentan 50 mg administered in the fasted state. Plasma concentrations of avosentan and its hydroxymethyl metabolite Ro 68-5925 were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The overall exposure to avosentan and its metabolite, as reflected by the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC0-inf), was not affected by food intake. The ratios of least square means (90% confidence interval (CI)) of AUC0-inf for avosentan and Ro 68-5925 in the fed and fasted state were 1.06 (0.96, 1.17) and 1.05 (0.96, 1.15), respectively. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of avosentan and its metabolite was increased by food intake, and their apparent terminal half-life (t1/2) was shortened. The ratios of least square means (90% CI) of pharmacokinetic parameters for avosentan and its metabolite in the fed and fasted state were Cmax 1.61 (1.37, 1.90) and 1.46 (1.27, 1.67), and t1/2; 0.80 (0.69, 0.92) and 0.61 (0.51, 0.74), respectively. Single oral doses of avosentan were well tolerated under fasted and fed conditions. Food intake does not influence the pharmacokinetics of avosentan to a clinically relevant extent.
477714	Excretion of hydroflumethiazide in bile and urine of man. Biliary and urinary excretion of hydroflumethiazide (HFT) and its metabolite, 2,4-disulfamyl-5-trifluoromethylaniline (DTA), was investigated in 5 otherwise healthy patients with a T-drain in the common bile duct after cholecystectomy and choledochotomy. After a single oral dose of HFT 302--453 micromoles, a mean of 0.051% (range 0.028--0.075) of the dose was excreted in bile and 34.9% (range 23.7--45.4) in urine during the first 6 hours after administration. Biliary excretion appeared to be of minor importance in the elimination of HFT by man. DTA could not be detected in bile.
12492607	Quinine pharmacokinetics in chronic haemodialysis patients. Quinine is often used to prevent muscle cramps in patients with chronic renal failure. A standard dose of 300 mg at bedtime is usually recommended, but little is known about the pharmacokinetics of quinine in the presence of renal failure. We studied the pharmacokinetics of quinine in eight normal subjects and eight patients with chronic renal failure on haemodialysis after a single oral dose of quinine sulphate (300 mg). The concentration of alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AAG), the major binding protein for quinine, was increased in haemodialysis patients compared with control subjects (1.52 g l-1 vs 0.63 g l-1 [mean difference 1.033; 95% CI 0.735, 1.330]) whereas albumin levels were decreased (30 g l-1 vs 40 g l-1 [mean difference 9.5; 95% CI 3.048, 15.952]). Accordingly, the free fraction of quinine was decreased (0.024 vs 0.063 [mean difference 0.0380; 95% CI 0.0221, 0.0539]) and the apparent volume of distribution tended to decrease (0.95 l kg-1 vs 1.43 l kg-1 [mean difference 0.480; 95% CI 0.193, 1.154]). The quinine binding ratio correlated with the plasma concentration of AAG but not that of albumin. The clearance of free (unbound) quinine was increased in haemodialysis patients compared with controls (67.9 ml min-1 kg-1 vs 41.1 ml min-1 kg-1 [mean difference -26.8; 95% CI, -56.994, 3.469]), and the area under the curve (AUC) of the two main metabolites, 3-hydroxyquinine and 10,11-dihydroxydihydroquinine were increased. In patients with chronic renal failure, there is an increase in plasma protein binding and in the clearance of free drug, resulting in lower plasma concentration of free quinine.
22037879	Pharmacokinetics, metabolism and excretion of [(14)C]-lenalidomide following oral administration in healthy male subjects. Assessment of the absorption, metabolism and excretion of [(14)C]-lenalidomide in healthy male subjects following a single oral dose. Six healthy male subjects were administered a single 25 mg oral suspension dose of [(14)C]-lenalidomide. Blood (plasma), semen and excreta were collected. Mass balance assessments were done by radioactivity measurements. Metabolite profiling and quantitation were accomplished using liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric and radiochemical detection. [(14)C]-Lenalidomide was rapidly absorbed (T (max) 0.77-1.0 h), and the levels declined with a terminal half-life of approximately 3 h, with similar profiles for total blood and plasma radioactivity as well as plasma lenalidomide. The whole blood to plasma radioactivity exposure levels were comparable, suggesting equal distribution between plasma and blood cells. On average, 94% of the administered radioactivity was recovered within 10 days, with >88% recovered within 24 h. Urinary excretion was the primary route of elimination (90% of radioactive dose), with minor amounts excreted in feces (4%). Semen contained a small amount of the radioactive dose (0.0062%). Lenalidomide was the primary radioactive component in plasma (92% of the [(14)C]-area under the concentration-time curve) and urine (>90% of the radioactivity in urine). The remaining radioactivity was composed of primarily two metabolites: 5-hydroxy-lenalidomide and N-acetyl-lenalidomide, each accounting for less than 5% of the total radioactivity as well as lenalidomide levels in plasma and excreta. In summary, following oral administration, lenalidomide is highly absorbed and bioavailable, metabolized minimally, and eliminated predominantly via urinary excretion in the unchanged form in humans.
3780820	2-Mercaptopropionate, a novel metabolite formed during treatment with 2-mercaptopropionyl-glycine in cystinuria. A new acid thiol, 2-mercaptopropionate, has been identified by GC-MS in urine from cystinuric patients on treatment with 2-mercaptopropionylglycine. The amount excreted was 50-300 mumol/24h and it was correlated with the oral dose of 2-mercaptopropionyl-glycine. The observation may be of clinical importance as the metabolite could be a potential hazard in oxidation of fatty acids.
19775091	Human liver microsomal metabolism of (+)-discodermolide. The polyketide natural product (+)-discodermolide is a potent microtubule stabilizer that has generated considerable interest in its synthetic, medicinal, and biological chemistry. It progressed to early clinical oncology trials, where it showed some efficacy in terms of disease stabilization but also some indications of causing pneumotoxicity. Remarkably, there are no reports of its metabolism. Here, we examined its fate in mixed human liver microsomes. Due to limited availability of the agent, we chose a nanoflow liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry analytical approach employing quadrupolar ion trap and quadrupole-quadrupole-time-of-flight instruments for these studies. (+)-Discodermolide was rapidly converted to eight metabolites, with the left-side lactone (net oxidation) and the right-side diene (epoxidation followed by hydrolysis, along with an oxygen insertion product) being the most metabolically labile sites. Other sites of metabolism were the allylic and pendant methyl moieties in the C12-C14 region of the molecule. The results provide information on the metabolic soft spots of the molecule and can be used in further medicinal chemistry efforts to optimize discodermolide analogues.
35204	Kinetics and metabolism of clobazam in animals and man. <b>1</b> The pharmacokinetic behaviour of the psychotropic drug clobazam, a 1,5 benzodiazepine, and its metabolism were studied with the <sup>14</sup>C-labelled compound in rats, dogs, monkeys and man. The absorption was practically complete in all three animal species. Clobazam was not excreted in the unchanged form by all species. The main metabolite in plasma of monkeys, dogs and man was <i>N</i>-demethylclobazam. The metabolites were partially in the conjugated form. <b>2</b> The binding to serum proteins (concentration range 0.05-10 μg/ml serum) amounted to between 66% (in rats) and 85% (in man). The maximal levels of total radioactivity (original compound and metabolites) in blood were 0.24 ± 0.043 μg Equ/ml (2-4 h) in doses and 0.67-0.82 μg Equ/ml (0.5-1 h) in rhesus monkeys. These levels were markedly higher than those in rats with values of 0.064 ± 0.012 μg Equ/ml (∼0.5 h). The elimination of radioactivity from blood occurred in two phases. <b>3</b> After repeated daily administration of oral doses, the 24-h blood levels accumulated in rats to about three times the initial value. In dogs the 24-h serum concentrations remained practically unchanged. Long-term treatment with clobazam in monkeys neither caused enzyme induction nor other processes retarding metabolism and elimination. <b>4</b> Both after a single oral and intravenous dose, more than two-thirds of the radioactivity administered to rats was excreted with the <i>faeces.</i> Dogs, however, excreted about three-quarters of the radioactivity with the <i>urine,</i> irrespective of the route of administration. In monkeys, the excretion also occurred mainly in the urine. In all three species, <i>renal</i> excretion was similarly rapid to that from blood or plasma. <b>5</b> Apart from gastro-intestinal tract, liver and kidneys, the distribution in rats and dogs was remarkably even within the range of maximal blood levels. In the rat brain, the concentration amounted to only one-third of that in the blood. Special accumulations were not found. In dogs, the concentration in the brain was as high as that in the blood. <b>6</b> In rats, kinetics and metabolism were not significantly changed by pregnancy. <b>7</b> For metabolism studies in the four species (man, monkey, dog and rat) urine and faeces (and in some cases also serum) were examined after a single dose or repeated administration. The number and kind of metabolites detected in the individual species were partially different. In autoradiographic studies, exceptionally up to 14 radioactive spots were found for clobazam. <b>8</b> The structures of the metabolites were elucidated by independent methods, mainly mass spectrometry. In addition to the original substance, eight metabolites were identified for clobazam amounting to 70-90% of the total number of metabolites, depending on the species. The two most important chemical changes of clobazam during metabolism are dealkylation and hydroxylation. Dealkylation at nitrogen-(1), particularly pronounced in the species dog, does not differ between the 1,4- and 1,5-benzodiazepines. The difference in metabolism is only pronounced in oxidative decomposition. <b>9</b> In contrast to diazepam, the 4′ position of the phenyl ring of clobazam seems to be particularly favourable for introduction of a hydroxyl function. In dogs, hydroxylation at the 9 position plays an additional important role. It results in the formation of the metabolite 9-hydroxy-<i>N</i>-demethylclobazam by which this species is markedly distinguished from the other three species. It is remarkable that clobazam is not hydroxylated at the 3-position. This is obviously a characteristic of the 1,5-benzodiazepines and helps to distinguish them from the 1,4-benzodiazepines such as diazepam.
17576809	Identification of rat and human cytochrome p450 isoforms and a rat serum esterase that metabolize the pyrethroid insecticides deltamethrin and esfenvalerate. The metabolism of (alphaS)-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl (1R, 3R)-cis-3-(2,2-dibromovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane carboxylate (deltamethrin) and (alphaS)-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl 2-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-methylbutyrate (esfenvalerate) by rat and human liver microsomes differs with respect to the biotransformation pathway (oxidation versus hydrolysis) responsible for their clearance. This study aims to further explore the species differences in the metabolism of these chemicals. Using a parent depletion approach, rat and human cytochromes P450 (P450s) were screened for their ability to eliminate deltamethrin or esfenvalerate during in vitro incubations. Rat P450 isoforms CYP1A1, CYP2C6, CYP2C11, and CYP3A2 and human P450 isoforms CYP2C8, CYP2C19, and CYP3A5 were capable of metabolizing either pyrethroid. Human CYP2C9 metabolized esfenvalerate but not deltamethrin. Rat and human P450s that metabolize esfenvalerate and deltamethrin do so with similar kinetics. In addition to the liver, a potential site of metabolic elimination of pyrethroids is the blood via serum carboxylesterase (CE) hydrolysis. The serum of rats, but not humans, contains significant quantities of CE. Deltamethrin and esfenvalerate were metabolized effectively by rat serum and a purified rat serum CE. In contrast, neither pyrethroid was metabolized by human serum or purified human serum esterases (acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase). These studies suggest that the difference in rates of oxidative metabolism of pyrethroids by rat and human hepatic microsomes is dependent on the expression levels of individual P450 isoforms rather than their specific activity. Furthermore, these studies show that the metabolic elimination of deltamethrin and esfenvalerate in blood may be important to their disposition in rats but not in humans.
12260	Methods for study of fluphenazine kinetics in man. Fluphenazine and its principal metabolites, fluphenazine sulphoxide, and 7-hydroxyfluphenazine were identified and quantified in human plasma, urine and faeces following intramuscular and oral administration of 14C-fluphenazine dihydrochloride. The presence of a conjugate fraction was also noted. Unmetabolized fluphenazine was selectively extracted into n-heptane. The metabolites were separated by solvent extraction into toluene. Conjugates were hydrolysed back to fluphenazine, fluphenazne sulphoxide and 7-hydroxyfluphenazine. Fluphenazine and fluphenazine conjugates were also measured in the urine of patients receiving long term non-radioactive fluphenazine decanoate therapy. The urinary excretion rate of the conjugate fraction was systematically related to the plasma concentration, regardless of urine flow rate or pH, providing a convenient method for the assessment of fluphenazine kinetics by urinary excretion studies not involving administration of labelled drug.
16001212	Urinary methoxyacetic acid as an indicator of occupational exposure to ethylene glycol dimethyl ether. To investigate whether methoxyacetic acid (MAA) is the metabolite of ethylene glycol dimethyl ether (EGdiME) in humans and whether its metabolite in urine can be used as a biomarker for exposure to EGdiME. Workers occupationally exposed to EGdiME, as well as nonexposed controls, were studied. Urine samples were collected from 20 control subjects and, on Friday postshift, from 14 workers. The identification and quantification of the metabolite were performed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and GC/FID, respectively. Air samples were collected on activated charcoal tubes by area sampling with battery-operated pumps. The glycol ether was analyzed by GC/FID. GC/MS clearly showed the metabolite of EGdiME to be MAA. Urinary MAA levels in the control subjects (background levels) were 0.0-0.3 mg/g crea. The levels of urinary MAA in the solvent-exposed workers were significantly (P<0.0001) higher than those in the control subjects. In the eight workers exposed to an average of 0.3 ppm of EGdiME and the six workers exposed to an average of 2.9 ppm, the mean urinary MAA level was 1.08 (range 0.6-1.5) mg/g crea and 9.33 (range 5.7-18.1) mg/g crea, respectively. These results can be explained by differences in the exposure intensity. Our results suggest that MAA is the metabolite of EGdiME, and that MAA in urine may be used for biological monitoring of EGdiME exposures.
21641977	Development and application of a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for triadimefon and its metabolite triadimenol in rats and humans. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed for the conazole fungicide triadimefon and its primary metabolite, triadimenol. Rat tissue:blood partition coefficients and metabolic constants were measured in vitro for both compounds. Pharmacokinetic data for parent and metabolite were collected from several tissues after intravenous administration of triadimefon to male Sprague-Dawley rats. The model adequately simulated peak blood and tissue concentrations but predicted more rapid clearance of both triadimefon and triadimenol from blood and tissues. Reverse metabolism of triadimenol to triadimefon in the liver was explored as a possible explanation of this slow clearance, with significant improvement in model prediction. The amended model was extrapolated to humans using in vitro metabolic constants measured in human hepatic microsomes. Human equivalent doses (HEDs) were calculated for a rat no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) dose of 3.4mg/kg/day using area under the concentration curve (AUC) in brain and blood for triadimefon and triadimenol as dosimetrics. All dosimetric-based HEDs were 25-30 fold above the human oral reference dose of 0.03mg triadimefon/kg/day, but did not account for intra-human variability or pharmacodynamic differences. Ultimately, derivations of this model will be able to better predict the exposure profile of these and other conazole fungicides in humans.
12569439	Determination of Tripamide in human urine by high-performance liquid chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Tripamide is a drug widely used in clinical practice for the treatment of hypertension and edema. This work evaluated a screening method for Tripamide and its urinary metabolites in human urine, using high-performance liquid chromatography diode-array detection (HPLC/DAD). Identification of these metabolites was investigated by high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS/MS) after dosing with 15 mg Tripamide. Acid hydrolysis showed that Tripamide is conjugated in the body. Two suspected metabolites were detected by HPLC/DAD. HPLC/ESI-MS/MS analysis suggested that these metabolites were probably hydroxylated together with loss of the -NH(2) group and dehydrogenation. These results will be useful in confirmation methods for Tripamide in doping control.
12419014	Metabolism of zaleplon by human liver: evidence for involvement of aldehyde oxidase. 1. The metabolism of Zaleplon (CL-284,846; ZAL) has been studied in precision-cut human liver slices and liver cytosol preparations. 2. Human liver slices metabolized ZAL to a number of products including 5-oxo-ZAL (M2), N-desethyl-5-oxo-ZAL (M1) and N-desethyl-ZAL (DZAL), the latter metabolite being known to be formed by CYP3A forms. 3. Human liver cytosol preparations catalysed the metabolism of ZAL to M2. Kinetic analysis of three cytosol preparations revealed mean (+/- SEM) K(m) and V(max) of 93 +/- 18 mm and 317 +/- 241 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively. 4. Using 16 individual human liver cytosol preparations a 33-fold variability in the metabolism of 80 micro M ZAL to M2 was observed. Correlations were observed between M2 formation and the metabolism of the aldehyde oxidase substrates phenanthridine (r(2) = 0.774) and phthalazine (r(2) = 0.460). 5. The metabolism of 80 micro M ZAL to M2 in liver cytosol preparations was markedly inhibited by the aldehyde oxidase inhibitors chlorpromazine, promethazine, hydralazine and menadione. Additional kinetic analysis suggested that chlorpromazine and promethazine were non-competitive inhibitors of M2 formation with K(i) of 2.3 and 1.9 micro M, respectively. ZAL metabolism to M2 was also inhibited by cimetidine. 6. Incubations conducted with human liver cytosol and H(2)(18)O demonstrated that the oxygen atom incorporated into ZAL and DZAL to form M2 and M1, respectively, was derived from water and not from molecular oxygen. 7. In summary, by correlation analysis, chemical inhibition and H(2)(18)O incorporation studies, ZAL metabolism to M2 in human liver appears to be catalysed by aldehyde oxidase. With human liver slices, ZAL was metabolized to products dependent on both aldehyde oxidase and CYP3A forms.
16953321	Human urine certified reference material CZ 6010: creatinine and toluene metabolites (hippuric acid and o-cresol) and a benzene metabolite (phenol). A reference material for the biological monitoring of occupational exposure to toluene, benzene and phenol was prepared. O-cresol and hippuric acid (metabolites of toluene) are used for the biological monitoring of occupational exposure to toluene. Phenol, a metabolite of benzene, is used for the biological monitoring of exposure to benzene, but phenol can of course also be used as an indicator of exposure to phenol as well. The reference material (RM) used for the determination of these metabolites was prepared by freeze-drying pooled urine samples obtained from healthy persons occupationally exposed to toluene and those taking part in an inhalation experiment. Tests for homogeneity and stability were performed by determining urine concentrations of o-cresol, hippuric acid, creatinine and phenol. To investigate the stability of the RM, the urinary concentrations of o-cresol and phenol were monitored for eighteen months using GC and HPLC, while those of hippuric acid and creatinine were followed for five and six years, respectively, using HPLC. Analysis of variance showed that the concentrations did not change. The certified concentration values (and their uncertainties) of the substances in this reference material (phenol concentration c=6.46+/-0.58 mg l(-1); o-cresol concentration c=1.17+/-0.15 mg l(-1); hippuric acid concentration c=1328+/-30 mg l(-1); creatinine concentration c=0.82+/-0.10 g l(-1)) were evaluated via the interactive statistical programme IPECA.
17523057	Metabolism and excretion of CP-122,721, a non-peptide antagonist of the neurokinin NK1 receptor, in dogs: identification of the novel cleaved product 5-trifluoromethoxy salicylic acid in plasma. The metabolism and excretion of a potent and selective substance P receptor antagonist, CP-122,721, have been studied in beagle dogs following oral administration of a single 5 mg kg(-1) dose of [(14)C]CP-122,721. Total recovery of the administered dose was on average 89% for male dogs and 95% for female dogs. Approximately 94% of the radioactivity recovered in urine and feces was excreted in the first 72 h. Male bile duct-cannulated dogs excreted a mean of approximately 56% of the dose in bile, approximately 11% in feces, and approximately 25% in urine. The sum of radioactivity in bile and urine indicates >80% of the [(14)C]CP-122,721-derived radioactivity was absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract. CP-122,721 was extensively metabolized in dogs, and only a small amount of parent CP-122,721 was excreted as unchanged drug. There were no significant gender-related quantitative/qualitative differences in the excretion of metabolites in urine or feces. The major metabolic pathways of CP-122,721 were O-demethylation, aromatic hydroxylation, and indirect glucuronidation. The minor metabolic pathways included: Aliphatic oxidation at the piperidine moiety, O-dealkylation of the trifluoromethoxy group, and N-dealkylation with subsequent sulfation and/or oxidative deamination. In addition, the novel cleaved product 5-trifluoromethoxy salicylic acid (TFMSA) was identified in plasma. These results suggest that dog is the most relevant animal species in which the metabolism of CP-122,721 can be studied for extrapolating the results to humans.
18588316	Identification and in vitro cytotoxicity of ochratoxin A degradation products formed during coffee roasting. The mycotoxin ochratoxin A is degraded by up to 90% during coffee roasting. In order to investigate this degradation, model heating experiments with ochratoxin A were carried out, and the reaction products were analyzed by HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS/MS. Two ochratoxin A degradation products were identified, and their structure and absolute configuration were determined. As degradation reactions, the isomerization to 14-(R)-ochratoxin A and the decarboxylation to 14-decarboxy-ochratoxin A were identified. Subsequently, an analytical method for the determination of these compounds in roasted coffee was developed. Quantification was carried out by HPLC-MS/MS and the use of stable isotope dilution analysis. By using this method for the analysis of 15 coffee samples from the German market, it could be shown that, during coffee roasting, the ochratoxin A diastereomer 14-(R)-ochratoxin A was formed in amounts of up to 25.6% relative to ochratoxin A. The decarboxylation product was formed only in traces. For toxicity evaluations, first preliminary cell culture assays were performed with the two new substances. Both degradation products exhibited higher IC50 values and caused apoptotic effects with higher concentrations than ochratoxin A in cultured human kidney epithelial cells. Thus, these cell culture data suggest that the degradation products are less cytotoxic than ochratoxin A.
17446266	In vitro metabolic characterization, phenotyping, and kinetic studies of 9cUAB30, a retinoid X receptor-specific retinoid. The present study was conducted to compare the in vitro phase I and phase II metabolic profiles of (2E,4E,6Z,8E)-8-(3',4'-dihydro-1'(2'H)-naphthalen-1'-ylidene)-3,7-dimethyl-2,4,6-octatrienoic acid (9cUAB30) in human, rat, and dog microsomes and to characterize and identify the associated metabolic kinetics and specific isozymes from human liver microsomes (HLM) responsible for metabolism, respectively. Data from these experiments revealed that nine (M1-M9) phase I metabolites along with a single glucuronide conjugate were observed across the species investigated. With the exception of glucuronidation, no evidence of metabolism was detected for phase II enzymes (data not shown). Significant differences between species with regard to metabolic profile, stability, and gender were noted. For the eight phase I metabolites detected in HLM, the specific isozymes responsible for the biotransformations were CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, with minor contributions from CYP1A2 and CYP2B6. For the glucuronide conjugate, UGT1A9 was the major catalyzing enzyme, with a minor contribution from UGT1A3. Kinetic analysis of eight of the detected metabolites indicated that four seemed to follow classical hyperbolic kinetics, whereas the remaining four showed evidence of either autoactivation or substrate inhibition.
12888209	Simultaneous determination of JTT-501 and its main metabolite in human plasma by liquid chromatography-ionspray mass spectrometry. An LC-MS-MS analytical method was developed for the determination of a new antidiabetic agent, JTT-501 and its main metabolite (JTP-20604) in human plasma. The compounds were isolated from plasma by protein precipitation before analysis by HPLC with atmospheric pressure positive ionisation MS-MS detection. An isotopically labelled analog of JTT-501 was used as the internal standard. Linearity was demonstrated over the calibration range of about 5-10000 ng/ml for both compounds. The assay was validated with respect to accuracy, precision and analyte stability. This method was used for the determination of plasma concentrations for the two compounds in a clinical tolerability study. A cross-validation exercise between two different mass spectrometers, used for the determination of clinical samples, is also reported.
23954659	Reliable quantitation of β-hydroxyethoxyacetic acid in human urine by an isotope-dilution GC-MS procedure. An analytical method for the determination of β-hydroxyethoxyacetic acid (HEAA), the main urinary metabolite of 1,4-dioxane was developed and validated. The presented method involves liquid-liquid extraction of HEAA from the urine samples, followed by silylation and subsequent analytical separation and detection using GC-MS. The method is characterized by its simple and fast sample preparation in combination with a robust chromatography. The use of isotope dilution analysis enables an efficient compensation of matrix related effects and analyte losses due to sample workup. The excellent reliability and reproducibility of the method is demonstrated by the good accuracy and precision data. Within-day precision and day-to-day precision ranged from 0.6 to 1.2% and 1.5 to 2.6%, respectively. The mean relative recovery of the method was found to be 98-101%. The LOD and LOQ of HEAA were determined to be 0.2mg/L and 0.6mg/L, respectively. In summary, the presented analytical method is well suited to be used for routine biomonitoring of occupational exposure to 1,4-dioxane.
18411402	Bioactivation of flutamide metabolites by human liver microsomes. Flutamide, a widely used nonsteroidal antiandrogen drug for the treatment of prostate cancer, has been associated with rare incidences of hepatotoxicity in patients. It is believed that bioactivation of flutamide and subsequent covalent binding to cellular proteins is responsible for its toxicity. A novel N-S glutathione adduct has been identified in a previous bioactivation study of flutamide (Kang et al., 2007). Due to the extensive first pass metabolism, flutamide metabolites such as 2-hydroxyflutamide and 4-nitro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenylamine (Flu-1) have achieved plasma concentrations higher than the parent in prostate cancer patients. In vitro studies in human liver microsomes were conducted to probe the cytochrome P450 (P450)-mediated bioactivation of flutamide metabolites and identify the possible reactive species using reduced glutathione (GSH) as a trapping agent. Several GSH adducts (G1, Flu-1-G1, Flu-1-G2, Flu-6-Gs) derived from the metabolites of flutamide were identified and characterized. A comprehensive bioactivation mechanism was proposed to account for the formation of the observed GSH adducts. Of interest were the formation of a reactive intermediate by the desaturation of the isopropyl group of M5 and the unusual bioactivation of Flu-1. Studies using recombinant P450s suggested that the major P450 isozymes involved in the bioactivation of flutamide and its metabolites were CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2C19. These findings suggested that, in addition to the direct bioactivation of flutamide, the metabolites of flutamide could also be bioactivated and contribute to flutamide-induced hepatotoxicity.
20053818	Disposition of [1'-(14)C]stavudine after oral administration to humans. The disposition of stavudine, a potent and orally active nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, was investigated in six healthy human subjects. Before dosing humans with [1'-(14)C]stavudine, a tissue distribution study was performed in Long-Evans rats. Results from this study showed no accumulation of radioactivity in any of the tissues studied, indicating that the position of the (14)C-label on the molecule was appropriate for the human study. After a single 80-mg (100 microCi) oral dose of [1'-(14)C]stavudine, approximately 95% of the radioactive dose was excreted in urine with an elimination half-life of 2.35 h. Fecal excretion was limited, accounting for only 3% of the dose. Unchanged stavudine was the major drug-related component in plasma (61% of area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero extrapolated to infinite time of the total plasma radioactivity) and urine (67% of dose). The remaining radioactivity was associated with minor metabolites, including mono- and bis-oxidized stavudine, glucuronide conjugates of stavudine and its oxidized metabolite, and an N-acetylcysteine (NAC) conjugate of the ribose (M4) after glycosidic cleavage. Formation of metabolite M4 was shown in human liver microsomes incubated with 2',3'-didehydrodideoxyribose, the sugar base of stavudine, in the presence of NAC. In addition, after similar microsomal incubations fortified with GSH, two GSH conjugates, 3'-GS-deoxyribose and 1'-keto-2',3'-dideoxy-3'-GS-ribose, were observed. This suggests that 2',3'-didehydrodideoxyribose underwent cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation leading to an epoxide intermediate, 2',3'-ribose epoxide, followed by GSH addition. In conclusion, absorption and elimination of stavudine were rapid and complete after oral dosing, with urinary excretion of unchanged drug as the predominant route of elimination in humans.
23361230	2-methiopropamine, a thiophene analogue of methamphetamine: studies on its metabolism and detectability in the rat and human using GC-MS and LC-(HR)-MS techniques. 2-Methiopropamine [1-(thiophen-2-yl)-2-methylaminopropane, 2-MPA], a thiophene analogue of methamphetamine, is available from online vendors selling "research chemicals." The first samples were seized by the German police in 2011. As it is a recreational stimulant, its inclusion in routine drug screening protocols should be required. The aims of this study were to identify the phase I and II metabolites of 2-MPA in rat and human urine and to identify the human cytochrome-P450 (CYP) isoenzymes involved in its phase I metabolism. In addition, the detectability of 2-MPA in urine samples using the authors' well-established gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-linear ion trap-mass spectrometry (LC-MS(n)) screening protocols was also evaluated. The metabolites were isolated from rat and human urine samples by solid-phase extraction without or following enzymatic cleavage of conjugates. The phase I metabolites, following acetylation, were separated and identified by GC-MS and/or liquid chromatography-high-resolution linear ion trap mass spectrometry (LC-HR-MS(n)) and the phase II metabolites by LC-HR-MS(n). The following major metabolic pathways were proposed: N-demethylation, hydroxylation at the side chain and at the thiophene ring, and combination of these transformations followed by glucuronidation and/or sulfation. CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 were identified as the major phase I metabolizing enzymes. They were also involved in the N-demethylation of the analogue methamphetamine and CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 in its ring hydroxylation. Following the administration of a typical user's dose, 2-MPA and its metabolites were identified in rat urine using the authors' GC-MS and the LC-MS(n) screening approaches. Ingestion of 2-MPA could also be detected by both protocols in an authentic human urine sample.
15386482	Interactions of tamoxifen, N-desmethyltamoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen with P-glycoprotein and CYP3A. The effects of tamoxifen, N-desmethyltamoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen on transport attributable to P-glycoprotein were studied using Caco-2 cell monolayers in a transwell system, with rhodamine-123 as an index substrate for inhibition studies. The three compounds did not demonstrate differential flux between basal-apical and apical-basal directions in Caco-2 monolayers. The mean IC50 values for inhibition of rhodamine-123 transport were: 29 microM for tamoxifen; 26 microM for N-desmethyltamoxifen; and 7.4 microM for 4-hydroxytamoxifen. The three compounds were also evaluated as potential inhibitors of human CYP3A based on an in vitro model using triazolam hydroxylation by human liver microsomes as an index reaction. Mean (+/-SE) IC50 values versus formation of alpha-hydroxy-triazolam and 4-hydroxy-triazolam in human liver microsomes were, respectively: 23.5 (+/-3.9) and 18.4 (+/-5.3) microM for tamoxifen; 10.2 (+/-1.7) and 9.2 (+/-1.5) microM for N-desmethyltamoxifen; and 2.6 (+/-0.5) and 2.7 (+/-0.3) microM for 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Thus, tamoxifen, N-desmethyltamoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen, do not appear to be substrates for transport by P-glycoprotein. However, tamoxifen has the potential to inhibit transport mediated by P-glycoprotein as well as CYP3A-mediated metabolism. Inhibitory effects of the principal metabolites, N-desmethyltamoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen, may exceed those of the parent drug. Tamoxifen, and possibly its metabolites, may have the potential to cause drug interactions by inhibiting both drug transport and metabolism. This possibility requires further evaluation in clinical studies.
22359337	New cathinone-derived designer drugs 3-bromomethcathinone and 3-fluoromethcathinone: studies on their metabolism in rat urine and human liver microsomes using GC-MS and LC-high-resolution MS and their detectability in urine. 3-Bromomethcathinone (3-BMC) and 3-Fluoromethcathinone (3-FMC) are two new designer drugs, which were seized in Israel during 2009 and had also appeared on the illicit drug market in Germany. These two compounds were sold via the Internet as so-called "bath salts" or "plant feeders." The aim of the present study was to identify for the first time the 3-BMC and 3-FMC Phase I and II metabolites in rat urine and human liver microsomes using GC-MS and LC-high-resolution MS (HR-MS) and to test for their detectability by established urine screening approaches using GC-MS or LC-MS. Furthermore, the human cytochrome-P450 (CYP) isoenzymes responsible for the main metabolic steps were studied to highlight possible risks of consumption due to drug-drug interaction or genetic variations. For the first aim, rat urine samples were extracted after and without enzymatic cleavage of conjugates. The metabolites were separated and identified by GC-MS and by LC-HR-MS. The main metabolic steps were N-demethylation, reduction of the keto group to the corresponding alcohol, hydroxylation of the aromatic system and combinations of these steps. The elemental composition of the metabolites identified by GC-MS could be confirmed by LC-HR-MS. Furthermore, corresponding Phase II metabolites were identified using the LC-HR-MS approach. For both compounds, detection in rat urine was possible within the authors' systematic toxicological analysis using both GC-MS and LC-MS(n) after a suspected recreational users dose. Following CYP enzyme kinetic studies, CYP2B6 was the most relevant enzyme for both the N-demethylation of 3-BMC and 3-FMC after in vitro-in vivo extrapolation.
14643514	Toxicological detection of the new designer drug 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)piperazine and its metabolites in urine and differentiation from an intake of structurally related medicaments using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Studies are described on the toxicological analysis of the piperazine-derived designer drug 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)piperazine (MeOPP) in rat urine using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The authors' systematic toxicological analysis (STA) procedure using full-scan GC-MS after acid hydrolysis, liquid-liquid extraction and microwave-assisted acetylation allowed the detection of MeOPP and its metabolites 1-(4-hydroxy phenyl)piperazine and 4-hydroxyaniline in rat urine after administration of a single dose corresponding to doses commonly taken by drug users. Therefore, this procedure should also be suitable for detection of a MeOPP intake in human urine. However, the metabolites of MeOPP are not unique and can be produced from other drugs. Therefore, differentiation of use of this designer drug from use of the medicaments dropropizine, oxypertine or others, which are metabolized to the MeOPP isomer 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine, is discussed.
16366672	Metabolism of the olive oil phenols hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, and hydroxytyrosyl acetate by human hepatoma HepG2 cells. To study the potential hepatic metabolism of olive oil phenols, human hepatoma HepG2 cells were incubated for 2 and 18 h with hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, and hydroxytyrosyl acetate, three phenolic constituents of olive oil. After incubation, culture media and cell lysates were hydrolyzed with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase and analyzed by LC-MS. In vitro methylation, glucuronidation, and sulfation of pure phenols were also performed. Methylated and glucuronidated forms of hydroxytyrosol were detected at 18 h of incubation, together with methylglucuronidated metabolites. Hydroxytyrosyl acetate was largely converted into free hydroxytyrosol and subsequently metabolized, yet small amounts of glucuronidated hydroxytyrosyl acetate were detected. Tyrosol was poorly metabolized, with <10% of the phenol glucuronidated after 18 h. Minor amounts of free or conjugated phenols were detected in cell lysates. No sulfated metabolites were found. In conclusion, olive oil phenols can be metabolized by the liver as suggested by the results obtained using HepG2 cells as a hepatic model system.
18694910	Metabolism and disposition of fluticasone furoate, an enhanced-affinity glucocorticoid, in humans. The purpose of this study was to investigate the metabolism and disposition of fluticasone furoate, an enhanced-affinity glucocorticoid receptor agonist, in humans. In a two-part, open-label design study, five healthy male subjects received a p.o. dose of 2 mg of [(14)C]fluticasone furoate, followed 4 weeks later by an i.v. dose of 0.25 mg of [(14)C]fluticasone furoate (as a 30-min infusion). Oral absorption was rapid and estimated at approximately 30%, although the oral bioavailability was markedly lower at 1.6%, limited by extensive first-pass metabolism. Plasma clearance was 58.3 l/h, with a volume of distribution of 642 liters and a terminal elimination half-life of 15.3 h. The major circulating component identified in plasma extracts after i.v. and p.o. dosing was unchanged parent compound, with 17beta-carboxylic acid (GW694301X; M10) also being notable after p.o. administration. Mean recovery of radioactivity was approximately 92 and 102% at 216 and 168 h after i.v. and p.o. administration, respectively, with most (at least 90%) recovered in the feces. Fluticasone furoate was extensively metabolized, with only trace amounts of unchanged parent compound observed in feces following either route of administration. The predominant pathway was removal of the S-fluoromethyl carbothioate group to yield GW694301X (M10). Other pathways included oxidative defluorination to yield a hydroxyl at the C6 position. There was no evidence for metabolic loss of the furoate group from fluticasone furoate or any of its metabolites. Evidence presented suggests that enterocytes have a role in the metabolism of unabsorbed fluticasone furoate.
11823757	Effect of modafinil on the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and triazolam in healthy volunteers. Modafinil has been reported to produce a concentration-related induction of CYP3A4/5 activity in vitro in primary cultures of human hepatocytes. Our objective was to determine whether the pharmacokinetics of steady-state ethinyl estradiol (INN, ethinylestradiol) and single-dose triazolam were altered after 4 weeks of modafinil treatment in volunteers. This was a placebo-controlled, single-blind, single-period study in 41 female subjects who were receiving long-term treatment with an oral contraceptive that contained ethinyl estradiol (0.035 mg) and norgestimate (0.180-0.250 mg). Pharmacokinetic profiles for ethinyl estradiol and for a single oral dose of triazolam (0.125 mg) were obtained the day before initiation of treatment with modafinil (200 mg for 7 days, followed by 400 mg for 21 days) or placebo (28 days). A second dose of triazolam was administered with the final dose of modafinil, and pharmacokinetic profiling was repeated. The modafinil treatment group had a marked decrease in maximum observed plasma concentrations and areas under the plasma concentration-time curve for triazolam relative to placebo, with a much smaller decrease in these parameters for ethinyl estradiol. The half-life of triazolam was also decreased, but the half-life of ethinyl estradiol did not appear to be affected by treatment with modafinil. Modafinil induced CYP3A4/5 activity in humans in vivo, suggesting that there is potential for metabolic drug-drug interactions between modafinil and substrates of CYP3A4/5. However, the induction appeared to be more gastrointestinal than hepatic in nature. Therefore significant metabolic drug-drug interactions are most likely to occur with compounds (such as triazolam) that undergo significant gastrointestinal CYP3A4/5-mediated first-pass metabolism.
16522362	Simultaneous analysis of thiamphenicol and its prodrug thiamphenicol glycinate in human plasma and urine by high performance liquid chromatography: application to pharmacokinetic study. A simple and sensitive method for simultaneous determination of the active compound, thiamphenicol (TAP) and its prodrug, thiamphenicol glycinate (TG) in human plasma and urine is described. The procedure involved extraction of TG and TAP with ethyl acetate (plasma) or 100-fold dilution with the mobile phase (urine) followed by determination by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection at 224 nm. Separation of the compounds was achieved on a column packed with Hypersil ODS2. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile-water containing 0.003 M tetrabutyl ammonium bromide and 0.056 M ammonium acetate (87:13, v/v) with a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The chromatograms did not contain interfering peaks due to the suitable extraction procedure and chromatographic conditions. The calibration curves of TG and TAP were linear ranging from 0.78 to 100 microg/ml in plasma and in urine. The intra-day and inter-day relative standard deviations (S.D.) were less than 10%. The recoveries of TG and TAP in plasma and urine were above 80%. TG was not stable in plasma samples and after extraction at ambient temperature or in freeze-thaw cycles, and hence the samples for injection on HPLC column should be stored in refrigerator or under ice cooling prior to analysis, and the plasma samples should not experience the freeze-thaw cycle more than one time. Unlike TAP, TG could not be detected in most urine samples. Application of this method demonstrated that it was feasible for the clinical pharmacokinetic study.
20219851	In vitro characterization of sarizotan metabolism: hepatic clearance, identification and characterization of metabolites, drug-metabolizing enzyme identification, and evaluation of cytochrome p450 inhibition. In vitro biotransformation studies of sarizotan using human liver microsomes (HLM) showed aromatic and aliphatic monohydroxylation and dealkylation. Recombinant cytochromes P450 (P450) together with P450-selective inhibitors in HLM/hepatocyte cultures were used to evaluate the relative contribution of different P450s and revealed major involvement of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C8, and CYP1A2 in sarizotan metabolism. The apparent K(m, u) and V(max) of sarizotan clearance, as investigated in HLM, were 9 microM and 3280 pmol/mg/min, predicting in vivo hepatic clearance of 0.94 l/h, which indicates that sarizotan is a low-clearance compound in humans and suggests nonsaturable metabolism at the targeted plasma concentration (< or =1 microM). This finding is confirmed by the reported human clearance (CL/F of 3.6-4.4 l/h) and by the dose-linear area under the curve increase observed with doses up to 25 mg. The inhibitory effect of sarizotan toward six major P450s was evaluated using P450-specific marker reactions in pooled HLM. K(i, u) values of sarizotan against CYP2C8, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 were >10 microM, whereas those against CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 were 0.43 and 8.7 microM, respectively. Based on the estimates of sarizotan concentrations at the enzyme active sites, no clinically significant drug-drug interactions (DDIs) due to P450 inhibition are expected. This result has been confirmed in human DDI studies in which no inhibition of five major P450s was observed in terms of marker metabolite formation.
18854379	Prediction of the effect of erythromycin, diltiazem, and their metabolites, alone and in combination, on CYP3A4 inhibition. Predictive models of complex drug-drug interactions between multiple inhibitors and their metabolites have not been evaluated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate an interaction model for cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) that incorporated the simultaneous reversible and irreversible inhibition by multiple inhibitors. Erythromycin (ERY) and diltiazem (DTZ), and their major metabolites, N-desmethylerythromycin (nd-ERY) and N-desmethyldiltiazem (nd-DTZ), were chosen to evaluate the model. k(inact) (rate constant for maximal inactivation), K(I) (inhibitor concentration at 50% maximal inactivation), and K(i) (reversible inhibition constant) were estimated for ERY, DTZ, nd-ERY, and nd-DTZ, respectively, using cDNA-expressed CYP3A4 and human liver microsomes under optimal experimental conditions. To evaluate the interaction model, combinations of inhibitors and metabolites were incubated at concentrations equal to K(I), (1/2)K(I), and 2K(I) of each inhibitor for specified durations in both enzyme systems. The models were further evaluated by the incubation of combinations of inhibitors with the substrate testosterone for 10 min. CYP3A4 inhibition in the presence of drug mixtures was predicted from the inhibition parameters determined for each drug or metabolite alone. The CYP3A4 activity in the presence of multiple inhibitors was well predicted by the model incorporating additive irreversible inhibition as modified by mutual competitive inhibition (percent mean error and percent mean absolute error ranged from -0.06 to 0.04 and from 0.03 to 0.09, respectively). In conclusion, the additive model predicted the combined effect of multiple inhibitors on CYP3A inhibition in vitro. However, simultaneous reversible and irreversible inhibition effects should be taken into account in a reaction mixture of substrate and multiple inhibitors of CYP3A4.
15242824	Methadone metabolism by human placenta. Methadone pharmacotherapy is considered the standard for treatment of the pregnant heroin/opioid addict. One of the factors affecting the transfer kinetics of opioids across human placenta and their levels in the fetal circulation is their metabolism by the tissue. The aim of this investigation is to identify the enzyme(s) responsible for the metabolism of methadone, determine the kinetics of the reaction and the metabolites formed utilizing placental tissue obtained from term healthy pregnancies. Microsomal fractions of trophoblast tissue homogenates had the highest activity in catalyzing the metabolism of methadone. The product formed was identified by HPLC-UV as 2-ethylidine-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP). Inhibitors selective for cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes were used to identify the enzyme catalyzing the biotransformation of methadone. Aminoglutethimide and 4-hydroxyandrostenedione inhibited EDDP formation by 88 and 70%, respectively, suggesting that CYP19/aromatase is the enzyme catalyzing the reaction. This was confirmed by the effect of monoclonal antibodies raised against CYP19 that caused an 80% inhibition of the reaction. The apparent K(m) and V(max) values for the CYP19 catalyzed metabolism of methadone to EDDP were 424 +/- 92 microM and 420 +/- 89 pmol(mgprotein)(-1)min(-1), respectively. Kinetic analysis of a cDNA-expressed CYP19 for the metabolism of methadone to EDDP was identical to that by placental microsomes. Taken together, these data indicate that CYP19/aromatase is the major enzyme responsible for the metabolism of methadone to EDDP in term human placentas obtained from healthy pregnancies.
23973791	Development and validation of a sensitive LC-MS/MS assay for the simultaneous quantification of allitinib and its two metabolites in human plasma. Allitinib, also known as AST1306, is a novel irreversible inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptors 1 and 2. Allitinib is currently used in clinical trial to treat solid tumors. A previous study showed that allitinib is extensively metabolized in humans. Amide hydrolysis metabolite (M6) and 29,30-dihydrodiol allitinib (M10) are the major metabolites in circulation. To study the pharmacokinetics of allitinib and its two major metabolites in cancer patients, a rapid, sensitive and reliable LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of allitinib, M6 and M10 in human plasma. After simple protein precipitation, the analytes and the combined internal standards (lapatinib and NB-2, an analog of allitinib) were separated on a Zorbax Eclipase XDB C18 column (50 mm × 4.6 mm, 1.8 μm, Agilent) using a mobile phase of 5 mM ammonium acetate with 0.1% formic acid (phase A) and 50% (v/v) methanol in acetonitrile (phase B) with gradient elution. Mass spectrometric detection was conducted by atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization in positive ion multiple reaction monitoring modes using AB Sciex Triple Quad 6500 system. Linear calibration curves were obtained for the following concentration range: 0.300-200 ng/ml for allitinib; 0.030-20.0 ng/ml for M6; and 0.075-50.0 ng/ml for M10. Intra-day and inter-day accuracy and precision were within the acceptable limits of ±15% at all of the concentrations. The method was successfully applied to a preliminary clinical pharmacokinetic study following oral administration of allitinib tosylate tablets in cancer patients.
19415181	Phase I, pharmacokinetic study of temsirolimus administered orally to patients with advanced cancer. An oral formulation of temsirolimus (Torisel), an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin, was evaluated on an intermittent schedule (once daily for 5 days every 2 weeks) in patients with advanced cancer. The maximum tolerated dose was determined to be 75 mg after dose-limiting toxicities of grade 3 elevated aminotransferases (1 patient) and grade 3 rash (1 patient) occurred with a 100-mg dose. The most common temsirolimus-related adverse events were mucositis, rash/maculopapular rash, and asthenia. Six of 12 patients who received the 75-mg dose required dose reductions due to temsirolimus-related adverse events. Two patients who received 75-mg temsirolimus and did not have dose reductions had minor tumor responses. Relative exposure from contributions of both temsirolimus and sirolimus, the principal metabolite, was 17.9% of the 75-mg dose. Thus, oral temsirolimus, 75 mg administered once daily for 5 days every 2 weeks, was further evaluated in patients with metastatic breast cancer.
19032724	Population pharmacokinetic modelling of aripiprazole and its active metabolite, dehydroaripiprazole, in psychiatric patients. The aims of this study were to develop a combined population pharmacokinetic model for both aripiprazole and its active metabolite, dehydroaripiprazole, in psychiatric patients and to identify to what extent the genetic polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes contribute to the variability in pharmacokinetics (PK). A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using NONMEM software based on 141 plasma concentrations at steady state from 80 patients receiving multiple oral doses of aripiprazole (10-30 mg day(-1)). A one-compartment model with first-order kinetics for aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole each was developed to describe simultaneously the concentration data. The absorption rate constant was fixed to 1.06 h(-1). The typical value of apparent distribution volume of aripiprazole was estimated to be 192 l. Covariate analysis showed that CYP2D6 genetic polymorphisms significantly influenced the apparent clearance of aripiprazole (CL/F), reducing the interindividual variability on CL/F from 37.8% CV (coefficient of variation) to 30.5%. The CL/F in the CYP2D6 IMs was approximately 60% of that in CYP2D6 EMs having two functional alleles. Based on the CYP2D6 genotype, the metabolic ratios were calculated at 0.20-0.34. However, the plasma concentration : dose ratios of dehydroaripiprazole were not different across the CYP2D6 genotype. This population pharmacokinetic model provided an adequate fit to the data for both aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole in psychiatric patients. The usefulness of CYP genotyping as an aid to select the starting dose should be further investigated.
18838508	Transepithelial transport of the group II metabotropic glutamate 2/3 receptor agonist (1S,2S,5R,6S)-2-aminobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,6-dicarboxylate (LY354740) and its prodrug (1S,2S,5R,6S)-2-[(2'S)-(2'-amino)propionyl]aminobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,6-dicarboxylate (LY544344). The limited oral bioavailability of the potent and selective group II metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) 2/3 receptor agonist, (1S,2S,5R,6S)-2-aminobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,6-dicarboxylate (LY354740), was shown to be improved by its peptidyl prodrug, (1S,2S,5R,6S)-2-[(2'S)-(2'-amino)propionyl]aminobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,6-dicarboxylate (LY544344). The purpose of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms of intestinal absorption of LY354740 and its prodrug LY544344. Transepithelial transport and accumulation studies were performed in Caco-2 cell monolayers; the involvement of the peptide transporter 1 (PEPT1) transporter was also examined. In absorptive transport studies, the peptidyl prodrug LY544344 partially hydrolyzed to release LY354740 intracellularly, and both compounds appeared in the basolateral compartment. The absorptive transport rate of LY544344, basolateral appearance rate of LY354740, and their cellular accumulation after incubation with LY544344 were concentration-dependent. PEPT1 inhibition reduced transepithelial transport and cellular accumulation of LY544344 to 22 and 1.1% of control, respectively. LY354740 showed concentration-independent absorptive transport with negligible cellular accumulation. Efflux and trans-stimulation studies revealed predominantly apical efflux and the existence of specific transporters for LY544344 and intracellularly released LY354740 on the apical and basolateral membranes. LY544344 efflux was also trans-stimulated at the apical side by glycyl-glutamate but not by glycyl-sarcosine. Transport of neither compound was affected by P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux, as shown in transport and uptake inhibition studies in Madin-Darby canine kidney multidrug resistance 1-transfected cell line and inverted membrane vesicles. In conclusion, LY354740 is mainly transported by the paracellular pathway, whereas intestinal absorption of LY544344 is mediated by PEPT1. However, the absorptive transport of LY544344 seems to be modulated by an apical efflux transporter and a rate-limiting transport step across the basolateral membrane.
21457144	In vitro and in vivo biodistribution of ZRS1, a stabilized type I N-acetoxymethyl carbamate-containing combi-molecule. Combi-molecules are agents designed to block receptors on their own and to further degrade to bioactive agents. Here we studied the fate of a novel combi-molecule of triazene class termed "ZRS1" in biological medium using multilayer aggregates and mouse tumour models. ZRS1 is a second generation derivative of RB107, a prodrug designed to release an EGFR inhibitor FD105 plus a methyl diazonium species. RB107 contains an acetoxymethyl function that is hydrolyzed too rapidly to generate BJ2000, a monoalkyltriazene that further degrades to FD105 and DNA alkylating methyldiazonium species. Recently, in order to prevent rapid hydrolysis of the acetoxymethylene function in the absence of cells and to delay the release of BJ2000, we designed ZRS1 that contains a more stable acetoxymethyl carbamate function. The results showed that ZRS1 was more stable than RB107 in cell culture medium supplemented with serum, with a rather long half life (>2 h). However, in an experiment where it was allowed to degrade in multilayer aggregates of ovarian cancer cells OV90, it rapidly released BJ2000 and its corresponding metabolite FD105, both in the medium and the multilayer aggregates. Interestingly, the intact ZRS1 could be detected in the multilayer aggregates with a T(max) around 10 min. Studies in vivo, in human DU145 prostate cancer xenograft model, revealed that ZRS1 blocked tumour growth and released FD105 and its acetylated metabolite FD105Ac, the latter being the major metabolite. Likewise, time course analysis in 4T1 mouse syngeneic breast cancer model showed a rapid release of FD105 and FD105Ac in the plasma and in the tumours. In summary, ZRS1 appeared as a good prodrug of the stable EGFR inhibitory metabolites FD105 and FD105Ac. Its ability to generate high concentrations of FD105Ac, a more potent EGFR inhibitor as is its major metabolite, is significant over previous methylating combi-molecules. Furthermore, this study showed that multilayer OV90 aggregates could be developed as an effective model to predict the stability and degradation of ZRS1 in vivo.
15113612	Comparative bioavailability of rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide from a four drug fixed dose combination with separate formulations at the same dose levels. Fixed dose combination (FDC) formulations became popular in the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) because of the better patient compliance, reduced risk of monotherapy and emergence of drug resistance in contrast to treatment with separate formulations of two to four first-line drugs. However, its successful implementation in national programs is limited by probable bioinequivalency of rifampicin if present in FDC form. In this regard, World Health Organization (WHO) and International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUATLD) recommend FDCs only of proven bioavailability. Hence, bioequivalence study of four drug FDC tablet was conducted using 22 healthy male volunteers according to WHO recommended protocol to determine bioavailability of rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide compared to standard separate combination at the same dose level. The study was designed as two period, two treatment crossover experiment with a washout period of 1 week. Bioequivalence of rifampicin was estimated by plasma and urinary method for both rifampicin and its active metabolite, des-acetyl rifampicin whereas isoniazid and pyrazinamide were estimated from plasma. Mean concentration time profiles and all the pharmacokinetic parameters of rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide from FDC tablet were comparable to individual formulations and passed the bioequivalence test with power of the test above 95%. Further, bioequivalence of both rifampicin and isoniazid shows that in vitro interaction of rifampicin and isoniazid is clinically insignificant. Thus, it was concluded that FDC formulation is bioequivalent for rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide and ensures the successful treatment of TB without compromising therapeutic efficacy of any of these components of anti-TB therapy.
20801890	Mechanism of activation of PSI-7851 and its diastereoisomer PSI-7977. A phosphoramidate prodrug of 2'-deoxy-2'-α-fluoro-β-C-methyluridine-5'-monophosphate, PSI-7851, demonstrates potent anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) activity both in vitro and in vivo. PSI-7851 is a mixture of two diastereoisomers, PSI-7976 and PSI-7977, with PSI-7977 being the more active inhibitor of HCV RNA replication in the HCV replicon assay. To inhibit the HCV NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, PSI-7851 must be metabolized to the active triphosphate form. The first step, hydrolysis of the carboxyl ester by human cathepsin A (CatA) and/or carboxylesterase 1 (CES1), is a stereospecific reaction. Western blot analysis showed that CatA and CES1 are both expressed in primary human hepatocytes. However, expression of CES1 is undetectable in clone A replicon cells. Studies with inhibitors of CatA and/or CES1 indicated that CatA is primarily responsible for hydrolysis of the carboxyl ester in clone A cells, although in primary human hepatocytes, both CatA and CES1 contribute to the hydrolysis. Hydrolysis of the ester is followed by a putative nucleophilic attack on the phosphorus by the carboxyl group resulting in the spontaneous elimination of phenol and the production of an alaninyl phosphate metabolite, PSI-352707, which is common to both isomers. The removal of the amino acid moiety of PSI-352707 is catalyzed by histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (Hint1) to give the 5'-monophosphate form, PSI-7411. siRNA-mediated Hint1 knockdown studies further indicate that Hint1 is, at least in part, responsible for converting PSI-352707 to PSI-7411. PSI-7411 is then consecutively phosphorylated to the diphosphate, PSI-7410, and to the active triphosphate metabolite, PSI-7409, by UMP-CMP kinase and nucleoside diphosphate kinase, respectively.
17433262	Roles of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 in methyl hydroxylated and N-oxidized metabolite formation from voriconazole, a new anti-fungal agent, in human liver microsomes. Involvement of cytochrome P450 (P450 or CYP) 2C19, 2C9, and 3A4 in N-oxidation of voriconazole, a new triazole antifungal agent, has been demonstrated using human liver microsomes. To confirm the precise roles of P450 isoforms in voriconazole clearance in individuals, we investigated the oxidative metabolism of voriconazole catalyzed by recombinant P450s as well as human liver microsomes genotyped for the CYP2C19 gene. Among recombinant P450 isoforms using Escherichia coli expression systems, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 had voriconazole N-oxidation activities, but not CYP2C9. Apparent K(m) and V(max) values of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 for voriconazole N-oxidation were 14+/-6 microM and 0.22+/-0.02 nmol/min/nmol CYP2C19 and 16+/-10 microM and 0.05+/-0.01 nmol/min/nmol CYP3A4, respectively (mean+/-S.E.). CYP3A4 produced a new methyl hydroxylated metabolite from voriconazole, detected by LC/UV and LC/MS/MS and confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR analyses, with K(m) and V(max) values of 11+/-3 microM and 0.10+/-0.01 nmol/min/nmol CYP3A4. The voriconazole 4-hydroxylation to N-oxidation metabolic ratios in liver microsomes from the wild-type CYP2C19*1/*1 individuals (0.07) were lower than those observed in other genotypes (0.20-0.27) at a substrate concentration of 25 microM based on the reported clinical plasma level. These results suggest that the CYP2C19 genotype, but not CYP2C9 genotype, would be evaluated as a key factor in the pharmacokinetics of voriconazole and that 4-hydroxyvoriconazole formation may become an important pathway for voriconazole metabolism in individuals with poor CYP2C19 catalytic function.
23584048	Analytical power of LLE-HPLC-PDA-MS/MS in drug metabolism studies: identification of new nabumetone metabolites. Nabumetone is a non-acidic, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory prodrug. Following oral administration, the prodrug is converted in the liver to 6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid (6-MNA), which was found to be the principal metabolite responsible for the NSAID effect. The pathway of nabumetone transformation to 6-MNA has not been clarified, with no intermediates between nabumetone and 6-MNA having been identified to date. In this study, a new, as yet unreported phase I metabolite was discovered within the evaluation of nabumetone metabolism by human and rat liver microsomal fractions. Extracts from the biomatrices were subjected to chiral LLE-HPLC-PDA and achiral LLE-UHPLC-MS/MS analyses to elucidate the chemical structure of this metabolite. UHPLC-MS/MS experiments detected the presence of a structure corresponding to elemental composition C15H16O3, which was tentatively assigned as a hydroxylated nabumetone. Identical nabumetone and HO-nabumetone UV spectra obtained from the PDA detector ruled out the presence of the hydroxy group in the aromatic moiety of nabumetone. Hence, the most likely structure of the new metabolite was 4-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)-3-hydroxybutan-2-one (3-hydroxy nabumetone). To confirm this structure, the standard of this nabumetone metabolite was synthesized, its spectral (UV, CD, NMR, MS/MS) and retention properties on chiral and achiral chromatographic columns were evaluated and compared with those of the authentic nabumetone metabolite. To elucidate the subsequent biotransformation of 3-hydroxy nabumetone, the compound was used as a substrate in incubation with human and rat liver microsomal fraction. A number of 3-hydroxy nabumetone metabolites (products of conjugation with glucuronic acid, O-desmethylation, carbonyl reduction and their combination) were discovered in the extracts from the incubated microsomes using LLE-HPLC-PDA-MS/MS experiments. On the other hand, when 3-hydroxy nabumetone was incubated with isolated rat hepatocytes, 6-MNA was detected as the principal metabolite of 3-hydroxy nabumetone. Hence, 3-hydroxy nabumetone could be the missing link in nabumetone biotransformation to 6-MNA (i.e. nabumetone→3-hydroxy nabumetone→6-MNA).
22960998	The effect of genetic polymorphisms in UGT2B15 on the pharmacokinetic profile of sipoglitazar, a novel anti-diabetic agent. Sipoglitazar was a novel, azolealkanoic acid derivative that possesses selective activity for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) PPARγ, PPARα, and PPARδ. The compound undergoes phase II biotransformation by conjugation catalyzed by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT). The aim of this analysis was to explore the influence of genetic polymorphism in UGT on the pharmacokinetics of sipoglitazar. Three preliminary phase I clinical pharmacology studies were conducted in tandem in healthy human subjects. Genotyping was undertaken in a total of 82 subjects in the phase I program for the purpose of genotyping UGT polymorphisms. Plasma samples were collected for up to 48 h post-dose to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile following a single oral dose of the drug. Plasma concentrations of sipoglitazar and the distribution of dose-normalized individual values for area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC(0-∞)) before any stratification were considerably skewed with a multi-modal distribution. The proportion of variability in AUC(0-∞) explained by UGT2B15 was 66.7 % (P < 0.0001); the addition of other genetic or demographic factors was not statistically significant. Subjects homozygous for the UGT2B15 D85Y variant (UGT2B15*2/*2) were exposed to greater plasma concentrations of sipoglitazar than subjects homozygous for the wild-type allele UGT2B15*1/*1 (3.26-fold higher) or heterozygous allele UGT2B15*1/*2 (2.16-fold higher). These results indicate that sipoglitazar clearance is substantially modified by UGT2B15 enzyme variants, with higher exposure observed in the UGT2B15*2/*2 genotype group.
22975224	PON1 status does not influence cholinesterase activity in Egyptian agricultural workers exposed to chlorpyrifos. Animal studies have shown that paraoxonase 1 (PON1) genotype can influence susceptibility to the organophosphorus pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF). However, Monte Carlo analysis suggests that PON1 genotype may not affect CPF-related toxicity at low exposure conditions in humans. The current study sought to determine the influence of PON1 genotype on the activity of blood cholinesterase as well as the effect of CPF exposure on serum PON1 in workers occupationally exposed to CPF. Saliva, blood and urine were collected from agricultural workers (n=120) from Egypt's Menoufia Governorate to determine PON1 genotype, blood cholinesterase activity, serum PON1 activity towards chlorpyrifos-oxon (CPOase) and paraoxon (POase), and urinary levels of the CPF metabolite 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPy). The PON1 55 (P≤0.05) but not the PON1 192 genotype had a significant effect on CPOase activity. However, both the PON1 55 (P≤0.05) and PON1 192 (P≤0.001) genotypes had a significant effect on POase activity. Workers had significantly inhibited AChE and BuChE after CPF application; however, neither CPOase activity nor POase activity was associated with ChE depression when adjusted for CPF exposure (as determined by urinary TCPy levels) and stratified by PON1 genotype. CPOase and POase activity were also generally unaffected by CPF exposure although there were alterations in activity within specific genotype groups. Together, these results suggest that workers retained the capacity to detoxify chlorpyrifos-oxon under the exposure conditions experienced by this study population regardless of PON1 genotype and activity and that effects of CPF exposure on PON1 activity are minimal.
22544644	Absorption, disposition, metabolic fate and elimination of the anti-epileptic drug lacosamide in humans: mass balance following intravenous and oral administration. The absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination of the anti-epileptic drug lacosamide were determined in 10 healthy male volunteers following intravenous or oral administration in a single-center, open-label, single-dose trial. Volunteers were randomized to receive either a continuous intravenous infusion of 100 mg (40 μCi) [¹⁴C]-lacosamide administered over 60 min, or a 100 mg (40 μCi) [¹⁴C]-lacosamide dose given as an oral solution. During the infusion, total radioactivity concentrations reached peak levels at 1 h post dose followed by a decline of 71 % within 24 h. More than 97 % of radioactivity was excreted within 168 h; 96.8 % in urine and 0.3 % in feces. Following oral administration, total radioactivity concentrations increased to peak levels within 0.5 h followed by a decline of 65 % within 24 h. Approximately 94.6 % of radioactivity was excreted within 168 h after oral administration, 94.2 % by the kidneys and 0.4% in feces. A comparison of AUC values (po/iv) of unchanged lacosamide indicates a high absolute bioavailability. The metabolic profile was analyzed using pooled urine samples, and following intravenous and oral administration, respectively, a total of 38 and 34 % unchanged lacosamide, 28 and 28 % of the desmethyl metabolite and 19 and 17 % of a polar fraction were measured. Additional metabolites were identified only in small amounts (<3 %). In plasma at maximum concentration, most of the total radioactivity was found as unchanged drug after intravenous and oral dose. The plasma concentration curves of total radioactivity following intravenous and oral administration were similar.
16891247	In vitro metabolism of the epoxide substructure of cryptophycins by cytosolic glutathione S-transferase: species differences and stereoselectivity. The enzyme kinetics of the glutathione (GSH) conjugation of cryptophycin 52 (C52, R-stereoisomer) and cryptophycin 53 (C53, S-stereoisomer) by cytosolic glutathione S-transferases (cGSTs) from human, rat, mouse, dog and monkey liver were studied. Vmax, Km, and CLint values for glutathione conjugation of C52 (R-stereoisomer) were 0.10 +/- 0.01 nmol min-1 mg-1, 3.24 +/- 0.23 microM, and (3.15 +/- 0.09) x 10(-2) ml min-1 mg-1, respectively, in human cytosol. Due to limited solubility relative to the Km, only CLint values were determined in rat ((7.76 +/- 0.10) x 10-2 ml min-1 mg-1) and mouse ((7.61 +/- 0.50) x 10(-2) ml min-1 mg-1) cytosol. Enzyme kinetic parameters could not be determined for C53 (S-stereoisomer). Microsomal GSH conjugation in human, rat, and mouse was attributed to cytosolic contamination. No GSH conjugation was seen in any biological matrix from dog or monkey. There was little GSH conjugation of C53 by cytosol or microsomes from any species. The metabolism of C52 and C53 by epoxide hydrolase was also investigated. No diol product was observed in any biological matrix from any species. Thus, cGSTs are primarily responsible for C52 metabolism.
21383096	Role of cathepsin A and lysosomes in the intracellular activation of novel antipapillomavirus agent GS-9191. GS-9191, a bis-amidate prodrug of the nucleotide analog 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)-N6-cyclopropyl-2,6-diaminopurine (cPrPMEDAP), was designed as a topical agent for the treatment of papillomavirus-associated proliferative disorders, such as genital warts. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of conversion of GS-9191 to cPrPMEDAP. We observed that GS-9191 is hydrolyzed in the presence of the lysosomal carboxypeptidase cathepsin A (CatA) in vitro and is less efficiently metabolized in CatA-deficient fibroblasts than in control cells. In addition, knockdown of CatA by small interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced the intracellular accumulation of GS-9191 metabolites. However, intracellular CatA levels did not correlate with the susceptibility of tested cell lines to GS-9191, indicating that the CatA step is unlikely to be rate limiting for the activation of GS-9191. Further analysis showed that upon the hydrolysis of the carboxylester bond in one of the GS-9191 amidate moieties, the unmasked carboxyl group displaces L-phenylalanine 2-methylpropyl ester from the other amidate moiety. The cPrPMEDAP-L-phenylalanine conjugate (cPrPMEDAP-Phe) formed is not metabolized by Hint1 (histidine triad nucleotide binding protein 1) phosphoramidase but undergoes spontaneous degradation to cPrPMEDAP in acidic pH that can be significantly enhanced by the addition of SiHa cell extract. Pretreatment of SiHa cells with bafilomycin A or chloroquine resulted in an 8-fold increase in the intracellular concentration of cPrPMEDAP-Phe metabolite and the accumulation of GS-9191 metabolites in the lysosomal/endosomal fraction. Together, these observations indicate that the conversion of GS-9191 to cPrPMEDAP occurs in lysosomes via CatA-mediated ester cleavage, followed by the release of cPrPMEDAP, most likely through the combination of enzyme-driven and spontaneous pH-driven hydrolysis of a cPrPMEDAP-Phe intermediate.
23030741	Identification of the metabolites of lesogaberan using linear trap quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometry and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography. 1. In this study, hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC), radiochemical activity monitoring and linear trap quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) were used to identify the metabolites of a highly polar novel γ-aminobutyric acid type-B receptor agonist, lesogaberan, in rats. 2. Urine was collected from three male Wistar rats for 24 h after dosing with (14)C-labelled lesogaberan (170 mg/kg, 10 MBq/kg); plasma samples were taken 2 and 24 h after dosing. Pooled samples were separated by HILIC and eluents were analysed by radiochemical activity monitoring, MS and MS/MS. 3. Only the parent compound was detected in plasma, but six metabolites (M1-M6) were detected in urine. Analysis of MS and MS/MS data and comparison with synthetic reference standards enabled the identification of the structure of each metabolite. M1 was identified as the N-acetylated species [(2R)-3-acetamido-2-fluoropropyl]-phosphinic acid, and M6 as [(2R)-3-amino-2-fluoropropyl]-phosphonic acid. Metabolites M2 and M5 were the alcohol and carboxylic acid species 3-hydroxypropyl-phosphinic acid and 3-hydroxyphosphonoyl-propanoic acid, respectively, both of which had lost the fluorine atom present in the parent compound. M3 was the corresponding carboxylic acid species retaining the fluorine atom, (2R)-2-fluoro-3-hydroxyphosphonoyl-propanoic acid. Finally M4 was identified as [(2R)-2-fluoro-3-guanidino-propyl]-phosphinic acid.
15966464	Multiple-dose pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and tolerability of the oral ET(A) endothelin-receptor antagonist SPP301 in man. SPP301 is a competitive antagonist of ET-1 with a high selectivity for the ET(A) receptor. The multiple-dose pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability of SPP301 were investigated in healthy male subjects. In an ascending-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial doses of 5, 20, 40 and 60 mg SPP301 were given orally on Day 1 and, after a wash-out period of 48 hours, once daily for seven days. At regular intervals, blood pressure and pulse rate, plasma levels of ET-1, and of SPP301 and its hydroxymethyl metabolite as well as urinary excretion of the parent drug and its metabolite were determined. SPP301 was generally well-tolerated. With the higher doses asymptomatic and transient increases in liver transaminases were observed. No other clinically relevant effects of SPP301 on hematology, biochemistry or urinalysis parameters were observed. Vital signs, ECG parameters and physical examinations showed no time or treatment effect. The pharmacokinetics of SPP301 and its hydroxymethyl metabolite (Ro 68-5925) were linear up to 40 mg SPP301. Steady state was reached after 3-4 days. The apparent terminal half-life of SPP301 and the metabolite was in the range of 7-10 hours after single and repeated doses. At the 60 mg dose level plasma concentrations of SPP301 decreased from the first to the last day of oral treatment. The average decreases in Cmax and AUC were 33% and 37%, respectively. Cmax and AUC of the metabolite amounted to about 4-6% of the values for SPP301 under single and repeated-dose conditions. Urinary excretion of SPP301 and of its metabolite were below 0.1% and 5%, respectively. SPP301 is quite well-tolerated, pharmacokinetics are linear and time-independent up to 40 mg multiple doses. Steady state is reached after 3-4 days. Urinary excretion of the unchanged drug plays a minor role in the elimination process of SPP301. ET-1 plasma concentrations increased about 1.5-fold at 20 mg and all further doses.
20423954	Identification of novel metoclopramide metabolites in humans: in vitro and in vivo studies. Metoclopramide (MCP) is frequently used to treat gastroparesis. Previous studies have documented MCP metabolism, but systematic structural identification of metabolites has not been performed. The aim of this study was to better understand MCP metabolism in humans. For examination of in vivo metabolism, a single oral 20-mg MCP dose was administered to eight healthy male volunteers, followed by complete urine collection over 24 h. In vitro incubations were performed in human liver microsomes (HLM) to characterize metabolism via cytochromes P450 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases and in human liver cytosol for metabolism via sulfotransferases. Urine and subcellular incubations were analyzed for MCP metabolites on a mass spectrometer with accurate mass measurement capability. Five MCP metabolites were detected in vivo, and five additional metabolites were detected in vitro. The five metabolites of MCP identified both in vitro and in vivo were an N-O-glucuronide (M1), an N-sulfate (M2), a des-ethyl metabolite (M3), a hydroxylated metabolite (M4), and an oxidative deaminated metabolite (M5). To our knowledge, metabolites M1 and M4 have not been reported previously. M2 urinary levels varied 22-fold and M3 levels varied 16-fold among eight subjects. In vitro studies in HLM revealed the following additional metabolites: two ether glucuronides (M6 and M8), possibly on the phenyl ring after oxidation, an N-glucuronide (M7), a carbamic acid (M9), and a nitro metabolite (M10). Metabolites M6 to M10 have not been reported previously. In conclusion, this study describes the identification of MCP metabolites in vivo and in vitro in humans.
18777946	Antihistaminic effects of rupatadine and PKPD modelling. Rupatadine is a new oral antihistaminic agent used for the management of allergic inflammatory conditions, such as rhinitis and chronic urticaria. The aim of the present study was to develop a population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model for the description of the effect of rupatadine and one of its active metabolites, desloratadine, on the histamine-induced flare reaction and to predict the response to treatment after repeated administrations of rupatadine. Both rupatadine and desloratadine were characterized by two-compartmental kinetics. For both compounds, covariates sex and weight had a significant effect on several parameters. The pharmacodynamics were described by an indirect model for the inhibition of flare formation that accounted for the contribution of both rupatadine and desloratadine to the antihistaminic effect. The final PKPD model adequately described the original data. The simulated response after repeated once-daily administrations of 10 mg rupatadine showed a significant and maintained antihistaminic effect over time, between two consecutive dosing intervals.
19744901	Simultaneous determination of AZD1152 (prodrug) and AZD1152-hydroxyquinazoline pyrazol anilide by reversed phase liquid chromatography. A simple, selective and sensitive reversed phase liquid chromatography method utilizing ultraviolet detection has been developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of the prodrug AZD1152 and its active product AZD1152-hydroxyquinazoline pyrazol anilide (hQPA) in human and mouse plasma and mouse tissues. Isocratic separation was achieved using an 5mum UptiSphere HDO C-18 column (150 mm x 4.6 mm) with guard column in combination with a mobile phase comprised of phosphate buffered water (50 mM; pH 3.4) and acetonitrile (81.5: 18.5; v/v). UV detection at 318 nm was used. Sample preparation involved a single-step protein precipitation with ethanol. Ex vivo conversion of AZD1152 by endogenous phosphatases was prevented by immediate cooling of the samples in ice-water and addition of sodium fluoride and EDTA. The validation parameters included specificity, recovery, accuracy, precision, sensitivity and stability. The lower limit of quantification in human plasma for AZD1152 and hQPA was 25 ng/ml. The applicability of the method was demonstrated by successful determination of AZD1152 and hQPA in human plasma and in plasma, brain, liver, kidney and ileum samples from mice dosed with AZD1152.
19142178	Influence of comedication on serum concentrations of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole. Aripiprazole, a relatively new antipsychotic drug, is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and CYP2D6 to an active metabolite, dehydroaripiprazole. As studies on pharmacokinetic drug interactions with aripiprazole are so far limited, the aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of comedication on serum concentrations of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole in psychiatric patients in a clinical setting. A therapeutic drug monitoring database was screened for patients receiving aripiprazole tablets as part of their treatment. Of the 361 samples included, 78% were from patients receiving comedication. The remaining 79 samples constituted the control group. Steady-state dose-adjusted serum concentrations (concentration to dose ratios, C:D ratios) of aripiprazole, dehydroaripiprazole and the sum of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole, and the metabolic ratio (dehydroaripiprazole/aripiprazole) in the different comedication groups were compared with controls. Coadministration of a CYP3A4 inducer resulted in approximately 60% lower mean C:D ratios of aripiprazole, dehydroaripiprazole, and the sum of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole (P < 0.05, P < 0.01, and P < 0.01, respectively). Combination with a CYP2D6 inhibitor resulted in a 45% higher mean C:D ratio of aripiprazole (P < 0.05), with no effect on the C:D ratio of dehydroaripiprazole. When aripiprazole was coadministered with alimemazine or lithium, a 56% (P < 0.01) and 43% (P = 0.05) higher mean C:D ratio of aripiprazole, respectively, was observed. Olanzapine, risperidone injections, escitalopram, or lamotrigine also had statistically significant effects on aripiprazole disposition but to a lesser extent. In conclusion, concurrent treatment with CYP3A4 inducers, CYP2D6 inhibitors, alimemazine, or lithium resulted in changes in the systemic exposure of aripiprazole between 40% and 60%. This is of such a magnitude that dose adjustments of aripiprazole may be required.
20012293	A phase I trial of PR-104, a nitrogen mustard prodrug activated by both hypoxia and aldo-keto reductase 1C3, in patients with solid tumors. PR-104 is a "pre-prodrug" designed to be activated to a dinitrobenzamide nitrogen mustard cytotoxin by nitroreduction in hypoxic regions of tumors. This study was conducted to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of PR-104 in patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients with solid tumors refractory or not amenable to conventional treatment were evaluated in a dose-escalation trial of PR-104 administered as a 1-h intravenous (IV) infusion every 3 weeks. The plasma PK of PR-104 and its primary metabolite, PR-104A, were evaluated. Twenty-seven patients received a median of two cycles of PR-104 in doses ranging from 135 to 1,400 mg/m(2). The MTD of PR-104 as a single-dose infusion every 3 weeks was established as 1,100 mg/m(2). One of six patients treated at 1,100 mg/m(2) experienced DLT of grade 3 fatigue. Above the MTD, the DLTs at 1,400 mg/m(2) were febrile neutropenia and infection with normal absolute neutrophil count. No objective responses were observed, although reductions in tumor size were observed in patients treated at doses > or = 550 mg/m(2). The plasma PK of PR-104 demonstrated rapid conversion to PR-104A, with approximately dose-linear PK of both species. PR-104 was well tolerated at a dose of 1,100 mg/m(2) administered as an IV infusion every 3 weeks. The area under the PR-104A plasma concentration-time curve at this dose exceeded that required for activity in human tumor cell cultures and xenograft models. The recommended dose of PR-104 as a single agent for phase II trials is 1,100 mg/m(2) and further trials are underway.
21084760	Evaluation of pharmaceutical excipients as cosolvents in 4-methyl umbelliferone glucuronidation in human liver microsomes: applications for compounds with low solubility. Standard incubation procedures for carrying out microsomal assays involve the use of less than 1% w/v organic solvents to minimize the potential inhibitory effects of organic solvents on metabolic activity. This presents a practical limitation for poorly soluble xenobiotics, which cannot be incubated at concentrations high enough to obtain a V(max), and therefore subsequent values for K(m) and Cl(int) cannot be calculated. Our goal was to study the application of a variety of pharmaceutical excipients to aid the solubilization of compounds in vitro in glucuronidation incubations, without affecting the reaction kinetics. In vitro glucuronidation incubations were carried out in human liver microsomes with 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) and the kinetics of 4-MU glucuronidation in the presence of excipients were compared to that in control incubations without any excipients. In addition, IC(75) values were calculated for each excipient. We observed that HPBCD (Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin) may be employed in in vitro glucuronidation incubations up to 0.5% w/v without affecting the Cl(int) of 4-MU. Although NMP (N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone) and DMA (N,N-dimethylacetamide); showed low IC(75) values approximately 0.1% w/v each, neither excipients altered the Cl(int) of 4-MUG (4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-glucuronide) formation. Our studies point toward possible applications of pharmaceutical excipients to carry out in vitro glucuronidation of substrates with poor aqueous solubility, in order to estimate Cl(int) and subsequently scaled organ clearance values.
20870468	Quantitation of sorafenib and its active metabolite sorafenib N-oxide in human plasma by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A simple and rapid method with high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry is described for the quantitation of the kinase inhibitor sorafenib and its active metabolite sorafenib N-oxide in human plasma. A protein precipitation extraction procedure was applied to 50 μL of plasma. Chromatographic separation of the two analytes, and the internal standard [(2)H(3)(13)C]-sorafenib, was achieved on a C(18) analytical column and isocratic flow at 0.3 mL/min for 4 min. Mean within-run and between-run precision for all analytes were <6.9% and accuracy was <5.3%. Calibration curves were linear over the concentration range of 50-10,000 ng/mL for sorafenib and 10-2500 ng/mL for sorafenib N-oxide. This method allows a specific, sensitive, and reliable determination of the kinase inhibitor sorafenib and its active metabolite sorafenib N-oxide in human plasma in a single analytical run.
22419259	Attenuation of phosphorylation by deoxycytidine kinase is key to acquired gemcitabine resistance in a pancreatic cancer cell line: targeted proteomic and metabolomic analyses in PK9 cells. Multiple proteins are involved in activation and inactivation of 2',2'-difluorodeoxycytidine (gemcitabine, dFdC). We aimed to clarify the mechanism of dFdC resistance in a pancreatic cancer cell line by applying a combination of targeted proteomic and metabolomic analyses. Twenty-five enzyme and transporter proteins and 6 metabolites were quantified in sensitive and resistant pancreatic cancer cell lines, PK9 and RPK9, respectively. The protein concentration of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) in RPK9 cells was less than 0.02-fold (2 %) compared with that in PK9 cells, whereas the differences (fold) were within a factor of 3 for other proteins. Targeted metabolomic analysis revealed that phosphorylated forms of dFdC were reduced to less than 0.2 % in RPK9 cells. The extracellular concentration of 2',2'-difluorodeoxyuridine (dFdU), an inactive metabolite of dFdC, reached the same level as the initial dFdC concentration in RPK9 cells. However, tetrahydrouridine treatment did not increase phosphorylated forms of dFdC and did not reverse dFdC resistance in RPK9 cells, though this treatment inhibits production of dFdU. Combining targeted proteomics and metabolomics suggests that acquisition of resistance in RPK9 cells is due to attenuation of dFdC phosphorylation via suppression of dCK.
19428930	Metabolism and cytotoxic effects of T-2 toxin and its metabolites on human cells in primary culture. T-2 toxin belongs to the large group of trichothecene mycotoxins synthesized by various Fusarium molds which can infect raw agriculture materials. Among the trichothecenes, T-2 toxin is one of the most potent mycotoxins and poses a potential health risk in human nutrition. Several acute and chronic toxic effects were observed in humans after consumption of contaminated food. Due to the rapid metabolism of T-2 toxin by esterases, several metabolites can be found in food and also in vivo after ingestion. The aim of this work was to determine the effects of T-2 toxin and of several of its metabolites, namely HT-2 toxin, neosolaniol, T-2-triol and T-2 tetraol, on two human cells in primary culture: human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTEC) and normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLF). Concerning the cytotoxicity of T-2 toxin and its metabolites, different studies were performed with animal cells and cell lines but there are only little data about cytotoxic effects in human cells. The use of human cells in primary culture gives a good completion of the already known data because these might be limited due to the disadvantages of cell lines (e.g., immortalization, tumor derivation, longtime cultivation). In order to study the cytotoxicity and mode of cell death, the parameters cell viability, caspase-3-activity and LDH-release were measured after exposure to T-2 toxin and several of its metabolites. With IC(50) values of 0.2 and 0.5 microM T-2 toxin showed the strongest cytotoxic effect in both cells with triggering apoptosis as kind of cell death starting at a concentration of 100nM. The metabolites HT-2 toxin and neosolaniol revealed weaker cytotoxic effects (IC(50): 0.7-3.0 microM) and induced apoptosis at higher concentrations (>1 microM). The other metabolites were less cytotoxic (IC(50): 8.3-25.1 microM) and did not activate caspase-3. In addition to the analysis of cytotoxic effects, we also studied the metabolism of T-2 toxin in these cells in primary culture. Using LC-ESI-MS/MS we could demonstrate that both cells are able to transform T-2 toxin into HT-2 toxin. Further metabolic activity could only be observed in renal proximal tubule (RPTEC) cells by forming neosolaniol as a second metabolite.
17477947	The environmental carcinogen 3-nitrobenzanthrone and its main metabolite 3-aminobenzanthrone enhance formation of reactive oxygen intermediates in human A549 lung epithelial cells. The environmental contaminant 3-nitrobenzanthrone (3-NBA) is highly mutagenic and a suspected human carcinogen. We aimed to evaluate whether 3-NBA is able to deregulate critical steps in cell cycle control and apoptosis in human lung epithelial A549 cells. Increased intracellular Ca(2+) and caspase activities were detected upon 3-NBA exposure. As shown by cell cycle analysis, an increased number of S-phase cells was observed after 24 h of treatment with 3-NBA. Furthermore, 3-NBA was shown to inhibit cell proliferation when added to subconfluent cell cultures. The main metabolite of 3-NBA, 3-ABA, induced statistically significant increases in tail moment as judged by alkaline comet assay. The potential of 3-NBA and 3-ABA to enhance the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was demonstrated by flow cytometry using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate (DCFH-DA). The enzyme inhibitors allopurinol, dicumarol, resveratrol and SKF525A were used to assess the impact of metabolic conversion on 3-NBA-mediated ROS production. Resveratrol decreased dichlorofluorescein (DCF) fluorescence by 50%, suggesting a role for CYP1A1 in 3-NBA-mediated ROS production. Mitochondrial ROS production was significantly attenuated (20% reduction) by addition of rotenone (complex I inhibition) and thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA, complex II inhibition). Taken together, the results of the present study provide evidence for a genotoxic potential of 3-ABA in human epithelial lung cells. Moreover, both compounds lead to increased intracellular ROS and create an environment favorable to DNA damage and the promotion of cancer.
23111980	Regional gastrointestinal delivery of remogliflozin etabonate in humans. Remogliflozin etabonate (RE) is the prodrug of remogliflozin (R), an inhibitor of renal glucose transport designed to reduce blood glucose concentrations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. This open-label, randomized, single-dose, four-way crossover study, (with one add-on arm) in eight healthy men evaluated the regional gastrointestinal absorption of RE, the systemic appearance of the active entity R, and an active metabolite, GSK279782. The InteliSite(®) Companion Capsule was used to administer a single dose of RE 100 mg to the mid-small intestine or cecum/colon. Oral administration of the IR tablet of RE showed similar bioavailability of R compared with small intestine delivery with both suspension and solution. The lowest bioavailability of remogliflozin was found with large intestine delivery and therefore not a suitable region for prodrug delivery. Although both lower permeability and decreased ester hydrolysis of remogliflozin etabonate in the colon can explain reduced plasma exposures of remogliflozin, the data suggest relatively limited remogliflozin etabonate hydrolysis in the colon and provides evidence for a diminishing gradient of esterase activity from small to large intestine.
21177985	In vitro metabolism of 17-(dimethylaminoethylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin in human liver microsomes. The objective of this study was to investigate the oxidative metabolism pathways of 17-(dimethylaminoethylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG), a geldanamycin (GA) derivative and 90-kDa heat shock protein inhibitor. In vitro metabolic profiles of 17-DMAG were examined by using pooled human liver microsomes (HLMs) and recombinant CYP450 isozymes in the presence or absence of reduced GSH. In addition to 17-DMAG hydroquinone and 19-glutathionyl 17-DMAG, several oxidative metabolites of 17-DMAG were detected and characterized by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Different from previously reported primary biotransformations of GA and GA derivatives, 17-DMAG was not metabolized primarily through the reduction of benzoquinone and GSH conjugation in HLMs. In contrast, the primary biotransformations of 17-DMAG in HLMs were hydroxylation and demethylation on its side chains. The most abundant metabolite was produced by demethylation from the methoxyl at position 12. The reaction phenotyping study showed that CYP3A4 and 3A5 were the major cytochrome P450 isozymes involved in the oxidative metabolism of 17-DMAG, whereas CYP2C8, 2D6, 2A6, 2C19, and 1A2 made minor contributions to the formation of metabolites. On the basis of the identified metabolite profiles, the biotransformation pathways for 17-DMAG in HLMs were proposed.
21045201	CYP4F enzymes are responsible for the elimination of fingolimod (FTY720), a novel treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis. Fingolimod (FTY720, Gilenya, 2-amino-2-[2-(4-octylphenyl)ethyl]-1,3-propanediol) is a novel drug recently approved in the United States for the oral treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis. The compound is eliminated predominantly by ω-hydroxylation, followed by further oxidation. The ω-hydroxylation was the major metabolic pathway in human liver microsomes (HLM). The enzyme kinetics in HLM were characterized by a Michaelis-Menten affinity constant (K(m)) of 183 μM and a maximum velocity (V(max)) of 1847 pmol/(min · mg). Rates of fingolimod metabolism by a panel of HLM from individual donors showed no correlation with marker activities of any of the major drug-metabolizing cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes or of flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO). Among 21 recombinant human P450 enzymes and FMO3, only CYP4F2 (and to some extent CYP4F3B) produced metabolite profiles similar to those in HLM. Ketoconazole, known to inhibit not only CYP3A but also CYP4F2, was an inhibitor of fingolimod metabolism in HLM with an inhibition constant (K(i)) of 0.74 μM (and by recombinant CYP4F2 with an IC(50) of 1.6 μM), whereas there was only a slight inhibition found with azamulin and none with troleandomycin. An antibody against CYP4F2 was able to inhibit the metabolism of fingolimod almost completely in HLM, whereas antibodies specific to CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 did not show significant inhibition. Combining the results of these four enzyme phenotyping approaches, we demonstrated that CYP4F2 and possibly other enzymes of the CYP4F subfamily (e.g., CYP4F3B) are the major enzymes responsible for the ω-hydroxylation of fingolimod, the main elimination pathway of the drug in vivo.
22864876	Phase I study of the Aurora B kinase inhibitor barasertib (AZD1152) to assess the pharmacokinetics, metabolism and excretion in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Barasertib (AZD1152) is a pro-drug that rapidly undergoes phosphatase-mediated cleavage in serum to release barasertib-hQPA, a selective Aurora B kinase inhibitor that has shown preliminary activity in clinical studies of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The pharmacokinetic (PK), metabolic and excretion profiles of barasertib and barasertib-hQPA were characterized in this open-label Phase I study. Five patients with poor prognosis AML (newly diagnosed, relapsed or refractory) received barasertib 1,200 mg as a 7-day continuous infusion every 28 days. On Day 2 of Cycle 1 only, patients also received a 2-hour infusion of [(14)C]-barasertib. Blood, urine and feces samples were collected at various time points during Cycle 1. Safety and preliminary efficacy were also assessed. Barasertib-hQPA was extensively distributed to tissues, with a slow rate of total clearance (CL = 31.4 L/h). Overall, 72-82 % of radioactivity was recovered, with approximately double the amount recovered in feces (mean = 51 %) compared with urine (mean = 27 %). The main metabolism pathways for barasertib were (1) cleavage of the phosphate group to form barasertib-hQPA, followed by oxidation and (2) loss of the fluoroaniline moiety to form barasertib-hQPA desfluoroaniline, followed by oxidation. One of the four patients evaluable for response entered complete remission. No new or unexpected safety findings were observed; the most common adverse events were nausea and stomatitis. The PK profile of barasertib is similar to previous studies using the same dosing regimen in patients with AML. The majority of barasertib-hQPA clearance occurred via hepatic metabolic routes.
20332199	Identification of the human enzymes responsible for the enzymatic hydrolysis of aclidinium bromide. Aclidinium bromide [LAS34273, 3R-(2-hydroxy-2,2-dithiophen-2-yl-acetoxy)-1-(3-phenoxy-propyl)1-azonia bicycle-[2.2.2]-octane bromide], a novel, long-acting, inhaled muscarinic antagonist for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, has shown rapid hydrolysis in human and animal plasma. This process occurred both nonenzymatically (k(h), 0.0075 min(-1)) and enzymatically. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the in vitro enzymatic hydrolysis of aclidinium in humans. Human butyrylcholinesterase was identified as the most important esterase responsible for the enzymatic hydrolysis of aclidinium from inhibition studies in human plasma with selective paraoxonase, arylesterase, carboxylesterase, acetylcholinesterase, and butyrylcholinesterase chemical inhibitors, as well as from incubations with pure human cholinesterases. Furthermore, neither human cytochrome P450 nor human serum albumin participated in the enzymatic ester cleavage of aclidinium. Butyrylcholinesterase activity in the human lung was lower than that observed in human plasma. Aclidinium was shown to inhibit competitively both human butyrylcholinesterase (K(i), 2.7 microM) and acetylcholinesterase (6.3 microM) but did not have any effect on the activity of other human esterases, as well as its hydrolysis metabolites. These results suggest that the potential for clinical interactions involving human cholinesterases is remote at clinically relevant plasma, which are less than 1 nM.
16415119	Interactions of two major metabolites of prasugrel, a thienopyridine antiplatelet agent, with the cytochromes P450. The biotransformation of prasugrel to R-138727 (2-[1-2-cyclopropyl-1-(2-fluorophenyl)-2-oxoethyl]-4-mercapto-3-piperidinylidene]acetic acid) involves rapid deesterification to R-95913 (2-[2-oxo-6,7-dihydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridin-5(4H)-yl]-1-cyclopropyl-2-(2-fluorophenyl)ethanone) followed by cytochrome P450 (P450)-mediated formation of R-138727, the metabolite responsible for platelet aggregation. For identification of the P450s responsible for the formation of the active metabolite, the current studies were conducted with R-95913 as the substrate. Incubations required supplementation with reduced glutathione. Hyperbolic kinetics (K(m) 21-30 microM), consistent with a single enzyme predominating, were observed after incubations with human liver microsomes. Correlation analyses revealed a strong relationship between R-138727 formation and CYP3A-mediated midazolam 1'-hydroxylation (r(2) = 0.98; p < 0.001) in a bank of characterized human liver microsomal samples. The human lymphoblast-expressed enzymes capable of forming R-138727, in rank order of rates, were CYP3A4>CYP2B6>CYP2C19 approximately CYP2C9>CYP2D6. A monoclonal antibody to CYP2B6 and the CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole substantially inhibited R-138727 formation, whereas inhibitors of CYP2C9 (sulfaphenazole) and CYP2C19 (omeprazole) did not. Scaling of in vitro intrinsic clearance values from expressed enzymes to the whole liver using a relative abundance approach indicated that either CYP3A4 alone or CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 are the major contributors to R-138727 formation. R-95913 and R-138727 were also examined for their ability to inhibit metabolism mediated by five P450s. R-138727 did not inhibit the P450s tested. In vitro, R-95913 inhibited CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A, with K(i) values ranging from 7.2 microM to 82 microM, but did not inhibit CYP1A2. These K(i) values exceed circulating concentrations in humans by 3.8- to 43-fold. Therefore, neither R-95913 nor R-138727 is expected to substantially inhibit the P450-mediated metabolism of coadministered drugs.
21346002	Metabolism of the c-Fos/activator protein-1 inhibitor T-5224 by multiple human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase isoforms. We developed 3-{5-[4-(cyclopentyloxy)-2-hydroxybenzoyl]-2-[(3-hydroxy-1,2-benzisoxazol-6-yl)methoxy]phenyl} propionic acid (T-5224) as a novel inhibitor of the c-Fos/activator protein-1 for rheumatoid arthritis therapy. We predicted the metabolism of T-5224 in humans by using human liver microsomes (HLM), human intestinal microsomes (HIM), recombinant human cytochrome P450 (P450), and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs). T-5224 was converted to its acyl O-glucuronide (G2) by UGT1A1 and UGT1A3 and to its hydroxyl O-glucuronide (G3) by several UGTs, but it was not metabolized by the P450s. A comparison of the intrinsic clearances (CL(int)) between HLM and HIM suggested that the glucuronidation of T-5224 occurs predominantly in the liver. UGT1A1 showed a higher k(cat)/K(m) value than UGT1A3 for G2 formation, but a lower k(cat)/K(m) value than UGT1A3 for G3 formation. A high correlation was observed between G2 formation activity and UGT1A1-specific activity (β-estradiol 3-glucuronidation) in seven individual HLM. A high correlation was also observed between G2 formation activity and UGT1A1 content in the HLM. These results strongly suggest that UGT1A1 is responsible for G2 formation in human liver. In contrast, no such correlation was observed with G3 formation, suggesting that multiple UGT isoforms, including UGT1A1 and UGT1A3, are involved in G3 formation. G2 is also observed in rat and monkey liver microsomes as a major metabolite of T-5224, suggesting that G2 is not a human-specific metabolite. In this study, we obtained useful information on the metabolism of T-5224 for its clinical use.
19841149	Pharmacokinetics of artemether-lumefantrine and artesunate-amodiaquine in children in Kampala, Uganda. The World Health Organization recommends the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria. The two most widely adopted ACT regimens are artemether (AR)-lumefantrine (LR) (the combination is abbreviated AL) and amodiaquine (AQ)-artesunate (AS). Pharmacokinetic (PK) data informing the optimum dosing of these drug regimens is limited, especially in children. We evaluated PK parameters in Ugandan children aged 5 to 13 years with uncomplicated malaria treated with AL (n = 20) or AQ-AS (n = 21), with intensive venous sampling occurring at 0, 2, 4, 8, 24, and 120 h following administration of the last dose of 3-day regimens of AL (twice daily) or AQ-AS (once daily). AS achieved an estimated maximum concentration in plasma (C(max)) of 51 ng/ml and an area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC(0-infinity)) of 113 ng.h/ml; and its active metabolite, dihydroartemisinin (DHA), achieved a geometric mean C(max) of 473 ng/ml and an AUC(0-infinity) of 1,404 ng.h/ml. AR-DHA exhibited a C(max) of 34/119 ng/ml and an AUC(0-infinity) of 168/382 ng.h/ml, respectively. For LR, C(max) and AUC(0-infinity) were 6,757 ng/ml and 210 microg.h/ml, respectively. For AQ and its active metabolite, desethylamodiaquine (DEAQ), the C(max)s were 5.2 ng/ml and 235 ng/ml, respectively, and the AUC(0-infinity)s were 39.3 ng.h/ml and 148 microg.h/ml, respectively. Comparison of the findings of the present study to previously published data for adults suggests that the level of exposure to LR is lower in children than in adults and that the level of AQ-DEAQ exposure is similar in children and adults. For the artemisinin derivatives, differences between children and adults were variable and drug specific. The PK results generated for children must be considered to optimize the dosing strategies for these widely utilized ACT regimens.
15618697	Formation of a structurally novel, serial diglucuronide of 4-hydroxybiphenyl by further glucuronidation of a monoglucuronide in dog liver microsomes. Incubation of 4-hydroxybiphenyl (p-phenylphenol) in the presence of UDP-glucuronic acid (UDPGA) with liver microsomes from male and female dogs produced a more polar metabolite peak than a simultaneously produced peak of 4-hydroxybiphenyl monoglucuronide in the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) chromatogram. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses revealed this polar metabolite as a 4-hydroxybiphenyl diglucuronide having a beta-D-glucuronopyranosyl-(1-->2)-beta-D-glucuronopyranosyl moiety, where the two glucuronic acids are connected directly at the 1''-->2' position. Liver microsomes from Sprague-Dawley rat, cynomolgus monkey and human, converted 4-hydroxybiphenyl only to the monoglucuronide, suggesting that there is a dog UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT), with a wider substrate specificity capable of glucuronidating 4-hydroxybiphenyl monoglucuronide to the diglucuronide.
22572482	Identification and characterization of human UDP-glucuronosyltransferases responsible for the in vitro glucuronidation of salvianolic acid A. Glucuronidation is an important pathway in the elimination of salvianolic acid A (Sal A); however the mechanism of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) in this process remains to be investigated. In this study, the kinetics of Sal A glucuronidation by pooled human liver microsomes (HLMs), pooled human intestinal microsomes (HIMs) and 12 recombinant UGT isozymes were investigated. The glucuronidation of Sal A can be shown both in HLMs and HIMs with K(m) values of 39.84 ± 3.76 and 54.04 ± 4.36 µM, respectively. Among the 12 human UGTs investigated, UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 were the major isoforms that catalyzed the glucuronidation of Sal A (K(m) values of 29.72 ± 2.20 and 24.40 ± 2.60 µM). UGT1A9 showed the highest affinity of Sal A glucuronidation. Furthermore, a significant correlation between Sal A glucuronidation and propofol glucuronidation (a typical UGT1A9 substrate) was observed. The chemical inhibition study showed that the IC(50) for phenylbutazone inhibition of Sal A glucuronidation was 50.3 ± 4.3 and 39.4 ± 2.9 µM by HLMs and UGT1A9, respectively. Mefenamic acid inhibited Sal A glucuronidation in UGT1A1 and HLMs with IC(50) values of >200 and 12.4 ± 2.2 µM, respectively.
21336936	Gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry determination of phthalic acid in human urine as a biomarker of folpet exposure. Agricultural workers are exposed to folpet, but biomonitoring data are limited. Phthalimide (PI), phthalamic acid (PAA), and phthalic acid (PA) are the ring metabolites of this fungicide according to animal studies, but they have not yet been measured in human urine as metabolites of folpet, only PA as a metabolite of phthalates. The objective of this study was thus to develop a reliable gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method to quantify the sum of PI, PAA, and PA ring-metabolites of folpet in human urine. Briefly, the method consisted of adding p-methylhippuric acid as an internal standard, performing an acid hydrolysis at 100 °C to convert ring-metabolites into PA, purifying samples by ethyl acetate extraction, and derivatizing with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoro acetamide prior to GC-MS analysis. The method had a detection limit of 60.2 nmol/L (10 ng/mL); it was found to be accurate (mean recovery, 97%), precise (inter- and intra-day percentage relative standard deviations <13%), and with a good linearity (R (2) > 0.98). Validation was conducted using unexposed peoples urine spiked at concentrations ranging from 4.0 to 16.1 μmol/L, along with urine samples of volunteers dosed with folpet, and of exposed workers. The method proved to be (1) suitable and accurate to determine the kinetic profile of PA equivalents in the urine of volunteers orally and dermally administered folpet and (2) relevant for the biomonitoring of exposure in workers.
19275157	Conversion of dehydrodiferulic acids by human intestinal microbiota. Plant cell wall associated dehydrodiferulic acids (DFA) are abundant components of cereal insoluble dietary fibers ingested by humans. The ability of human intestinal microbiota to convert DFA was studied in vitro by incubating 8-O-4- and 5-5-coupled DFA with fecal suspensions. 8-O-4-DFA was completely degraded by the intestinal microbiota of the majority of donors, yielding homovanillic acid, 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)propionic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid as the main metabolites. The transient formation of ferulic acid and presumably 3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)pyruvic acid suggests an initial cleavage of the ether bond. In contrast to 8-O-4-DFA, the 5-5-coupled DFA was not cleaved into monomers by any of the fecal suspensions. Only the side chains were hydrogenated and the methoxy groups were demethylated. The cleavage of DFA by human intestinal microbiota, which depended on their coupling type, may affect both the bioavailability of DFA and the degradability of DFA-coupled fiber in the gut.
14742141	Hepatic metabolism of diallyl disulphide in rat and man. 1. The metabolism of diallyl disulphide was investigated in vitro with rat and human liver cell subfractions and ex vivo with an isolated perfused rat liver. 2. Diallyl disulphide was oxidized to diallylthiosulphinate by rat liver microsomes with an apparent K(m) = 0.86 +/- 0.1 mM and an apparent V(max) = 0.47 +/- 0.12 nmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein (mean +/- SE). Both cytochrome P450 (CYP) and flavin-containing monooxygenases were involved, with CYP2B1/2 and CYP2E1 being the most active CYP enzymes. 3. In rat and man, microsomal oxidation of allylmethyl sulphide to allylmethyl sulphoxide and allylmethyl sulphone also occurred, although at a low rate. Diallyl disulphide was also metabolized to allylglutathione sulphide and allylmercaptan. In addition, diallylthiosulphinate reacted non-enzymatically with glutathione to form allylglutathione sulphide. 4. When an isolated rat liver was perfused with diallyl disulphide, the metabolites allyl mercaptan, allylmethyl sulphide, allylmethyl sulphoxide, allylmethyl sulphone and allylglutathione sulphide were detected primarily within the liver tissue, with only small amounts of metabolites found in the bile and perfusion medium. The pharmacokinetic parameters for diallyl disulphide were t(1/2) = 6.09 min; AUC(0- infinity ) = 4.77 min mmol l(-1); clearance = 34.22 ml min(-1). 5. A scheme for the metabolism of diallyl disulphide in rat and man is proposed.
16951237	A phase I pharmacokinetic study of HMN-214, a novel oral stilbene derivative with polo-like kinase-1-interacting properties, in patients with advanced solid tumors. HMN-214 is an oral prodrug of HMN-176, a stilbene derivative that interferes with the subcellular spatial location of polo-like kinase-1, a serine/threonine kinase that regulates critical mitotic events. We conducted a dose escalation study of HMN-214 in patients with advanced cancer to assess the safety profile and pharmacokinetics of HMN-214 and to establish the maximum tolerated dose. Thirty-three patients were enrolled onto four dosing cohorts of HMN-214 from 3 to 9.9 mg/m2/d using a continuous 21-day dosing schedule every 28 days, with pharmacokinetic sampling during cycle 1. A severe myalgia/bone pain syndrome and hyperglycemia were dose-limiting toxicities at 9.9 mg/m2/d. A dose reduction and separate enrollment by pretreatment status (lightly versus heavily pretreated) was undertaken, with one dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3 bone pain) at 8 mg/m2/d. The maximum tolerated dose was defined as 8 mg/m2/d for both treatment cohorts. Dose-proportional increases were observed in AUC but not Cmax. There was no accumulation of HMN-176, the metabolite of HMN-214, with repeated dosing. Seven of 29 patients had stable disease as best tumor response, including 6-month stable disease in a heavily pretreated breast cancer patient. A transient decline in carcinoembryonic antigen in a patient with colorectal cancer was noted. The maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of HMN-214 when administered on this schedule was 8 mg/m2/d regardless of pretreatment status. Further development of HMN-214 will focus on patient populations for which high expression of polo-like kinase-1 is seen (i.e., prostate and pancreatic cancer patients).
17709372	Human enteric microsomal CYP4F enzymes O-demethylate the antiparasitic prodrug pafuramidine. CYP4F enzymes, including CYP4F2 and CYP4F3B, were recently shown to be the major enzymes catalyzing the initial oxidative O-demethylation of the antiparasitic prodrug pafuramidine (DB289) by human liver microsomes. As suggested by a low oral bioavailability, DB289 could undergo first-pass biotransformation in the intestine, as well as in the liver. Using human intestinal microsomes (HIM), we characterized the enteric enzymes that catalyze the initial O-demethylation of DB289 to the intermediate metabolite, M1. M1 formation in HIM was catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes, as evidenced by potent inhibition by 1-aminobenzotriazole and the requirement for NADPH. Apparent K(m) and V(max) values ranged from 0.6 to 2.4 microM and from 0.02 to 0.89 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively (n = 9). Of the P450 chemical inhibitors evaluated, ketoconazole was the most potent, inhibiting M1 formation by 66%. Two inhibitors of P450-mediated arachidonic acid metabolism, HET0016 (N-hydroxy-N'-(4-n-butyl-2-methylphenyl)formamidine) and 17-octadecynoic acid, inhibited M1 formation in a concentration-dependent manner (up to 95%). Immunoinhibition with an antibody raised against CYP4F2 showed concentration-dependent inhibition of M1 formation (up to 92%), whereas antibodies against CYP3A4/5 and CYP2J2 had negligible to modest effects. M1 formation rates correlated strongly with arachidonic acid omega-hydroxylation rates (r(2) = 0.94, P < 0.0001, n = 12) in a panel of HIM that lacked detectable CYP4A11 protein expression. Quantitative Western blot analysis revealed appreciable CYP4F expression in these HIM, with a mean (range) of 7 (3-18) pmol/mg protein. We conclude that enteric CYP4F enzymes could play a role in the first-pass biotransformation of DB289 and other xenobiotics.
17483343	A novel prodrug of the green tea polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate as a potential anticancer agent. The most abundant and biologically active green tea catechin, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate or (-)-EGCG, has been shown to act as a proteasome inhibitor and tumor cell death inducer. However, (-)-EGCG is unstable under physiologic conditions and has poor bioavailability. Previously, in an attempt to increase the stability of (-)-EGCG, we introduced peracetate protections to its reactive hydroxyl groups and showed that this peracetate-protected (-)-EGCG [Pro-EGCG (1); formerly named compound 1] could be converted into (-)-EGCG under cell-free conditions. In the current study, we provide evidence that when cultured human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with Pro-EGCG (1), (-)-EGCG was not only converted but also accumulated, accompanied by enhanced levels of proteasome inhibition, growth suppression, and apoptosis induction, compared with cells treated with natural (-)-EGCG. To investigate the potential use of Pro-EGCG (1) as a novel prodrug that converts to a cellular proteasome inhibitor and anticancer agent in vivo, MDA-MB-231 tumors were induced in nude mice, followed by treatment with Pro-EGCG (1) or (-)-EGCG for 31 days. Results of this in vivo study showed a significant inhibition of breast tumor growth by Pro-EGCG (1), compared with (-)-EGCG, associated with increased proteasome inhibition and apoptosis induction in tumor tissues. In conclusion, we have shown that Pro-EGCG (1) increases the bioavailability, stability, and proteasome-inhibitory and anticancer activities of (-)-EGCG in human breast cancer cells and tumors, suggesting its potential use for cancer prevention and treatment.
16510541	Metabolism and disposition of a potent and selective GABA-Aalpha2/3 receptor agonist in healthy male volunteers. [14C]7-(1,1-Dimethylethyl)-6-(2-ethyl-2H-1,2,4-triazol-3-ylmethoxy)-3-(2-fluorophenyl)-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-b]pyridazine ([14C]-TPA023; 99 microCi/dose) was administered to five young, healthy, fasted male subjects as a single oral dose (3.0 mg) in solution (propylene glycol/water, 10:90 v/v). The parent compound was rapidly absorbed (plasma Tmax approximately 2 h), exhibited an apparent terminal half-life of 6.7 h, and accounted for approximately 53% of the total radioactivity in plasma. After 7 days of collection, the mean total recovery of radioactivity in the excreta was 82.6%, with 53.2% and 29.4% in urine and feces, respectively. Radiochromatographic analysis of the excreta revealed that TPA023 was metabolized extensively, and only trace amounts of unchanged parent were recovered. Radiochromatograms of urine and feces showed that TPA023 underwent metabolism via three pathways (t-butyl hydroxylation, N-deethylation, and direct N-glucuronidation). The products of t-butyl hydroxylation and N-deethylation, together with their corresponding secondary metabolites, accounted for the majority of the radioactivity in the excreta. In addition, approximately 10.3% of the dose was recovered in urine as the triazolo-pyridazine N1-glucuronide of TPA023. The t-butyl hydroxy and N-desethyl metabolites of TPA023, the TPA023 N1-glucuronide, and the triazolo-pyridazine N1-glucuronide of N-desethyl TPA023 were present in plasma. In healthy male subjects, therefore, TPA023 is well absorbed and is metabolized extensively (t-butyl hydroxylation and N-deethylation > glucuronidation), and the metabolites are excreted in urine and feces.
21924249	The antibiotics roseoflavin and 8-demethyl-8-amino-riboflavin from Streptomyces davawensis are metabolized by human flavokinase and human FAD synthetase. The non-pathogenic Gram-positive soil bacterium Streptomyces davawensis synthesizes the riboflavin (vitamin B(2)) analogs roseoflavin (RoF) and 8-demethyl-8-amino-riboflavin (AF). Both compounds are antibiotics. Notably, a number of other riboflavin analogs are currently under investigation with regard to the development of novel antiinfectives. As a first step towards understanding the metabolism of riboflavin analogs in humans, the key enzymes flavokinase (EC 2.7.1.26) and FAD synthetase (EC 2.7.7.2) were studied. Human flavokinase efficiently converted RoF and AF to roseoflavin mononucleotide (RoFMN) and 8-demethyl-8-amino-riboflavin mononucleotide (AFMN), respectively. Human FAD synthetase accepted RoFMN but not AFMN as a substrate. Consequently, roseoflavin adenine dinucleotide (RoFAD) was synthesized by the latter enzyme but not 8-demethyl-8-amino-riboflavin adenine dinucleotide (AFAD). The cofactor analogs RoFMN, AFMN and RoFAD have different physicochemical properties as compared to FMN and FAD. Thus, the cofactor analogs have the potential to render flavoenzymes inactive, which may negatively affect human metabolism. RoF, but not AF, was found to inhibit human flavokinase. In summary, we suggest that AF has a lower toxic potential and may be better suited as a lead structure to develop antimicrobial compounds.
15733541	The metabolism of nonane, a JP-8 jet fuel component, by human liver microsomes, P450 isoforms and alcohol dehydrogenase and inhibition of human P450 isoforms by JP-8. Nonane, a component of jet-propulsion fuel 8 (JP-8), is metabolized to 2-nonanol and 2-nonanone by pooled human liver microsomes (pHLM). Cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 1A2, 2B6 and 2E1 metabolize nonane to 2-nonanol, whereas alcohol dehydrogenase, CYPs 2B6 and 2E1 metabolize 2-nonanol to 2-nonanone. Nonane and 2-nonanol showed no significant effect on the metabolism of testosterone, estradiol or N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), but did inhibit carbaryl metabolism. JP-8 showed modest inhibition of testosterone, estradiol and carbaryl metabolism, but had a more significant effect on the metabolism of DEET. JP-8 was shown to inhibit CYPs 1A2 and 2B6 mediated metabolism of DEET, suggesting that at least some of the components of JP-8 might be metabolized by CYPs 1A2and/or 2B6.
18095656	Metabolic activation of a novel 3-substituted indole-containing TNF-alpha inhibitor: dehydrogenation and inactivation of CYP3A4. SPD-304 is a recently discovered small-molecule TNF-alpha antagonist. However, SPD-304 contains a potentially toxic 3-alkylindole moiety. Previous studies on 3-methylindole and the 3-alkylindole-containing drugs zafirlukast and MK-0524 structural analogues found that they were bioactivated by cytochrome P450s through a dehydrogenation process to form 3-methyleneindolenine intermediates that are electrophilic alpha,beta-unsaturated iminium species. These electrophiles could react with protein and/or DNA nucleophilic residues to cause toxicities. In the present study, we found that SPD-304 was bioactivated through a similar dehydrogenation mechanism to produce a similar electrophilic 3-methyleneindolenine intermediate. The electrophile was trapped with nucleophilic glutathione and identified by LC/MS/MS. The iminium or another reactive intermediate also was a mechanism-based inactivator of CYP3A4. The inactivation parameters were K I = 29 microM and k inact = 0.047 min (-1). In addition, SPD-304 was metabolized through hydroxylation, N-dealkylation, and epoxidation pathways, and several metabolites and glutathione adducts were characterized by tandem mass spectrometry. The metabolism profile was also evaluated by in silico molecular docking of SPD-304 into the active site of CYP3A4, which predicted that the dehydrogenation reaction was initiated by 3-methylene C-H atom abstraction at the trifluoromethylphenyl-1 H-indol-3-ylmethyl portion of SPD-304. Hydroxylation of the 6'-methyl of the dimethylchromone portion of SPD-304 was the other major predicted metabolic pathway. The molecular models correlated precisely with experimental metabolic results. In summary, dehydrogenation of SPD-304 may cause toxicities through the formation of electrophilic intermediates and cause drug-drug interactions through CYP3A4 inactivation.
12469331	Dose dependent pharmacokinetics of albendazole in human. Pharmacokinetics of albendazole sulphoxide (ABZ-SO) in three different single oral doses of albendazole (ABZ) (400, 800 and 1200 mg) was studied in 10 healthy human volunteers in a double blind three-way crossover design. The serum levels of albendazole main metabolite, albendazole sulphoxide (ABZ-SO), were analysed by a modified high-pressure liquid chromatography method. (ABZ is not detectable in biological fluids itself.)For ABZ-SO, there was no significant difference in the biological half life, normalized serum peak concentration (C(max-ABZ-SO)/Dose(ABZ)), time to reach peak concentration (T(max)) and mean residence time (MRT), whereas apparent clearance (Cl(p)/F), apparent distribution volume (V(d)/F), normalized area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC(ABZ-SO)/Dose(ABZ)) and normalized area under the first moment curve (AUMC(ABZ-SO)/Dose(ABZ)) of albendazole main metabolite (ABZ-SO) were statistically different at different doses of the parent drug, resulting in substantially lower serum concentration and thereafter AUC(ABZ-SO)/Dose(ABZ) and AUMC(ABZ-SO)/Dose(ABZ) in higher doses. These observations indicate dose dependent pharmacokinetics of albendazole (observed for ABZ-SO), which were explained on the basis of a change in fraction of dose absorbed (F) as a result of slow and incomplete dissolution of the main drug in the GI tract.
12975333	In vitro metabolism studies on the isoxazole ring scission in the anti-inflammatory agent lefluonomide to its active alpha-cyanoenol metabolite A771726: mechanistic similarities with the cytochrome P450-catalyzed dehydration of aldoximes. The 3-unsubstituted isoxazole ring in the anti-inflammatory drug leflunomide undergoes a unique N-O bond cleavage to the active alpha-cyanoenol metabolite A771726, which resides in the same oxidation state as the parent. In vitro studies were conducted to characterize drug-metabolizing enzyme(s) responsible for ring opening and to gain insight into the mechanism of ring opening. Under physiological conditions, leflunomide was converted to A771726 in rat and human plasma (rat plasma,t1/2 = 36 min; human plasma, t1/2 = 12 min) and whole blood (rat blood, t1/2 = 59 min; human blood, t1/2 = 43 min). Human serum albumin also catalyzed A771726 formation, albeit at a much slower rate (t1/2 = 110 min). Rat and human liver microsomes also demonstrated NADPH-dependent A771726 formation (human liver microsomes, Vmax = 1797 pmol/min/mg and Km = 274 microM). Leflunomide metabolism in microsomes was sensitive to furafylline treatment, suggesting p4501A2 involvement. 3-Methylleflunomide, which contained a 3-methyl substituent on the isoxazole ring, was resistant to ring opening in base, plasma, blood, and liver microsomes. In microsomes, two monohydroxylated metabolites were formed, and metabolite identification studies established the 3- and the 5-methyl groups on the isoxazole ring as sites of hydroxylation. These results indicate that the C3-H in leflunomide is essential for ring opening. Although A771726 formation in human liver microsomes or recombinant p4501A2 required NADPH, its formation was greatly reduced by oxygen or carbon monoxide, suggesting that the isoxazole ring opening was catalyzed by the p450Fe(II) form of the enzyme. A mechanism for the p450-mediated ring scission is proposed in which the isoxazole ring nitrogen or oxygen coordinates to the reduced form of the heme followed by charge transfer from p450Fe(II) to the C=N bond or deprotonation of the C3-H, which results in a cleavage of the N-O bond.
19725579	Phosphoramidate prodrugs of 2'-C-methylcytidine for therapy of hepatitis C virus infection. The application of a phosphoramidate prodrug approach to 2'-C-methylcytidine (NM107), the first nucleoside inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B polymerase, is reported. 2'-C-Methylcytidine, as its valyl ester prodrug (NM283), was efficacious in reducing the viral load in patients infected with HCV. Several of the phosphoramidates prepared demonstrated a 10- to 200-fold superior potency with respect to the parent nucleoside in the cell-based replicon assay. This is due to higher levels of 2'-C-methylcytidine triphosphate in the cells. These prodrugs are efficiently activated and converted to the triphosphate in hepatocytes of several species. Our SAR studies ultimately led to compounds that gave high levels of NTP in hamster and rat liver after subcutaneous dosing and that were devoid of the toxic phenol moiety usually found in ProTides.
15833027	In vitro bioactivation of dihydrobenzoxathiin selective estrogen receptor modulators by cytochrome P450 3A4 in human liver microsomes: formation of reactive iminium and quinone type metabolites. Estrogens and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are prescribed widely in the clinic to alleviate symptoms in postmenopausal women, and they are metabolized to reactive intermediates, which may elicit adverse effects. As part of our efforts to develop safer SERMs, in vitro covalent protein binding of (2S,3R)-(+)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-[4-(2-piperidin-1-ylethoxy)phenyl]-2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzoxathiin-6-ol (I) was evaluated. Radioactivity from [3H]I became covalently bound to proteins in a fashion that was both time- and NADPH-dependent in human liver microsomes and reached a value of 1106 pmol equiv/mg protein following a 45 min incubation. At least three pathways are involved in the bioactivation of I, namely, oxidative cleavage of the dihydrobenzoxathiin moiety to give a hydroquinone/para-benzoquinone redox couple, hydroxylation at position 5 or 7 of the benzoxathiin moiety leading to an o-quinone intermediate, and metabolism of the piperidine ring to give an iminium ion. The latter reactive intermediate was identified as its bis-cyano adduct when human liver microsomal incubations were performed in the presence of sodium cyanide. Structural modification of I, including a replacement of the piperidine with a pyrrolidine group, led to (2S,3R)-(+)-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-2-[4-(2-pyrrolidin-1-ylethoxy)phenyl]-2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzoxathiin-6-ol (II), which did not form a reactive iminium ion. Following the incubation of II with human liver microsomes, covalent binding to proteins was reduced (461 pmol equiv/mg protein), the residual level of binding apparently due to the formation of a rearranged biphenyl quinone type metabolite. Studies with inhibitory antibodies and chemical inhibitors showed that P450 3A4 was the primary enzyme responsible for oxidative bioactivation of I and II in human liver microsomes. These studies thus demonstrated that gaining an understanding of bioactivation mechanisms may be exploited in terms of guiding structural modifications of drug candidates to minimize covalent protein binding and, hopefully, to lower the potential for drug-mediated adverse effects.
15962227	Efficacy of DB289 in Thai patients with Plasmodium vivax or acute, uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum infections. DB289 is the orally active prodrug of the diamidine DB75, which was developed for the treatment of human African trypanosomiasis. We tested the safety and efficacy of DB289 for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax and acute, uncomplicated P. falciparum infections in an open-label pilot study at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Bangkok. Nine patients with P. vivax infections and 23 patients with P. falciparum infections were admitted and treated with 100 mg of DB289 given orally twice a day for 5 days and were followed for 28 days. Patients with P. vivax infections were also treated with primaquine on days 10-23. All patients cleared parasites by day 7, with a mean+/-SD clearance time of 43+/-41 h. One patient with a P. vivax infection had a recurrence of parasitemia on day 9. Of the 23 patients with P. falciparum infections, 3 had recurrences of parasitemia caused by P. vivax and 2 had recurrences of parasitemia caused by P. falciparum. In only 1 of 2 recurrences of parasitemia caused by P. falciparum were the parasites genotypically distinct from the infecting parasites the patient had at enrollment, which means there was a 96% cure rate. DB289 is a promising new antimalarial compound that could become an important component of new antimalarial combinations.
22752007	Comparison of metabolism of sesamin and episesamin by drug-metabolizing enzymes in human liver. Sesamin and episesamin are two epimeric lignans that are found in refined sesame oil. Commercially available sesamin supplements contain both sesamin and episesamin at an approximate 1:1 ratio. Our previous study clarified the sequential metabolism of sesamin by cytochrome P450 (P450) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase in human liver. In addition, we revealed that sesamin caused a mechanism-based inhibition (MBI) of CYP2C9, the P450 enzyme responsible for sesamin monocatecholization. In the present study, we compared the metabolism and the MBI of episesamin with those of sesamin. Episesamin was first metabolized to the two epimers of monocatechol, S- and R-monocatechols in human liver microsomes. The P450 enzymes responsible for S- and R-monocatechol formation were CYP2C9 and CYP1A2, respectively. The contribution of CYP2C9 was much larger than that of CYP1A2 in sesamin metabolism, whereas the contribution of CYP2C9 was almost equal to that of CYP1A2 in episesamin metabolism. Docking of episesamin to the active site of CYP1A2 explained the stereoselectivity in CYP1A2-dependent episesamin monocatecholization. Similar to sesamin, the episesamin S- and R-monocatechols were further metabolized to dicatechol, glucuronide, and methylate metabolites in human liver; however, the contribution of each reaction was significantly different between sesamin and episesamin. The liver microsomes from CYP2C19 ultra-rapid metabolizers showed a significant amount of episesamin dicatechol. In this study, we have revealed significantly different metabolism by P450, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, and catechol-O-methyltransferase for sesamin and episesamin, resulting in different biological effects.
23439661	Disposition and metabolism of GSK2251052 in humans: a novel boron-containing antibiotic. (S)-3-(Aminomethyl)-7-(3-hydroxypropoxy)-1-hydroxy-1,3-dihydro-2,1-benzoxaborole (GSK2251052) is a novel boron-containing antibiotic that inhibits bacterial leucyl tRNA synthetase, and that has been in development for the treatment of serious Gram-negative infections. In this study, six healthy adult male subjects received a single i.v. dose of [¹⁴C]GSK2251052, 1500 mg infused over 1 hour. Blood, urine, and feces were collected over an extended period of 14 days, and accelerator mass spectrometry was used to quantify low levels of radioactivity in plasma at later time points to supplement the less-sensitive liquid scintillation counting technique. An excellent mass balance recovery was achieved representing a mean total of 98.2% of the dose, including 90.5% recovered in the urine. Pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that radioactivity was moderately associated with the blood cellular components, and together with GSK2251052, both were highly distributed into tissues. The parent compound had a much shorter half-life than total radioactivity in plasma, approximately 11.6 hours compared with 96 hours. GSK2251052 and its major metabolite M3, which resulted from oxidation of the propanol side chain to the corresponding carboxylic acid, comprised the majority of the plasma radioactivity, 37 and 53% of the area under the plasma versus time concentration curve from time zero to infinity, respectively. Additionally, M3 was eliminated renally, and was demonstrated to be responsible for the long plasma radioactivity elimination half-life. A combination of in vitro metabolism experiments and a pharmacokinetic study in monkeys with the inhibitor 4-methylpyrazole provided strong evidence that alcohol dehydrogenase, potentially in association with aldehyde dehydrogenase, is the primary enzyme involved in the formation of the M3 metabolite.
14503661	Pharmacokinetics of a novel N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist (SM-18400): identification of an N-acetylated metabolite and pre-clinical assessment of N-acetylation polymorphism. (S)-9-chloro-5-[p-aminomethyl-o-(carboxymethoxy)phenylcarbamoylmethyl]-6,7-dihydro-1 H,5 H-pyrido[1,2,3-de]quinoxaline-2,3-dione hydrochloride trihydrate (SM-18400) was given intravenously to rats and dogs and its pharmacokinetics was investigated. By LC/MS/MS analysis, the major metabolite in the rat serum was identified as N-acetylated SM-18400 (SM-NAc). In rats, AUC ratio of SM-NAc to SM-18400 was approximately 50%. However, 71% of the dose was excreted as unchanged SM-18400 and only 9.8% as SM-NAc in the urine and bile, indicating that the contribution of N-acetylation clearance (CL(NAc)) to the total clearance (CL(tot)) is limited to 10-30% in rats. No SM-NAc or other metabolites were detected in the dog serum, urine or bile. The in vitro intrinsic clearance (CL(int), ml/min/mg cytosolic protein) of N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activities of dog liver cytosol towards SM-18400 and hepatic N-acetylation clearance (CL(NAc), ml/min/kg body weight) estimated by well-stirred model were both only 5% of the respective rat value, well reflecting the relative in vivo CL(NAc)/CL(tot) ratios. CL(int) values for human liver cytosol samples (n = 4) and estimated CL(NAc) were all less than 18% and 7% of the rat, respectively. Based on these results, we concluded that the CL(NAc)/CL(tot) of human would be small enough to avoid major inter-individual variance in SM-18400 pharmacokinetics due to N-acetylation polymorphism. In addition, even a human liver cytosol sample lacking polymorphic NAT2 activity as determined by sulfamethazine (SMZ) N-acetylation analysis, proved capable of acetylating SM-18400, suggesting that NAT2 is not the major enzyme responsible for N-acetylation of SM-18400 in human. This fact would also reduce the risk of N-acetylation polymorphism playing a role in clinical use of this drug.
15523046	Bioactivation of the nontricyclic antidepressant nefazodone to a reactive quinone-imine species in human liver microsomes and recombinant cytochrome P450 3A4. The therapeutic benefits of the antidepressant nefazodone have been hampered by several cases of acute hepatotoxicity/liver failure. Although the mechanism of hepatotoxicity remains unknown, it is possible that reactive metabolites of nefazodone play a causative role. Studies were initiated to determine whether nefazodone undergoes bioactivation in human liver microsomes to electrophilic intermediates. Following incubation of nefazodone with microsomes or recombinant P4503A4 in the presence of sulfydryl nucleophiles, conjugates derived from the addition of thiol to a monohydroxylated nefazodone metabolite were observed. Product ion spectra suggested that hydroxylation and sulfydryl conjugation occurred on the 3-chlorophenylpiperazine-ring, consistent with a bioactivation pathway involving initial formation of p-hydroxynefazodone, followed by its two-electron oxidation to the reactive quinone-imine intermediate. The formation of novel N-dearylated nefazodone metabolites was also discernible in these incubations, and 2-chloro-1,4-benzoquinone, a by-product of N-dearylation, was trapped with glutathione to afford the corresponding hydroquinone-sulfydryl adduct. Nefazodone also displayed NADPH-, time-, and concentration-dependent inactivation of P4503A4 activity, suggesting that reactive metabolites derived from nefazodone bioactivation are capable of covalently modifying P4503A4. A causative role for 2-chloro-1,4-benzoquinone and/or the quinone-imine intermediate(s) in nefazodone hepatotoxicity is speculated. Although the antianxiety agent buspirone, which contains a pyrimidine ring in place of the 3-chlorophenyl-ring, also generated p-hydroxybuspirone in liver microsomes, no sulfydryl conjugates of this metabolite were observed. This finding is consistent with the proposal that two-electron oxidation of p-hydroxybuspirone to the corresponding quinone-imine is less favorable due to differences in the protonation state at physiological pH and due to weaker resonance stabilization of the oxidation products as predicted from ab initio measurements.
22031623	Identification of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases responsible for the glucuronidation of darexaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor, in human liver and intestine. Darexaban maleate is a novel oral direct factor Xa inhibitor, which is under development for the prevention of venous thromboembolism. Darexaban glucuronide was the major component in plasma after oral administration of darexaban to humans and is the pharmacologically active metabolite. In this study, we identified UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) responsible for darexaban glucuronidation in human liver microsomes (HLM) and human intestinal microsomes (HIM). In HLM, the K(m) value for darexaban glucuronidation was >250 μM. In HIM, the reaction followed substrate inhibition kinetics, with a K(m) value of 27.3 μM. Among recombinant human UGTs, UGT1A9 showed the highest intrinsic clearance for darexaban glucuronidation, followed by UGT1A8, -1A10, and -1A7. All other UGT isoforms were inactive toward darexaban. The K(m) value of recombinant UGT1A10 for darexaban glucuronidation (34.2 μM) was comparable to that of HIM. Inhibition studies using typical UGT substrates suggested that darexaban glucuronidation in both HLM and HIM was mainly catalyzed by UGT1A8, -1A9, and -1A10. Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (2%) decreased the unbound K(m) for darexaban glucuronidation from 216 to 17.6 μM in HLM and from 35.5 to 18.3 μM in recombinant UGT1A9. Recent studies indicated that the mRNA expression level of UGT1A9 is extremely high among UGT1A7, -1A8, -1A9, and -1A10 in human liver, whereas that of UGT1A10 is highest in the intestine. Thus, the present results strongly suggest that darexaban glucuronidation is mainly catalyzed by UGT1A9 and UGT1A10 in human liver and intestine, respectively. In addition, UGT1A7, -1A8, and -1A9 play a minor role in human intestine.
22245954	The effect of aprepitant and race on the pharmacokinetics of cyclophosphamide in breast cancer patients. The prodrug cyclophosphamide is metabolized by cytochrome P450(CYP)2B6 to the active metabolite, 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide (4-OH), and by CYP3A4/5 to toxic chloracetaldehyde and 2-dechloroethylcyclophosphamide (DCE). Since aprepitant is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4, the study was designed to determine whether its concurrent use alters the pharmacokinetics (PK) of cyclophosphamide. In addition, we sought to determine the effect of race and pharmacogenomics on cyclophosphamide PK. Eighteen patients with localized breast cancer were randomized in this double-blinded cross-over study to receive aprepitant or placebo in addition to cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) and doxorubicin 60 mg/m(2). Blood samples were collected for both PK analysis of cyclophosphamide and metabolites and pharmacogenomic analysis. Single nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped were CYP3A4*1B, CYP3A5*3, and CYP2B6*6. The geometric mean area under concentration-time curve (AUC(0-t) μg/mL h) for cyclophosphamide was 282 following aprepitant and 230 following placebo (ratio 1.23; 90% CI 1.13, 1.33). 4-OH AUC(0-t) (μg/mL h) was 6.80 following aprepitant and 6.96 following placebo (ratio 0.98; 90% CI 0.88, 1.08). DCE AUC(0-t) (μg/mL h) was 6.76 following aprepitant and 9.37 following placebo (ratio 0.72; 90% CI 0.64, 0.81). Genotype analysis was confounded by race. Race was a significant predictor of DCE lnAUC(0-t) (P = 0.0169) as African Americans had approximately a 2-fold higher DCE AUC than Caucasians. Aprepitant altered the exposure of cyclophosphamide and DCE but not the active 4-OH metabolite, making it unlikely that aprepitant would change the clinical efficacy of cyclophosphamide. African Americans were also found to have altered PK compared with Caucasian patients.
18197557	Metabolism of OR-1896, a metabolite of levosimendan, in rats and humans. OR-1896 is a pharmacologically active, long-lived metabolite of levosimendan. In the current study, the metabolism of (14)C-labelled OR-1896 was investigated in six healthy men after intravenous infusion over 10 min and in male rats after an intravenous bolus dose. In human plasma, the only (14)C-compounds detected were (14)C-OR-1896 and its deacetylated form, (14)C-OR-1855, in varying proportions in different subjects. In rat plasma >93% of radioactivity was associated with OR-1896. Radioactivity was mainly excreted to urine in both rats (about 69% of the dose) and humans (about 87% of the dose). OR-1896 was a major urinary compound in both humans and rats. Another major human metabolite was hypothesized as N-conjugated OR-1855. Other human and rat urinary biotransformation products were characterized as N-hydroxylated OR-1896 and N-hydroxylated OR-1855, as well as glucuronide or sulphate conjugates of N-hydroxyl OR-1896. The main difference between rat and human metabolism was a lower amount of OR-1855-related metabolites in the rats. In human faecal homogenates, only OR-1896 and OR-1855 were detected, whereas rat faecal metabolite profile was similar to that in urine.
17220241	Disposition of the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor sitagliptin in rats and dogs. The pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and excretion of sitagliptin [MK-0431; (2R)-4-oxo-4-[3-(trifluoromethyl)-5,6-dihydro[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]pyrazin-7(8H)-yl]-1-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)butan-2-amine], a potent dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor, were evaluated in male Sprague-Dawley rats and beagle dogs. The plasma clearance and volume of distribution of sitagliptin were higher in rats (40-48 ml/min/kg, 7-9 l/kg) than in dogs ( approximately 9 ml/min/kg, approximately 3 l/kg), and its half-life was shorter in rats, approximately 2 h compared with approximately 4 h in dogs. Sitagliptin was absorbed rapidly after oral administration of a solution of the phosphate salt. The absolute oral bioavailability was high, and the pharmacokinetics were fairly dose-proportional. After administration of [(14)C]sitagliptin, parent drug was the major radioactive component in rat and dog plasma, urine, bile, and feces. Sitagliptin was eliminated primarily by renal excretion of parent drug; biliary excretion was an important pathway in rats, whereas metabolism was minimal in both species in vitro and in vivo. Approximately 10 to 16% of the radiolabeled dose was recovered in the rat and dog excreta as phase I and II metabolites, which were formed by N-sulfation, N-carbamoyl glucuronidation, hydroxylation of the triazolopiperazine ring, and oxidative desaturation of the piperazine ring followed by cyclization via the primary amine. The renal clearance of unbound drug in rats, 32 to 39 ml/min/kg, far exceeded the glomerular filtration rate, indicative of active renal elimination of parent drug.
22429462	In vitro bioactivation of bazedoxifene and 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-methyl-1H-indol-5-ol in human liver microsomes. Bazedoxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that has been developed for use in post-menopausal osteoporosis. However, it contains a potentially toxic 5-hydroxy-3-methylindole moiety. Previous studies on the 5-hydroxyindole and the 3-alkylindole-containing drugs indometacine, zafirlukast and MK-0524 structural analogs have shown that they are bioactivated by cytochrome P450s through a dehydrogenation process to form quinoneimine or 3-methyleneindolenine electrophilic species. In the present study, bazedoxifene was synthesized and then evaluated, together with raloxifene and 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-methyl-1H-indol-5-ol (13), a 3-methyl-5-hydroxyindole-based structural fragment of bazedoxifene, for its ability to form reactive electrophilic species when incubated with human liver microsomes (HLMs) or recombinant CYP isozymes. We showed that bazedoxifene was bioactivated only in trace amounts with recombinant CYP isozymes. In contrast, the N-dealkylated fragment of bazedoxifene (2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-methyl-1H-indol-5-ol) was bioactivated in considerable amounts to an electrophilic intermediate, which was trapped with glutathione and identified by LC-MS/MS. This suggests that bazedoxifene would require initial N-dealkylation, which could subsequently lead to the formation of the reactive intermediate. However, such an N-dealkylated metabolite of bazedoxifene was not detected after the incubation of bazedoxifene in HLM or recombinant CYP isozymes.
15895233	Metabolic profile of XK469 (2(R)-[4-(7-chloro-2-quinoxalinyl)oxyphenoxy]-propionic acid; NSC698215) in patients and in vitro: low potential for active or toxic metabolites or for drug-drug interactions. As part of an ongoing phase 1 study, we studied the excretion of XK469 and its metabolism in patients and in vitro. Five primary metabolites were identified by HPLC/MS/MS. An oxidized product formed by cytosolic aldehyde oxidase was the predominant species both in urine and human hepatocytes in vitro. Conjugates of XK469 with glycine, taurine, and glucuronic acid, as well as the microsomal product, 4-oxo-XK469, were also found in urine and in vitro, but none were major contributors to the mass balance for XK469 elimination. Based upon the relative concentrations circulating in plasma, systemic exposure to parent drug was 100-fold higher than for the metabolites. Thus, both toxicity and efficacy of XK469 are most likely to be produced by the parent molecule, rather than the metabolites. Urinary recovery of parent drug was low (2% of dose in 24 h), partly because of the long half-life of XK469 (approximately 3 days). In addition, the metabolite profile in urine indicates that only 25% of the XK469-derived material was unchanged drug. Thus, urinary excretion was not a major factor in XK469 elimination. Variations in systemic exposure to XK469 will be strongly influenced by factors that alter the activity of aldehyde oxidase, including pharmacogenetics, enzyme inhibition, and enzyme induction, but no specific modifiers have been reported. The multiday half-life of XK469 hampered our ability to obtain a complete mass balance, and the possibility exists that other routes, such as biliary excretion, may also play a substantial role in XK469 disposition.
12018995	Biotransformation of 1,1,1,3,3-Pentafluoropropane (HFC-245fa). 1,1,1,3,3-Pentafluoropropane (HFC-245fa) is being developed as a CFC substitute. 1,1,1,3,3-Pentafluoropropane has a low potential for toxicity: the only remarkable toxic effect seen in rats after inhalation exposure to 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane in concentrations of up to 50,000 ppm for 90 days was an increased incidence of diffuse myocarditis. To elucidate the possible role of biotransformation in 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane-induced cardiotoxicity, the biotransformation of 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane was investigated in rats after inhalation exposure and in rat and human liver microsomes. Male and female rats were exposed by inhalation to 50 000, 10 000, and 2000 ppm 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane for 6 h, urine was collected for 72 h, and metabolites excreted were identified by 19F NMR spectroscopy and quantified by GC/MS. Trifluoroacetic acid and inorganic fluoride were identified as major urinary metabolites of 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane; 3,3,3-trifluoropropanoic acid and 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane-2-ol were minor metabolites. The extent of 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane biotransformation after inhalation was dependent on exposure concentrations. Neither 3,3,3-trifluoropropanoic acid nor 3,3,3-trifluoropyruvic acid were metabolized to trifluoroacetic acid in vitro or in rats. In rat and human liver microsomes, 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane was biotransformed by a cytochrome P450-dependent reaction to trifluoroacetic acid and 3,3,3-trifluoropropanoic acid. Rates of trifluoroacetic acid formation were 99.2 +/- 20.5 pmol (mg of protein)(-)(1) min(-)(1) and of 3,3,3-trifluoropropanoic acid formation were 17.5 +/- 4.0 pmol (mg of protein)(-)(1) min(-)(1) in liver microsomes from male rats. In human liver microsomes, rates of trifluoroacetic acid formation ranged from 0 to 11.6 pmol (mg of protein)(-)(1) min(-)(1), and rates of 3,3,3-trifluoropropanoic acid formation ranged from 0.7 to 7.6 pmol (mg of protein)(-)(1) min(-)(1). The results show that 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane is metabolized at low rates in vivo and in vitro. The toxic effects of 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane may be associated with the formation of the minor metabolite 3,3,3-trifluoropropanoic acid, which is highly toxic in rats.
18549292	Protein adduct formation by glucuronide metabolites of permethrin. Biomonitoring of exposure to the insecticide permethrin is usually performed by analysis of its urinary metabolites 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA) or cis/ trans-3-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (Cl 2 CA). We are engaged in the development of a methodology to assess the cumulative internal dose of exposure to permethrin, which is based on the assumption that (reactive) glucuronide conjugates of the major permethrin metabolites 3-PBA and Cl 2 CA will form persistent (weeks to months) adducts to proteins, in analogy with the glucuronide conjugates of structurally related drugs. The 3-PBA and Cl 2 CA beta-glucuronide metabolites of permethrin have been successfully chemically and enzymatically synthesized. Their identities have been assessed by means of (1)H NMR spectroscopy and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The reactivity of these metabolites with various amino acids, peptides, and albumin in human plasma has been studied. Several distinct adducts could be identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. After pronase digestion of albumin isolated from exposed human plasma, various lysine derivatives resulted with favorable mass spectrometric and chromatographic properties. Covalent binding was quantified by using [(14)C]-3-PBA glucuronide; >1.5% of total radioactivity was bound to proteins. It is envisaged that the obtained results can form a firm basis for the development of a protein adduct-based methodology for biomonitoring exposure to permethrin. In view of the widespread use of permethrin, the toxicological relevance of protein binding by its metabolites will be addressed in more detail in future work.
16381667	Glucuronidation as a major metabolic clearance pathway of 14c-labeled muraglitazar in humans: metabolic profiles in subjects with or without bile collection. The metabolism and disposition of 14C-labeled muraglitazar (Pargluva), a novel dual alpha/gamma peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor activator, was investigated in eight healthy male subjects with and without bile collection (groups 1 and 2) after a single 20-mg oral dose. Bile samples were collected for 3 to 8 h after dosing from group 2 subjects in addition to the urine and feces collection. In plasma, the parent compound was the major component, and circulating metabolites, including several glucuronide conjugates, were minor components at all time points. The exposure to parent drug (Cmax and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve) in subjects with bile collection was generally lower than that in subjects without bile collection. The major portion of the radioactive dose was recovered in feces (91% for group 1 and 51% for group 2). In addition, 40% of the dose was recovered in the bile from group 2 subjects. In this 3- to 8-h bile, the glucuronide of muraglitazar (M13, 15% of dose) and the glucuronides of its oxidative metabolites (M17a,b,c, M18a,b,c, and M20, together, 16% of dose) accounted for approximately 80% of the biliary radioactivity; muraglitazar and its O-demethylated metabolite (M15) each accounted for approximately 4% of the dose. In contrast, fecal samples only contained muraglitazar and its oxidative metabolites, suggesting hydrolysis of biliary glucuronides in the intestine before fecal excretion. Thus, the subjects with and without bile collection showed different metabolic profiles of muraglitazar after oral administration, and glucuronidation was not observed as a major pathway of metabolic clearance from subjects with the conventional urine and fecal collection, but was found as a major elimination pathway from subjects with bile collection.
21444712	Pharmacokinetics and safety of FV-100, a novel oral anti-herpes zoster nucleoside analogue, administered in single and multiple doses to healthy young adult and elderly adult volunteers. FV-100 is the prodrug of the highly potent anti-varicella zoster virus bicyclic nucleoside analogue CF-1743. To characterize the pharmacokinetics and safety of oral FV-100, 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials were conducted: (i) a single-ascending-dose study in 32 healthy subjects aged 18 to 55 years (100-, 200-, 400-, and 800-mg doses) with an evaluation of the food effect in the 400-mg group; (ii) a multiple-ascending-dose study in 48 subjects aged 18 to 55 years (100 mg once daily [QD], 200 mg QD, 400 mg QD, 400 mg twice a day, and 800 mg QD for 7 days); and (iii) a 2-part study in subjects aged 65 years and older with a single 400-mg dose in 15 subjects and a 400-mg QD dosing regimen for 7 days in 12 subjects. FV-100 was rapidly and extensively converted to CF-1743, the concentration of which remained above that required to reduce viral activity by 50% for the 24-hour dosing period. Renal excretion of CF-1743 was very low. A high-fat meal reduced exposure to CF-1743; a low-fat meal did not. Pharmacokinetic parameters for the elderly subjects were comparable to those for the younger subjects. FV-100 was well tolerated by all subjects. The pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of FV-100 support its continued investigation for the treatment of herpes zoster and prevention of postherpetic neuralgia with once-daily dosing and without dose modifications for elderly or renally impaired patients.
12386137	Structure and stereochemistry of the active metabolite of clopidogrel. Clopidogrel (SR25990C, PLAVIX) is a potent antiplatelet drug, which has been recently launched and is indicated for the prevention of vascular thrombotic events in patients at risk. Clopidogrel is inactive in vitro, and a hepatic biotransformation is necessary to express the full antiaggregating activity of the drug. Moreover, 2-oxo-clopidogrel has been previously suggested to be the essential key intermediate metabolite from which the active metabolite is formed. In the present paper, we give the evidence of the occurrence of an in vitro active metabolite after incubation of 2-oxo-clopidogrel with human liver microsomes. This metabolite was purified by liquid chromatography, and its structure was studied by a combination of mass spectometry (MS) and NMR experiments. MS results suggested that the active metabolite belongs to a family of eight stereoisomers with the following primary chemical structure: 2-[1-[1-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-methoxy-2-oxoethyl]-4-sulfanyl-3-piperidinylidene]acetic acid. Chiral supercritical fluid chromatography resolved these isomers. However, only one of the eight metabolites retained the biological activity, thus underlining the critical importance of associated absolute configuration. Because of its highly labile character, probably due to a very reactive thiol function, structural elucidation of the active metabolite was performed on the stabilized acrylonitrile derivative. Conjunction of all our results suggested that the active metabolite is of S configuration at C 7 and Z configuration at C 3-C 16 double bound.
12409737	Metabolic activation of nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors in dendritic and Langerhans cells. Langerhans cells and interstitial dendritic cells are the earliest targets for HIV infection through sexual transmission of HIV. Metabolism of nucleoside analogues markedly differs in proliferating T lymphocytes and resting monocyte/macrophages, and thus their antiviral efficacy can substantially differ between both cell types. The metabolism of radio-labelled zidovudine (ZDV), lamivudine (3TC) and tenofovir (PMPA) to their antivirally active metabolites was studied in primary cells, representative of early in vivo targets of HIV [i.e. monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MO-DC), MO-derived Langerhans cells (MO-LC), PHA/IL-2-activated T-blast cells] as well as in a laboratory T-lymphocyte (CEM) cell line. Whereas lamivudine metabolism to its active triphosphate derivative (3TC-TP) did not markedly differ between T-cells and MO-derived LC and DC, zidovudine was much better converted to ZDV-TP in T-cells than in MO-LC and MO-DC. In contrast, tenofovir was markedly more abundantly converted to its antivirally active diphosphate metabolite PMPApp in MO-DC and MO-LC than zidovudine and lamivudine. Our metabolic data suggest that tenofovir may be superior to zidovudine and lamivudine for inhibition of HIV replication in dendritic/Langerhans cells, the first-line cell types targeted by a primary HIV infection.
20564607	A rapid and most sensitive liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method for simultaneous determination of alverine and its major metabolite, para hydroxy alverine, in human plasma: application to a pharmacokinetic and bioequivalence study. A rapid and highly sensitive method for the determination of alverine (ALV) and its metabolite, para hydroxy alverine (PHA), in human plasma using LC-MS/MS in positive ion electrospray ionization (ESI) in multiple reactions monitoring (MRM) mode was developed and validated. The procedure involves a simple solid phase extraction (SPE). Chromatographic separation was carried out on a Hypersil GOLD C(18) column (50 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 microm) with an isocratic mobile phase and a total run time of 1.5 min. The standard calibration curves showed excellent linearity within the range of 0.060-10.051 ng/mL for ALV and 0.059-10.017 ng/mL for PHA (r > or = 0.990). This method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study after oral administration of alverine citrate 120 mg capsule in Indian healthy male volunteers.
14765546	LC-MS-MS analysis of 2-pyridylacetic acid, a major metabolite of betahistine: application to a pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers. 1. A sensitive liquid chromatographic-tandem mas spectrometric assay was developed and validated to determine the major metabolite of betahistine, 2-pyridylacetic acid, in human plasma. 2. The analyte was extracted from plasma samples by liquid-liquid extraction and analysed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with an electrospray ionization interface. The method has a lower limit of quantitation of 1 ng ml(-1) fir a 0.5-ml plasma aliquot. The intra- and interday precision (relative standard deviation), calculated from quality control (QC) samples, was less than 10%. Accuracy as determined from QC samples was within +/-7%. 3. The validated method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study of betahistine in healthy volunteers. After oral administration of a single dose of 24 mg betahistine mesylate to 20 healthy Chinese male volunteers, Cmax was 339.4 ng ml(-1) (range 77.3-776.4 ng ml(-1)). The t(1/2) was 5.2 h (range 2.0(-1)-11.4h). The AUC(0-t) obtained was 1153.5 ng ml(-1) h (range 278.5-3150.8 ng ml(-1)). The disposition of the metabolite exhibited a marked interindividual variation. 4. The plasma concentrations of the parent drug were less than 0.5 ng ml(-1), suggesting that it undergoes almost complete first-pass metabolism. The reported two active metabolites were not detected in the plasma of any volunteer. Although there is no evidence that the major metabolite has pharmacological activity, the clinical importance of 2-pyridylacetic acid in humans should be reinvestigated.
18333867	Assessment of the absorption, metabolism and absolute bioavailability of maraviroc in healthy male subjects. Two studies were conducted to: (i) quantify the amount of drug-related radioactivity in blood, plasma, urine and faeces following a (14)C-labelled dose of maraviroc; and (ii) investigate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of intravenous (i.v.) maraviroc and determine the absolute bioavailability of oral maraviroc. Metabolite profiling was also conducted. Data from both of these studies were used to construct a mass-balance model for maraviroc. Study 1 was an open-label study in three healthy male subjects. All subjects received a single 300-mg oral solution dose of (14)C-labelled maraviroc. Study 2 included two cohorts of subjects. Cohort 1 involved a double-blind (third party open), four-way crossover study where eight subjects received escalating i.v. doses of maraviroc (3, 10 and 30 mg) with placebo insertion. Cohort 2 involved an open, two-way crossover study where 12 subjects received 30 mg maraviroc by i.v. infusion and 100 mg maraviroc orally in random order. In study 1, blood samples and all urine and faeces were collected up to at least 120 h postdose. In study 2, blood samples were taken at intervals up to 48 h postdose. Urine was also collected up to 24 h postdose in cohort 1 only. After oral administration in study 1, maraviroc was rapidly absorbed with a plasma T(max) reached by 2 h postdose for all three subjects. The maximum concentrations of radioactivity also occurred within 2 h for all subjects. There was a higher amount of radioactivity in plasma than in blood (blood/plasma ratio approximately 0.6 for AUC(t) and C(max)). Unchanged maraviroc was the major circulating component in plasma, accounting for approximately 42% of the circulating radioactivity. Following a 300-mg (14)C-labelled maraviroc dose, means of 76.4% and 19.6% of radioactivity were recovered in the faeces and urine, respectively. The mean total recovery of dosed radioactivity was 96%, with the majority of radioactivity being recovered within 96 h postdose. Profiling of the urine and faeces showed similar and extensive metabolism in all subjects. Unchanged maraviroc was the major excreted component (33%). The major metabolic pathways were determined and involved oxidation and N-dealkylation. Intravenous doses of maraviroc (3-30 mg) were well tolerated in study 2, and drug exposure was approximately proportional to dose within the studied range. Approximately 23% of total clearance (44 l h(-1)) was accounted for by renal clearance (10.2 l h(-1)). Mean volume of distribution at steady state was 194 l. Absolute bioavailability of a 100-mg oral tablet dose, by comparison with a 30-mg i.v. dose, was calculated to be 23.1%. Maraviroc is rapidly absorbed and extensively metabolized, although unchanged maraviroc is the major circulating component in plasma and is the major excreted component after oral dosing. The pharmacokinetics of maraviroc after i.v. administration is approximately proportional over the dose range studied. Renal clearance contributes 23% of total clearance. The absolute bioavailability of 100 mg oral maraviroc is 23%.
11133658	Thymidine kinase-independent intracellular delivery of bioactive nucleotides by aryl phosphate derivatives of bromo-methoxy zidovudine (compounds WHI-05 and WHI-07) in normal human female genital tract epithelial cells and sperm. The compounds WHI-05 (5-bromo-6-methoxy-5, 6-dihydro-3'-azidothymidine-5'-[p-methoxyphenyl] methoxyalaninyl phosphate) and WHI-07 (5-bromo-6-methoxy-5, 6-dihydro-3'-azidothymidine-5'-[p-bromophenyl] methoxyalaninyl phosphate) are aryl phosphate derivatives of zidovudine (ZDV) with dual-function anti-human immunodeficiency virus and contraceptive activity. These drugs were rationally designed to bypass the thymidine kinase (TK) dependency of ZDV activation as well as to achieve spermicidal activity. We investigated the TK activity and intracellular metabolism of WHI-05 and WHI-07 in normal human vaginal and cervical epithelial cells as well as sperm. The time- and concentration-dependent intracellular formation of ZDV metabolites following addition of WHI-05 and WHI-07 to normal human vaginal, ectocervical, and endocervical epithelial cells as well as motile sperm was studied by analytical HPLC. Thymidine kinase activity in these cells was determined by the flow cytometric method based on intracellular phosphorylation of the fluorescent nucleoside, 5-amino-2-deoxyuridine-dansyl chloride and by the ability of cell-free extracts to convert [(3)H]thymidine to thymidine monophosphate in comparison to NALM-6, a pre-B leukemia cell line. TK activity of genital tract epithelial cells and sperm was found to be relatively low or lacking. Addition of WHI-05 and WHI-07 to vaginal and cervical epithelial cells resulted in their concentration- and time-dependent conversion to alaninyl ZDV monophosphate (Ala-ZDV-MP) and 5'-ZDV monophosphate as the major metabolites. Studies using motile human sperm also demonstrated the conversion of WHI-05 and WHI-07 to Ala-ZDV-MP. These results demonstrate that human female genital tract epithelial cells and sperm efficiently convert WHI-05 and WHI-07 to bioactive ZDV metabolites despite their TK deficiency.
20671097	Metabolism, excretion, and pharmacokinetics of oral brivanib in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The goal of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, mass balance, metabolism, routes and extent of elimination, and safety of a single oral dose of (14)C-labeled brivanib alaninate and the safety and tolerability of brivanib after multiple doses in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. This was a two-part, single-center, open-label, single oral-dose (part A) followed by multiple-dose (part B) study in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. In part A, patients received a single dose of [(14)C]brivanib alaninate and in part B patients received 800 mg of nonradiolabeled brivanib alaninate every day. Four patients (two white, two black: two with non-small-cell lung cancer, one with ovarian cancer, and one with renal cell carcinoma) were treated in both parts. The median time to reach the maximal plasma concentration of brivanib was 1 h, geometric mean maximal plasma concentration was 6146 ng/ml, mean terminal half-life was 13.8 h, and geometric mean apparent oral clearance was 14.7 l/h. After a single oral dose of [(14)C]brivanib alaninate, 12.2 and 81.5% of administered radioactivity was recovered in urine and feces, respectively. Brivanib alaninate was completely converted to the active moiety, brivanib, and the predominant route of elimination was fecal. Renal excretion of unchanged brivanib was minimal. Brivanib was well tolerated; fatigue was the most frequent adverse event occurring in all patients and the most frequent treatment-related adverse event in three (75%). The best clinical response in one patient was stable disease; the other three had progressive disease. Brivanib alaninate was rapidly absorbed and extensively metabolized after a single 800-mg oral dose; the majority of drug-related radioactivity was excreted in feces.
17624023	Characterization of cytochrome P450s mediating ipriflavone metabolism in human liver microsomes. Ipriflavone, a synthetic flavonoid for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, has been reported to be extensively metabolized in man to seven metabolites (M1-M7). This study was performed to characterize the human liver cytochrome P450s (CYP) responsible for the metabolism of ipriflavone. Hydroxylation at the beta-ring to M3, O-dealkylation to M1 and oxidation at isopropyl group to M4 and M5 are major pathways for ipriflavone metabolism in three different human liver microsome preparations. The specific CYPs responsible for ipriflavone oxidation to the active metabolites, M1, M3, M4 and M5 were identified using a combination of correlation analysis, immuno-inhibition, chemical inhibition in human liver microsomes and metabolism by expressed recombinant CYP enzymes. The inhibitory potencies of ipriflavone and its five metabolites, M1-M5 on seven clinically important CYPs were investigated in human liver microsomes. Our results demonstrate that CYP3A4 plays the major role in O-dealkylation of ipriflavone to M1 and CYP1A2 plays a dominant role in the formation of M3, M4 and M5. Ipriflavone and/or its five metabolites were found to inhibit potently the metabolism of CYPs 1A2, 2C8, 2C9 and 2C19 substrates.
16633717	In vitro characterization of the human biotransformation pathways of aplidine, a novel marine anti-cancer drug. Aplidine is a potent marine anti-cancer drug and is currently being investigated in phase II clinical trials. However, the enzymes involved in the biotransformation of aplidine and thus its pharmacokinetics are not known yet. To assess the biotransformation pathways of aplidine and their potential implications for human pharmacology and toxicology, the in vitro metabolism of aplidine was characterized using incubations with human plasma, liver preparations, cytochrome P450 (CYP) and uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase (UGT) supersomes in combination with HPLC analysis and cytotoxicity assays with cell lines. Aplidine was metabolised by carboxyl esterases in human plasma. Using CYP supersomes and liver microsomes, it was shown that aplidine was metabolised mainly by CYP3A4 and also by CYP2A6, 2E1 and 4A11. Four metabolites were observed after incubation with human liver microsomes, one formed by CYP2A6 (C-demethylation) and three by CYP3A4 (hydroxylation and/or C-dealkylation). No conjugation was observed in human liver S9 fraction. However, the aplidine metabolites formed by CYP were further conjugated by the phase II enzymes UGT, GST and SULT. In accordance with the findings in microsomes and CYP supersomes, a significant effect of specific CYP2A6, 2E1, 3A4 and 4A11 inhibitors on the cytotoxicity of aplidine in Hep G2 and IGROV-1 cells could be observed. These results provide evidence that CYP3A4 has a major role in metabolising aplidine in vitro with additional involvement of CYP2A6, 2E1, and 4A11. Further, the metabolites formed by CYPs can be conjugated by UGT, SULT and GST. These findings could help interpret the in vivo pharmacokinetics of aplidine.
22429874	Assessment of human deoxynivalenol exposure using an LC-MS/MS based biomarker method. The Fusarium toxin deoxynivalenol (DON) is one of the most abundant mycotoxins worldwide and poses many adverse health effects to human and animals. Consequently, regulatory limits and a provisional maximum tolerable daily intake (PMTDI) for this important type B-trichothecene were assigned. We conducted a pilot survey to investigate the level of DON exposure in Austrian adults by measurements of DON and its glucuronide conjugates (DON-GlcA's), as biomarkers of exposure, in first morning urine. The average concentration of total DON (free DON+DON-GlcA's) was estimated to be 20.4±2.4 μg L⁻¹ (max. 63 μg L⁻¹). Surprisingly, we found that one third of the volunteers (n=27) exceeded the established PMTDI when consuming regular diet. DON-GlcA's were directly quantified by LC-MS/MS and the results were compared with indirect quantification after enzymatic hydrolysis and confirmed the suitability of the direct method. Moreover, we investigated the in vivo metabolism of DON in humans and were able to determine two closely eluting DON-GlcA's in naturally contaminated urine samples for the first time. In contrast to previous findings we have tentatively identified DON-15-glucuronide as a major DON metabolite in human urine based on the analysis of these samples. About 75% of total glucuronides were derived from this metabolite while DON-3-glucuronide accounted for approximately 25%. The reported new findings clearly demonstrate the great potential of suitable biomarkers to critically assess exposure of humans and animals to DON.
11335786	A new prodrug of paclitaxel: synthesis of Protaxel. 2' and 7 Polyol carbonates of paclitaxel were synthesized and screened as potential paclitaxel prodrugs. Paclitaxel is released from 7-(2",3"-dihydroxypropylcarbonato) paclitaxel (Protaxel) at rates inversely proportional to pH, by an intramolecular cyclization. Compared to paclitaxel, maximum tolerated i.v. or i.p. doses (MTD) of Protaxel are about 2.5- to 3-fold higher; its efficacy is substantially higher in human cancer line xenografts in athymic mice, especially in prostate PC-3, breast MDA-MB 468 and ovary OVCAR-1.
16028005	Role of intestinal first-pass metabolism of baicalein in its absorption process. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of intestinal first-pass metabolism of baicalein (B) in its absorption process. The intestinal absorption of B was characterized using Caco-2 cell monolayer model and rat in situ single-pass intestinal perfusion model. In addition, preliminary metabolic kinetics of B was evaluated in both rat and human intestinal S9 fractions. B was well absorbed and extensively metabolized to baicalin (BG), baicalein-7-O-beta-glucuronide, in rat intestinal perfusion model, whereas less extent of metabolism was observed in the Caco-2 cell monolayer model. Moreover, BG generated in the intestinal epithelium during the absorption of B also rapidly transported to both the apical side (the apical chamber of Caco-2 model and the perfusate of the intestinal perfusion model) as well as the basolateral side of the small intestine (the basal chamber of Caco-2 model and the mesenteric vein of the intestinal perfusion model). From the preliminary metabolic studies, it was found that a higher loading dose of B resulted in a less extent of metabolism in intestine. In addition, the extent of metabolism of B was similar in jejunum and ileum when 50 microM of B was perfused through different sections of rat small intestine. The first-pass metabolism of B in small intestine may play an important role in its low oral bioavailability.
16019948	Identification of cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of 3',4'-methylenedioxy-alpha-pyrrolidinopropiophenone (MDPPP), a designer drug, in human liver microsomes. The metabolism of 3',4'-methylenedioxy-a-pyrrolidinopropiophenone (MDPPP), a novel designer drug, to its demethylenated major metabolite 3',4'-dihydroxy-pyrrolidinopropiophenone (di-HO-PPP) was studied in pooled human liver microsomes (HLM) and in cDNA-expressed human hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. CYP2C19 catalysed the demethylenation with apparent Km and Vmax values of 120.0+/-13.4 microM and 3.2+/-0.1 pmol/min/pmol CYP, respectively (mean+/-standard deviation). CYP2D6 catalysed the demethylenation with apparent Km and Vmax values of 13.5+/-1.5 microM and 1.3+/-0.1 pmol/min/pmol CYP, respectively. HLM exhibited a clear biphasic profile with an apparent Km,1 value of 7.6+/-9.0 and a Vmax,1 value of 11.1+/-3.6 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively. Percentages of intrinsic clearances of MDPPP by specific CYPs were calculated using the relative activity factor (RAF) approach with (S)-mephenytoin-4'-hydroxylation or bufuralol-1'-hydroxylation as index reactions for CYP2C19 or CYP2D6, respectively. MDPPP, di-HO-PPP and the standard 4'-methyl-pyrrolidinohexanophenone (MPHP) were separated and analysed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in the selected-ion monitoring (SIM) mode. The CYP2D6-specific chemical inhibitor quinidine (3 microM) significantly (p<0.001) inhibited di-HO-PPP formation by 75.8%+/-1.7% (mean+/-standard error of the mean) in incubation mixtures with HLM and 2 microM MDPPP. It can be concluded from the data obtained from kinetic and inhibition studies that polymorphically expressed CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 are almost equally responsible for MDPPP demethylenation.
11583481	Lack of pharmacokinetic interaction between rofecoxib and methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Rofecoxib is a highly selective and potent inhibitor of cyclooxgenase-2 (COX-2). Methotrexate is a disease-modifying agent with a narrow therapeutic index frequently prescribed for the management of rheumatoid arthritis. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of clinical doses of rofecoxib on the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 25 rheumatoid arthritis patients on stable doses of methotrexate. Patients received oral methotrexate (7.5 to 20 mg) on days -1, 7, 14, and 21. Nineteen patients received rofecoxib 12.5, 25, and 50 mg once daily on days 1 to 7, 8 to 14, and 15 to 21, respectively. Six patients received placebo on days 1 to 21 only to maintain a double-blinded design for assessment of adverse experiences. Plasma and urine samples were analyzed for methotrexate and its major although inactive metabolite, 7-hydroxymethotrexate. The AUC(0-infinity) geometric mean ratios (GMR) and their 90% confidence intervals (90% CI) (rofecoxib + methotrexate/methotrexate alone) for day 7/day -1, day 14/day -1, and day 21/day -1, for rofecoxib 12.5, 25, and 50 mg, were 1.03 (0.93, 1.14), 1.02 (0.92, 1.12), and 1.06 (0.96, 1.17), respectively (p > 0.2 for all comparisons to day -1). All AUC(0-infinity), GMR and Cmax GMR 90% CIs fell within the predefined comparability limits of (0.80, 1.25). Similar results were observed for renal clearance of methotrexate and 7-hydroxymethotrexate at the highest dose of rofecoxib tested (50 mg). It was concluded that rofecoxib at doses of 12.5, 25, and 50 mg once daily has no effect on the plasma concentrations or renal clearance (tested at the highest dose of rofecoxib) of methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis patients.
20110038	The effects of ketoconazole and rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics of mirodenafil in healthy Korean male volunteers: an open-label, one-sequence, three-period, three-treatment crossover study. Mirodenafil, a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor reported to be effective in the treatment of erectile dysfunction, is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 to the active metabolite N-dehydroxyethyl mirodenafil. Mirodenafil may have drug-drug interactions with ketoconazole and/or rifampicin. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a potent inhibitor (ketoconazole) and inducer (rifampicin) of the CYP3A4 isozyme on the pharmacokinetics of mirodenafil to meet the regulatory requirements for the marketing of mirodenafil in Korea. An open-label, 1-sequence, 3-period, 3-treatment crossover study was conducted over 22 days in healthy Korean male volunteers. Each subject received 100 mg of mirodenafil in each of 3 study periods: mirodenafil alone (period 1); mirodenafil after pretreatment with ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 3 days (period 2); and mirodenafil after pretreatment with rifampicin 600 mg once daily for 10 days (period 3). Serial blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis after the administration of mirodenafil in each study period. Plasma concentration-time data for mirodenafil and its major metabolite, N-dehydroxyethyl mirodenafil, were determined using LC-MS/MS and analyzed by a noncompartmental method. The results for mirodenafil coadministration with either ketoconazole or rifampicin were compared with those for mirodenafil alone. Adverse events (AEs) were identified by asking general health-related questions of the subjects, by physical examination, and by subject self-report throughout the study period. Nineteen subjects were enrolled (mean [SD] age, 23.2 [2.76] years [range, 19-29 years]; weight, 69.3 [6.50] kg [range, 61.0-84.0 kg]; body mass index, 22.4 [1.77] kg/m(2) [range, 20.0-26.0 kg/m(2)]) and 18 subjects completed the study. One subject discontinued the study due to protocol violation and was replaced. The AUC(0-infinity) of mirodenafil increased 5.04-fold (90% CI, 3.78-6.72) and the metabolic ratio decreased 0.21-fold after pretreatment with ketoconazole compared with mirodenafil alone. After pretreatment with rifampicin, the AUC(0-infinity) of mirodenafil decreased 0.03-fold (90% CI, 0.02-0.05) and the metabolic ratio increased 2.9-fold. Twelve cases of headache, 6 of nasal congestion, 2 of feeling hot, 2 of epistaxis, and 1 each of dizziness, nausea, and somnolence were considered to be related to administration of mirodenafil. Twenty-eight AEs were reported in period 2 (in 68.4% of subjects), during which systemic exposure to mirodenafil was highest, whereas 7 AEs were reported in period 1 (in 31.6% of subjects) and 5 AEs in period 3 (in 16.7% of subjects). In these healthy Korean male volunteers, the coadministration of ketoconazole and rifampicin resulted in significant changes in systemic exposure to mirodenafil.
20923245	Effects of rifampicin (rifampin) on the pharmacokinetics and safety of ambrisentan in healthy subjects: a single-sequence, open-label study. Ambrisentan is a once-daily, endothelin (ET) type A receptor-selective antagonist approved for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Ambrisentan is primarily metabolized by glucuronidation and undergoes cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated oxidation to a lesser extent. To assess the effects of rifampicin (rifampin), a potent inducer of CYP3A4 and inhibitor of organic anion transporter polypeptides (OATPs), on the steady-state pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of ambrisentan. This was a 14-day, single-sequence, open-label study that was conducted in 24 healthy adults. Subjects were administered oral doses of ambrisentan (10 mg) once daily on days 1 through 5 and were then co-administered ambrisentan (10 mg) plus rifampicin (600 mg) once daily on days 6 through 13. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of ambrisentan and its oxidative metabolite 4-hydroxymethyl ambrisentan were determined in the absence and presence of repeated administration of rifampicin. The main outcome measure was the analysis of ambrisentan pharmacokinetics (area under the plasma concentration-time curve during a dosage interval [AUC(τ)], maximum plasma drug concentration [C(max)] and minimum plasma drug concentration [C(min)]) for steady-state ambrisentan alone (day 5) as compared with steady-state ambrisentan plus steady-state rifampicin (day 13). Adverse events (AEs), ECG recordings, vital signs and clinical laboratory parameters were monitored throughout the study and at follow-up. A transient increase (+87% [95% CI 79, 95]) in ambrisentan steady-state systemic exposure (AUC(τ)) was observed during the first 2 days of rifampicin co-administration. However, in the presence of steady-state rifampicin, ambrisentan C(max) and AUC(τ) values were similar (+2% [95% CI -7, 12] and -4% [-9, 2], respectively) to those observed for ambrisentan alone. Relative systemic exposure of 4-hydroxymethyl ambrisentan was unaffected by either acute or steady-state rifampicin. No serious AEs or AEs leading to withdrawal were reported and there were no clinically significant changes in vital signs, ECG recordings or clinical laboratory parameters with co-administration of ambrisentan and rifampicin. Steady-state rifampicin had no clinically relevant effects on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of ambrisentan. The overall safety profile of ambrisentan was similar in the presence and absence of rifampicin. No dose adjustment of ambrisentan should be required when it is co-administered with rifampicin, a strong inducer of CYP3A4 activity and inhibitor of OATPs.
17980680	Validation of a sensitive LC-MS assay for quantification of glyburide and its metabolite 4-transhydroxy glyburide in plasma and urine: an OPRU Network study. Glyburide (glibenclamide, INN), a second generation sulfonylurea is widely used in the treatment of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). None of the previously reported analytical methods provide adequate sensitivity for the expected sub-nanogram/mL maternal and umbilical cord plasma concentrations of glyburide during pregnancy. We developed and validated a sensitive and low sample volume liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometric (LC-MS) method for simultaneous determination of glyburide (GLY) and its metabolite, 4-transhydroxy glyburide (M1) in human plasma (0.5 mL) or urine (0.1 mL). The limits of quantitation (LOQ) for GLY and M1 in plasma were 0.25 and 0.40 ng/mL, respectively whereas it was 1.06 ng/mL for M1 in urine. As measured by quality control samples, precision (% coefficient of variation) of the assay was <15% whereas the accuracy (% deviation from expected) ranged from -10.1 to 14.3%. We found that the GLY metabolite, M1 is excreted in the urine as the glucuronide-conjugate.
15229170	Species differential stereoselective oxidation of a methylsulfide metabolite of MK-0767 [(+/-)-5-[(2,4-dioxothiazolidin-5-yl)methyl]-2-methoxy-N-[[(4-trifluoromethyl)phenyl]methyl]benzamide], a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor dual agonist. MK-0767 [(+/-)-5-[(2,4-dioxothiazolidin-5-yl)methyl]-2-methoxy-N-[[(4-trifluoromethyl)phenyl]methyl]benzamide], a thiazolidinedione (TZD)-containing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonist, is a rapidly interconverting racemate that possesses a chiral center at the five position of the TZD ring. M25 is a methyl sulfide metabolite generated from MK-0767 following CYP3A4-mediated TZD ring opening and subsequent methylation of the sulfide intermediate M22. M25, a major in vitro and in vivo metabolite, was further metabolized in liver microsomes to the methyl sulfoxide amide (M16) with two chiral centers and the methyl sulfone amide (M20) with one chiral center. Previous studies demonstrated that both CYP3A4 and flavin monooxygenase-3 (FMO3) catalyzed the formation of M16, whereas M20 was formed exclusively by CYP3A4. The relative contribution of CYP3A4 and FMO3 in the formation of M16 in human and preclinical species was evaluated by chiral analysis using supercritical fluid chromatography. No stereoselectivity was observed in incubations of M25 with human and rhesus liver and recombinant CYP3A4 microsomes, whereas a high degree of stereoselectivity (63 to >99% enantiomeric excess) was observed in rat and dog liver and human recombinant FMO3 microsomes. Also, polyclonal anti-rat CYP3A2 antibody and cytochrome P450 (P450) chemical inhibitors did not inhibit the oxidation of M25 in rat liver microsomes. Furthermore, M25 oxidation was more sensitive to heat inactivation at pH 8 and 8.7 in rat and dog liver microsomes than in human and monkey liver microsomes, consistent with the species difference in involvement of FMOs. Collectively, these results indicated that S-oxidation of M25 was catalyzed primarily by P450 enzymes in human and monkey liver microsomes and by FMO enzymes in rat and dog liver microsomes.
15336377	Simultaneous determination of serum flecainide and its metabolites by using high performance liquid chromatography. Simultaneous determination of serum flecainide and its oxidative metabolites was carried out by using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with conventional octadecylsilyl silica (ODS) column and fluorescence detector. Flecainide and its metabolites, m-O-dealkylated flecainide (MODF) and m-O-dealkylated lactam of flecainide (MODLF) in serum were extracted with ethyl acetate. The recoveries of flecainide, MODF and MODLF were greater than 92, 93, and 60% with the coefficient of variations (CVs) less than 3.2, 5.8, and 5.3%, respectively. The calibration curves were linear at the concentration range of 50-1500 ng/mL for flecainide and 10-500 ng/mL for MODF and MODLF (r > 0.999). The CVs for intra-day assay were 2.7-5.3% for flecainide, 3.0-4.2% for MODF, and 3.7-4.3% for MODLF, respectively. The CVs for inter-day assay were 7.0-8.4% for flecainide, 3.3-6.7% for MODF, and 4.4-7.7% for MODLF, respectively. This assay method can be used for assessing the metabolic ability of flecainide in the patients with tachyarrhythmia.
21657966	In vitro metabolism of dexamethasone cipecilate, a novel synthetic corticosteroid, in human liver and nasal mucosa. Dexamethasone cipecilate (DX-CP, 9-fluoro-11β,17,21-trihydroxy-16α-methylpregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione 21-cyclohexanecarboxylate 17-cyclopropanecarboxylate) is a novel synthetic corticosteroid used to treat allergic rhinitis. The pharmacological effect of DX-CP is considered to be mainly due to its active de-esterified metabolite (DX-17-CPC). To investigate the in vitro metabolism of DX-CP in human liver, DX-CP was incubated with human liver microsomes and S9. In addition, a metabolism study of DX-CP with human nasal mucosa was carried out in order to elucidate whether DX-17-CPC is formed in nasal mucosa, the site of action of DX-CP. DX-17-CPC was the major metabolite in both liver microsomes and S9. Two new epoxide metabolites, UK1 and UK2, were detected in liver S9, while only UK1 was detected in liver microsomes. This suggests that cytosol enzymes are responsible for the formation of UK2. In human nasal mucosa, DX-CP was mainly transformed into DX-17-CPC. By using recombinant human carboxylesterases (CESs), the reaction was shown to be catalyzed by CES2. These results provide the evidence that the active metabolite DX-17-CPC is the main contributor to the pharmacological action after the intranasal administration of DX-CP to humans.
17661339	Characterization of metabolites of a NK1 receptor antagonist, CJ-11,972, in human liver microsomes and recombinant human CYP isoforms by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. The in vitro metabolism of CJ-11,972, (2-benzhydryl-1-aza-bicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl)-(5-tert-butyl-2-methoxybenzyl)amine, an NK1 receptor antagonist, was studied in human liver microsomes and recombinant human CYP isoforms. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) coupled to radioactive detection were used to detect and identify the metabolites. CJ-11,972 was extensively metabolized in human liver microsomes and recombinant human CYP 3A4/3A5 isoforms. A total of fourteen metabolites were identified by a combination of various MS techniques. The major metabolic pathways were due to oxidation of the tert-butyl moiety to form an alcohol (M6) and/or O-demethylation of the anisole moiety. The alcohol metabolite M6 was further oxidized to the corresponding aldehyde (M7) and carboxylic acid (M4). Two unusual metabolites (M13, M17), formed by C-demethylation of the tert-butyl group, were identified as 2-{3-[(2-benzhydryl-1-aza-bicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-ylamino)methyl]-4-methoxyphenyl}propan-2-ol and (2-benzhydryl-1-aza-bicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl)-(5-isopropenyl-2-methoxybenzyl)amine. A plausible mechanism for C-demethylation may involve oxidation of M6 to form an aldehyde metabolite (M7), followed by cytochrome P450-mediated deformylation leaving an unstable carbon-centered radical, which would quickly form either the alcohol metabolite M13 and the olefin metabolite M17.
19688720	Stability of cucurbitacin E in human plasma: chemical hydrolysis and role of plasma esterases. It was shown previously that the anticancerous cytotoxic oxygenated triterpenes, cucurbitacin E (Cuc E) and its deacetylated form, cucurbitacin I (Cuc I), interacted differently with human serum albumin. In this study, the biochemical stability of Cuc E was investigated in vitro by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The hydrolysis rate in acidic and alkaline solutions, and in enzymatic conditions in human plasma and in purified plasma esterase solutions of butyrylcholinesterase and albumin, was compared with that measured in phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.4). Cuc E hydrolysis was detected in all the in vitro tests, but the extent of hydrolysis varied according to the different enzymatic and non-enzymatic conditions. A remarkable rapid hydrolysis of Cuc E was detected in acidic and alkaline solutions. A significant rate of hydrolysis of Cuc E was monitored in human plasma and was associated with the detection of Cuc I. The stability of Cuc E was greatly enhanced in the presence of albumin. However, purified butyrylcholinesterase had no effect on Cuc E stability. Among specific inhibitors of plasma esterases, only EDTA increased Cuc E stability, suggesting that paraoxonase is the human plasma esterase involved in the hydrolysis of Cuc E.
19916998	Albendazole and its metabolites in the breast milk of lactating women following a single oral dose of albendazole. Albendazole (ABZ) is used in several anthelminthic drug programs. ABZ side-effects are generally mild, but ABZ-induced pancytopenia may be serious. In filariasis programmes, it may be necessary to administer ABZ to breastfeeding women. Few data are available on safety of ABZ for breastfed infants. In addition, the pharmacokinetics of ABZ and its metabolites in human milk is insufficiently investigated. The aim was to study pharmacokinetics of ABZ and its metabolites [ABZ sulphoxide (ABSX) and ABZ sulphone] in the breast milk lactating women after one single oral dose of ABZ. Thirty-three lactating women (age 18-40 years) participated in the study. They received a single oral 400-mg dose of ABZ. Five milk samples were taken at 0, 6, 12, 24 and 36 h. One serum sample was taken after 6 h. Samples were analysed using high-performance liquid chromatography and pharmacokinetic analysis was performed. ABZ was detectable in milk samples 6 h after the oral dose. The mean concentration of serum ABZ was 63.7 +/- 11.9 ng ml(-1). The pharmacokinetic parameters for ABSX were calculated as follows: 351.9 +/- 32.4 ng ml(-1), 6.9 +/- 0.5 h, 12.4 +/- 2.2 h and 5190.3 +/- 482.8 ng*h ml(-1) for C(max), T(max), t((1/2)) and AUC(0-36), respectively. The milk-to-serum ratios (range) for ABZ and ABSX were 0.9 (0.2-6.5) and 0.6 (0.1-1.5), respectively. After an oral dose of 400 mg, ABZ and ABSX attain low concentrations in breast milk that are unlikely to be considered harmful for the breastfed infant.
17050648	CYP2B6, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 catalyze the primary oxidative metabolism of perhexiline enantiomers by human liver microsomes. The cytochrome P450 (P450)-mediated 4-monohydroxylations of the individual enantiomers of the racemic antianginal agent perhexiline (PHX) were investigated in human liver microsomes (HLMs) to identify stereoselective differences in metabolism and to determine the contribution of the polymorphic enzyme CYP2D6 and other P450s to the intrinsic clearance of each enantiomer. The cis-, trans1-, and trans2-4-monohydroxylation rates of (+)- and (-)-PHX by human liver microsomes from three extensive metabolizers (EMs), two intermediate metabolizers (IMs), and two poor metabolizers (PMs) of CYP2D6 were measured with a high-performance liquid chromatography assay. P450 isoform-specific inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies directed against P450 isoforms, and recombinantly expressed human P450 enzymes were used to define the P450 isoform profile of PHX 4-monohydroxylations. The total in vitro intrinsic clearance values (mean +/- S.D.) of (+)- and (-)-PHX were 1376 +/- 330 and 2475 +/- 321, 230 +/- 225 and 482 +/- 437, and 63.4 +/- 1.6 and 54.6 +/- 1.2 microl/min/mg for the EM, IM, and PM HLMs, respectively. CYP2D6 catalyzes the formation of cis-OH-(+)-PHX and trans1-OH-(+)-PHX from (+)-PHX and cis-OH-(-)-PHX from (-)-PHX with high affinity. CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 each catalyze the trans1- and trans2-4-monohydroxylation of both (+)- and (-)-PHX with low affinity. Both enantiomers of PHX are subject to significant polymorphic metabolism by CYP2D6, although this enzyme exhibits distinct stereoselectivity with respect to the conformation of metabolites and the rate at which they are formed. CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 are minor contributors to the intrinsic P450-mediated hepatic clearance of both enantiomers of PHX, except in CYP2D6 PMs.
20478851	Metabolism of flumatinib, a novel antineoplastic tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in chronic myelogenous leukemia patients. 4-(4-Methyl-piperazin-1-ylmethyl)-N-[6-methyl-5-(4-pyridin-3-yl-pyrimidin-2-ylamino)-pyridin-3-yl]-3-trifluoromethyl-benzamide (flumatinib, HH-GV678), an antineoplastic tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is currently in Phase I clinical trials in China for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The purpose of this study was to identify the metabolites of flumatinib in CML patients, with the aim of determining the main metabolic pathways of flumatinib in humans after oral administration. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry revealed 34 metabolites; 7 primary metabolites were confirmed by comparison with synthetic reference standards. The results show that the parent drug flumatinib was the main form recovered in human plasma, urine, and feces. The main metabolites of flumatinib in humans were the products of N-demethylation, N-oxidation, hydroxylation, and amide hydrolysis. In addition to these phase I metabolites, several phase II glucuronidation and acetylation products were detected in plasma, urine, and feces. The observed circulating metabolites included an N-demethylated metabolite (M1), two hydrolytic metabolites (M3, M4), oxidation metabolites (M2-1, M2-4, M2-7, M2-9, and M14), a glucuronide conjugate (M16-2), and several multiple metabolic products. Flumatinib was predominantly metabolized by amide bond cleavage to yield two corresponding hydrolytic products. By comparison with the related drug 4-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-ylmethyl)-N-[4-methyl-3-(4-pyridin-3-yl-pyrimidin-2-ylamino)-phenyl]-benzamide (imatinib), we concluded that the electron-withdrawing groups of trifluoromethyl and pyridine facilitated the amide bond cleavage and led to the in vivo formation of a carboxylic acid and an amine.
16280263	Identification and quantitative determination of benproperine metabolites in human plasma and urine by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Two novel metabolites of benproperine (BPP), 1-[1-methyl-2-[2-(phenylmethyl)phenoxy]ethyl]-3-piperidinol (3-OH-BPP) and 1-[1-methyl-2-[2-(phenylmethyl)phenoxy]ethyl]-4-piperidinol (4-OH-BPP), were confirmed by comparison of retention times and mass spectra with those of synthetic standards using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Selective and sensitive procedures were developed for the simultaneous determination of BPP, 3-OH-BPP and 4-OH-BPP in human plasma and urine. The analytes were extracted from plasma sample and enzymatically hydrolyzed urine samples by liquid-liquid extraction, separated through a Diamonsil C(18) column (150 mm x 4.6 mm i.d.) and determined by tandem mass spectrometry with an electrospray ionization interface in selected reaction monitoring mode. Dextromethorphan was used as internal standard. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile-water-formic acid (34:66:1, v/v/v), and flow-rate was 0.5 ml min(-1). This method has a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 60, 4.0 and 4.0 nmol l(-1)for BPP, 3-OH-BPP and 4-OH-BPP in plasma, 4.9, 4.7 and 2.4 nmol l(-1) in urine, respectively. The intra- and inter-run precision were measured to be below 9.2%, and the accuracy was within +/-4.3% for the analytes. The method was successfully used to determine BPP, 3-OH-BPP and 4-OH-BPP in plasma and urine for pharmacokinetic investigation. The results indicated residue of 3-OH-BPP in the body at least 192 h after an oral dose of BPP.
18033636	Metabolism of CJ-036878, N-(3-phenethoxybenzyl)-4-hydroxybenzamide, in liver microsomes and recombinant cytochrome P450 enzymes: metabolite identification by LC-UV/MS(n) and (1)H-NMR. The identification of metabolites in the early stages of drug discovery is important not only for guiding structure-activity relationships (SAR) and structure-metabolism relationships (SMR) strategies, but also for predicting the potential for adverse events. The present study investigated the phase I metabolism of CJ-036878 (N-(3-phenethoxybenzyl)-4-hydroxybenzamide), a potent antagonist of the N-methyl-D-asparatate (NMDA) receptor, using liver microsomes and representative recombinant cytochrome P450 enzymes. The structures of the oxidative metabolites M1-M11 were confirmed by LC-UV/MS(n) and/or (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). It was found that CJ-036878 is metabolized through three routes: (1) aliphatic hydroxylation that generates M1 and M2; (2) aromatic hydroxylation that produces M3-M5, M7 and M8; and (3) dimerization through an oxidative phenol coupling reaction that yields M10 and M11. The use of recombinant human cytochrome P450 enzymes suggested that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the oxidative metabolism of CJ-036878, with minor contributions from CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.
17080401	4-Aminobiphenyl N-glucuronidation by liver microsomes: optimization of the reaction conditions and characterization of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase isoforms. 4-Aminobiphenyl (4-ABP) is an arylamine that has long been associated with human and animal urinary bladder cancer. N-glucuronidation is an important metabolic pathway that contributes significantly to 4-ABP-bladder carcinogenesis by facilitating transport of the active metabolites from the liver to the bladder. This pathway is carried out by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGTs). These enzymes are located in the inner membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. Full UGT activity is not achieved until membrane constraints are removed. This study was conducted to optimize the incubation conditions of 4-ABP N-glucuronidation. The kinetic parameters of the isozymes most commonly involved in arylamine glucuronidation, namely UGT1A4 and UGT1A9, were also determined. The UGT reaction was linear in the incubation time (0-90 min) and in the microsomal protein range of 0-0.5 mg. Alamethicin, a pore-forming agent, was found to be the best reagent to activate UGTs. It increased the enzyme activity by nearly 8-fold and this activation was at concentration of 50 microg mg(-1) protein. Interestingly, UGT1A4 glucuronidated 4-ABP with more affinity and efficiency than did UGT1A9. The K(m) and V(max) of UGT1A4 for 4-ABP were 58.8 microm and 234.9 pmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein, respectively, and 227.5 microm and 31.2 pmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein for UGT1A9. Furthermore, hecogenin was found to be a competitive inhibitor for UGT1A4. It increased the K(m) of UGT1A4 for 4-ABP by nearly 10 fold at a concentration of 50 microm. This is the first report that tried to optimize the incubation conditions for 4-ABP N-glucuronidation and characterized the enzyme kinetic parameters of UGT isoforms catalysing 4-ABP N-glucuronidation.
16501008	Human cytochrome p450 induction and inhibition potential of clevidipine and its primary metabolite h152/81. Clevidipine is a short-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist under development for treatment of perioperative hypertension. Patients treated with clevidipine are likely to be comedicated. Therefore, the potential for clevidipine and its major metabolite H152/81 to elicit drug interactions by induction or inhibition of cytochrome P450 was investigated. Induction of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 was examined in primary human hepatocytes treated with clevidipine at 1, 10, and 100 microM. Clevidipine was found to be an inducer of CYP3A4, but not of CYP1A2 or CYP2C9, at the 10 microM and 100 microM concentrations of clevidipine tested. Induction response for CYP3A4 to 100 microM clevidipine was approximately 20% of that of the positive control inducer rifampicin. The response of H152/81 was similar. Using cDNA-expressed enzymes, clevidipine inhibited CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 activities with IC(50) values below 10 microM, whereas CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1 activities were not substantially inhibited (IC(50) values >70 microM). The K(i) values for CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 were 1.7 and 3.3 microM, respectively, and those for CYP3A4 were 8.3 and 2.9 microM, using two substrates, testosterone and midazolam, respectively. These values are at least 10 times higher than the highest clevidipine concentration typically seen in the clinic. Little or no inhibition by H152/81 was found for the enzyme activities mentioned above (IC(50) values >or= 69 microM). The present study demonstrates that it is highly unlikely for clevidipine or its major metabolite to cause cytochrome P450-related drug interactions when used in the dose range required to manage hypertension in humans.
15258113	Sequential metabolism of 2,3,7-trichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7-triCDD) by cytochrome P450 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase in human liver microsomes. Metabolism of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins by cytochrome P450 (P450) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) was examined using a recombinant enzyme system and human liver microsomes. We analyzed the glucuronidation of 2,3,7-trichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7-triCDD) by rat CYP1A1 expressed in yeast microsomes and human UGT expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells. Multiple UGT isozymes showed glucuronidation activity toward 8-hydroxy-2,3,7-triCDD (8-OH-2,3,7-triCDD), which was produced by CYP1A1. Of these UGTs, UGT1A1, 1A9, and 2B7, which are constitutively expressed in human livers, showed remarkable activity toward 8-OH-2,3,7-triCDD. The apparent kinetic parameters of glucuronidation, K(m) and k(cat), were estimated to be 0.8 microM and 1.8 min(-1), respectively, for UGT1A1, 0.8 microM and 1.8 min(-1), respectively, for UGT1A9, and 3.9 microM and 7.0 min(-1), respectively, for UGT2B7. In human liver microsomes with NADPH and UDP-glucuronic acid, 2,3,7-triCDD was first converted to 8-OH-2,3,7-triCDD, then further converted to its glucuronide. We compared the ability of 10 human liver microsomes to metabolize 2,3,7-triCDD and observed a significant difference in the glucuronidation of 2,3,7-triCDD that originated from the difference of the P450-dependent hydroxylation of 2,3,7-triCDD.
17094953	Investigation of the genotoxicity of dibenzo[c,p]chrysene in human carcinoma MCF-7 cells in culture. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous environmental pollutants that have been linked to certain human cancers. The fjord region PAH dibenzo[a,l]pyrene exhibits the highest levels of carcinogenic activity of all PAH as yet tested in rodent tumor models. Another hexacyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, dibenzo[c,p]chrysene (DBC), is a unique PAH that possesses one bay region and two fjord regions within the same molecule. Due to its structure, which is a merger of the fjord region PAHs benzo[c]phenanthrene, benzo[c]chrysene, and benzo[g]chrysene, DBC is of considerable research interest. In order to investigate the pathway of regioselective metabolism we have studied the cytotoxicity, metabolic activation and DNA adduct formation of DBC in human mammary carcinoma MCF-7 cells in culture. The cytotoxicity assay indicated undisturbed cell proliferation even at concentrations as high as 4.5 microM (1.5 micro g/ml) DBC. Concurrently, DNA adducts were detected in MCF-7 cells treated with DBC only in low amounts (0.6 pmol adducts/mg DNA). On the contrary, exposure to anti-DBC-1,2-diol-3,4-epoxide and anti-DBC-11,12-diol-13,14-epoxide, two putatively genotoxic metabolites of DBC, resulted in high levels of DNA adducts (33 and 51 pmol adducts/mg DNA, respectively). Although DBC was not efficiently transformed into DNA-reactive metabolites in MCF-7 cells in culture, the results from our study indicate that the two fjord region diol-epoxide derivatives of DBC may serve as ultimate genotoxic metabolites once they are enzymatically generated under certain circumstances in vitro or in vivo.
12731658	Determination of the herbicide glyphosate and its metabolite in biological specimens by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A case of poisoning by roundup herbicide. In Japan, poisonings by the glyphosate (GLYP)-containing herbicide Roundup and the gluphosinate (GLUF)-based herbicide BASTA have been increasing since about 1987. We applied the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method of analysis, on which we have already reported in regard to the determination of the blood serum level of GLUF and its metabolite, for the determination of serum and urinary levels of GLYP and its metabolite aminomethyl phosphonic acid (AMPA). Derivatization using N-methyl-N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide was completed at a temperature of 80 degrees C after 30 min, and the detection limit of GLYP was 10 pg using m/z 454 and that of AMPA was 1 pg using m/z 396. The full mass spectra of 100 pg GLYP and of 10 pg AMPA were obtained easily. In extractions for which the Isolute HAX cartridge was employed, the mean recovery rate of GLYP and AMPA added to serum to yield concentrations of 10-0.1 microg/mL (n = 5) was 91.6 +/- 10.6% (or better), whereas that of GLYP and AMPA added to urine to yield concentrations of 100-1.0 microg/mL (n = 10) was 93.3 +/- 6.6% (or better), both of which were good rates. Also, using this method of analysis, the presence of GLYP was identified in the full mass spectra obtained from the serum of a patient who may or may not have ingested Roundup.
16531475	Autoinduction of MKC-963 [(R)-1-(1-cyclohexylethylamino)-4-phenylphthalazine] metabolism in healthy volunteers and its retrospective evaluation using primary human hepatocytes and cDNA-expressed enzymes. MKC-963, (R)-1-(1-cyclohexylethylamino)-4-phenylphthalazine, a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation, was synthesized and used in clinical trials in the 1990s. In the process of clinical study, it was found that urinary excretion ratios for 6beta-hydroxycortisol and free cortisol increased significantly in parallel with decreases in the plasma concentrations of MKC-963 after repeated oral administration of the compound to healthy volunteers. These findings suggested that MKC-963 caused autoinduction (defined as the ability of a drug to induce enzymes that enhance its own metabolism, resulting in dispositional tolerance) in humans, and clinical studies using the compound were stopped. This experience prompted us to reevaluate the effects of this compound on CYP3A4 using primary human hepatocytes and cDNA-expressed human cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes to determine whether the autoinduction of MKC-963 metabolism in humans could have been predicted if these in vitro systems had been used for the evaluation of MKC-963 in the preclinical study. The results of in vitro study showed that MKC-963 increased CYP3A4 mRNA expression level and activity of testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation to extents similar to those observed with rifampicin in primary human hepatocytes. In addition, approximately 90% of the MKC-963 metabolism in human liver microsomes was estimated to be attributable to CYP3A4. These in vitro findings are in good agreement with the results of clinical study, suggesting that studies using human hepatocytes and cDNA-expressed human P450s are useful for assessing the autoinductive nature of compounds under development before starting clinical studies.
21346003	Metabolism of LY654322, a growth hormone secretagogue, to an unusual diimidazopyridine metabolite. 2-Methylalanyl-N-{1-[(1R)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-2-oxo-2-pyrrolidin-1-ylethyl]-1H-imidazol-4-yl}-5-phenyl-D-norvalinamide (LY654322) was rapidly cleared in rats and dogs by renal excretion of parent and metabolism (oxidative and hydrolytic). Among the metabolites identified in the urine of rats and dogs was M25, which was structurally unusual. Indeed, the characterization of M25 and investigation into its disposition relied on the convergence of diverse analytical methodologies. M25 eluted after the parent on reverse-phase chromatography with an MH(+) at m/z 598 (parent + 35 Da). Given its increased lipophilicity and its mass difference compared with the parent, it was evident that M25 was not a phase 2 conjugate. Subsequent liquid chromatography with multiple-stage tandem mass spectrometry and accurate mass experiments identified the structure of M25 as having two replicates of the 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-2-oxo-2-pyrrolidinyl substructure flanking a central aromatic core of composition C(7)H(3)N(5) that was refractory to fragmentation. Compared with the UV spectrum of the parent (λ(max) = 213 nm), M25 displayed a bathochromic shift (λ(max) = 311 nm), which substantiated extensive conjugation within the central core. Subsequent NMR analysis of M25 isolated from dog urine coupled with molecular modeling revealed the structure to be consistent with a diimidazopyridine core with two symmetrically substituted 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-2-oxo-2-pyrrolidinyl moieties. Using a structural analog with a chromophore similar to M25, LC-UV was used to quantitate M25 and determine its urinary disposition. The formation of M25 appears consistent with hydrolysis of LY654322 to an aminoimidazole, dimerization of the latter with the loss of NH(3), C-formylation, and subsequent ring closure and aromatization with loss of H(2)O.
18690683	Quantification of alkylresorcinol metabolites in plasma by high-performance liquid chromatography with coulometric electrode array detection. This study presents the optimization and validation of a rapid protocol for quantifying alkyresorcinol (AR) metabolites 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) and 3-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)-1-propanoic acid (DHPPA) in plasma, using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with a coulometric electrode array detector. Syringic acid (SyrA) serves as the internal standard. The new method is simple and could be used in large epidemiological studies. The summed AR metabolite concentrations measured in plasma correlate significantly with the summed urinary AR metabolite concentrations (R = 0.613; p < 0.001) and with the summed intact AR (C17:0-C25:0) concentrations in plasma (R = 0.686; p < 0.001). Additional investigation is needed to clarify whether the two plasma AR metabolites are useful as biomarkers of whole-grain intake and helpful in the exploration of the association between whole-grain cereal intake and human diseases.
16502355	A phase I clinical and pharmacokinetic study of CS-682 administered orally in advanced malignant solid tumors. CS-682 (1-(2-C-cyano-2-deoxy-beta-D-arabino-pentofuranosyl)-N4-palmitoylcytosine) is a novel orally administered 2'-deoxycytidine-type antimetabolite, which has a wide spectrum of antitumor activity in human tumor xenograft models. We conducted a phase I study to define the toxicity, pharmacokinetics and antitumor activity of CS-682 in patients with advanced solid tumors. Forty patients were enrolled to receive escalating doses of CS-682. CS-682 was given orally, once daily three times a week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday), for four weeks consecutively, followed by a two-week rest period. Twenty-two men and 18 women, median age 63.5 (range 31 to 82) were treated. The most common tumor type was colorectal cancer with 15 patients. Others tumors occurring in 3 or more patients included prostate, breast and lung carcinomas. Sixty percent of the patients had received greater than 2 prior chemotherapy programs. Patients have been treated at each of the following dose levels (mg/m2/day): 1.5, 12, 20, 25, 30, 50, 67, 90, 120, 160 and 220. Non hematologic toxicities grade 3 [NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (version 2.0)] related to treatment included nausea in 2, vomiting in 1, anorexia and asthenia in 2, and dehydration in 1. Severe hematologic toxicities (grade 3-4) were seen more frequently with 10 patients experiencing grade 3-4 neutropenia, 2 with grade 4 thrombocytopenia and 2 with grade 3 anemia. Neutropenia requiring hospitalization occurred in 3 patients. Dose-limiting neutropenia was observed at 220 mg/m2/day. The maximum tolerated dose was determined to be 160 mg/m2/day. No tumor responses were observed in this study. Six patients experienced stable disease, including one who has stable disease after having received 34 courses of CS-682. After oral administration, CS-682 is rapidly absorbed and metabolized to CNDAC, which is further metabolized by cytidine deaminase to the inactive product CNDAU. Peak plasma concentrations of CNDAC were achieved 2.2 +/- 0.9 h after drug administration and the terminal elimination half-life was 1.7 +/- 1.5 h. Measurable concentrations of CNDAU were first seen 0.60 +/- 0.31 h, peak plasma concentrations were achieved 3.1 +/- 0.9 h after the CS-682 dose, and the terminal elimination half-life was 2.3 +/- 1.7 h. The recommended phase 2 starting dose for the 3 days/week regimen of CS-682 is 160 mg/m2/day for 4 weeks repeated after a 2-week rest period.
16019947	In vitro metabolism of an orally active O-methyl amidoxime prodrug for the treatment of CNS trypanosomiasis. A new aza-analogue of furamidine, 6-[5-(4-amidinophenyl)-furan-2-yl]nicotinamidine (DB820), has potent in vitro antitrypanosomal activity; however, it suffers from poor oral activity because of its positively charged amidine groups. The dimethoxyamidine prodrug of DB820, N-methoxy-6-{5-[4-(N-methoxyamidino)phenyl]-furan-2-yl}-nicotinamidine (DB844), has potent oral activity in mouse models of both early-stage and CNS African trypanosomiasis. Metabolism of DB844 in human liver microsomes (HLM) was investigated using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The metabolism of DB844 in HLM was NADPH-dependent and resulted in the production of eight metabolites over a 90?min incubation. O-Demethylation and N-dehydroxylation reactions resulted in the metabolic conversion of DB844 to its active DB820 metabolite. Chromatographic conditions used for LC-MS analysis allowed for the separation and identification of all metabolites including positional isomers. Demethylation of either the phenyl or pyridine side of DB844 (DB844 m/z 366.2) resulted in the production of two metabolites (M1A, M1B), each with a molecular ion of m/z of 352.3 and MS(2) fragments of 288.1, 305.2, 321.2 and 335.2. However, the intensities of the MS(2) fragments were different among the two isomeric metabolites, and comparison to an authentic standard allowed for the structural determination of each metabolite. The isomeric metabolites M2A and M2B, resulting from amidoxime reductions of M1A and M1B, were also chromatographically separated and had distinguishable MS(2) profiles that allowed for their structural assignments when compared to an authentic standard. The di-amidoxime product resulting from O-demethylation of either side of DB844 was also identified as an abundant metabolite during microsomal incubations. The active antitrypanosomal metabolite, DB820, was the last metabolite to be formed and thus provides evidence that DB844 may effectively be metabolized to its active metabolite in vivo.
15980102	Metabolism and disposition of a potent group II metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist, in rats, dogs, and monkeys. Metabolism and disposition of MGS0028 [(1R,2S,5S,6S)-2-amino-6-fluoro-4-oxobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid monohydrate], a potent group II metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist, were examined in three preclinical species (Sprague-Dawley rats, beagle dogs, and rhesus monkeys). In rats, MGS0028 was widely distributed and primarily excreted in urine as parent and as a single reductive metabolite, identified as the 4R-isomer MGS0034 [(1R,2S,4R,5S,6S)-2-amino-6-fluoro-4-hydroxybicyclo[3.1.0]-hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid]. MGS0028 had a low brain to plasma ratio at efficacious doses in rats and was eliminated more slowly in rat brain than in plasma. Exposure increased proportionally (1--10 mg/kg p.o.) in rats, with bioavailability>60% at all doses. However, bioavailability was only approximately 20% in monkeys, and MGS0034 was found in relatively high abundance in plasma. In dogs, oral bioavailability was >60%, and the metabolite was not detected. In vitro metabolism was examined in liver subcellular fractions (microsomes and cytosol) from rat, dog, monkey, and human. Reductive metabolism was observed in rat, monkey, and human liver cytosol incubations, but not in dog liver cytosol incubations. No metabolism of MGS0028 was detected in incubations with liver microsomes from any species. Similar to in vivo results, MGS0028 was reduced in cytosol stereospecifically to MGS0034. The rank order of in vitro metabolite formation (monkey >> rat approximately human >> dog) was in agreement with in vivo observations in rats, dogs, and monkeys. Based on the observation of species difference in reductive metabolism, rat and monkey were recommended to be the preclinical species for further characterization prior to testing in humans. Finally, allometric scaling predicts that human pharmacokinetic parameters would be acceptable for further development.
15268982	Comparative disposition of [14C]ertapenem, a novel carbapenem antibiotic, in rat, monkey and man. 1. The disposition and metabolism of ertapenem, a carbapenem antibiotic, was examined in rat, monkey and man. Sprague-Dawley rats and Rhesus monkeys were given, by intravenous administration, radiolabelled doses of ertapenem (60 and 30 mg kg(-1), respectively), and healthy normal volunteers received a single fixed dose of 1000 mg. Urine and faeces were collected for determination of total radioactivity. 2. In healthy volunteers, [14C]ertapenem was eliminated by a combination of hydrolytic metabolism to a beta-lactam ring-opened derivative and renal excretion of unchanged drug. Approximately equal amounts were excreted as a beta-lactam ring-opened metabolite and unchanged drug (36.7 and 37.5% of dose, respectively). A secondary amide hydrolysis product accounted for about 1% of the dose in man. About 10% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in faeces, which suggested that a minor fraction underwent biliary and/or intestinal excretion. 3. In animals, a greater fraction of the dose was eliminated via metabolism; excretion of unchanged drug accounted for 17 and 5% of dose in rats and monkeys, respectively. In monkeys, the beta-lactam ring-opened and amide hydrolysis metabolites accounted for 74.8 and 7.59% of the dose, respectively, whereas in rats, these metabolites accounted for 31.9 and 20% of dose, respectively. 4. In vitro studies with fresh rat tissue homogenates indicated that lung and kidney were the primary organs involved in mediating formation of the beta-lactam ring-opened metabolite. The specific inhibitor of dehydropeptidase-I, cilastatin, inhibited the in vivo and in vitro metabolism of ertapenem in rats, which suggested strongly that the hydrolysis of ertapenem in lung and kidney was mediated by this enzyme.
22324379	Species differences in the pharmacokinetics of KW-7158 [(2S)-(+)-3,3,3-Trifluoro-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-N-(5,5,10-trioxo-4,10-dihydrothieno[3,2-c][1]benzothiepin-9-yl)propanamide]: formation of hydrolyzed metabolite in human and animals. Species differences in the pharmacokinetics of KW-7158 [(2S)-(+)-3,3,3-Trifluoro-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-N-(5,5,10-trioxo-4,10-dihydrothieno[3,2-c][1]benzothiepin-9-yl)propanamide] were studied in in vivo and in vitro experiments. The exposure ratio of hydrolyzed metabolite (M2, primary metabolite in human plasma)/KW-7158 was higher than the ratio of thiophen-to-furan converted metabolite (M1)/KW-7158 in human subjects after oral administration, but the mouse, rat and dog studies gave opposite results. M2 was produced in the highest amount by the 9000g supernatant of small intestine, followed by that of liver and kidney in human subjects. After correction for protein contents, the results obtained suggested that the small intestine plays a major role in the metabolism to M2 for the first pass effect after oral administration of KW-7158. The formation of M2 was independent of the presence of NADPH and was inhibited by various esterase inhibitors. These observations suggested that the predominant enzymes or isozymes involved in the formation of M2 are esterases, which differ between humans and animals. Such differences may be one of the reasons for the species differences in the pharmacokinetics of KW-7158 between humans and animals.
21521795	In vitro age-dependent enzymatic metabolism of chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos-oxon in human hepatic microsomes and chlorpyrifos-oxon in plasma. Age-dependent chlorpyrifos (CPF) metabolism was quantified by in vitro product formation in human hepatic microsomes (ages 13 days to 75 years) and plasma (ages 3 days to 43 years) with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Hepatic CPF cytochrome P450 desulfuration [CPF to chlorpyrifos-oxon (CPF-oxon)] and dearylation (CPF to 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol) V(max) values were 0.35 ± 0.21 and 0.73 ± 0.38 nmol · min(-1) · mg microsomal protein (-1) (mean ± S.D.), respectively. The mean (±S.D.) hepatic CPF-oxon hydrolysis (chlorpyrifos-oxonase [CPFOase]) V(max) was 78 ± 44 nmol · min(-1) · mg microsomal protein (-1). None of these hepatic measures demonstrated age-dependent relationships on a per microsomal protein basis using linear regression models. Ratios of CPF bioactivation to detoxification (CPF desulfuration to dearylation) V(max) values were consistent across ages. CPFOase in plasma demonstrated age-dependent increases on a volume of plasma basis, as did total plasma protein levels. Mean (±S.D.) CPF-oxon hydrolysis V(max) values for children <6 months of age and adults (≥16 years) were 1900 ± 660 and 6800 ± 1600 nmol · min(-1) · ml(-1), respectively, and at environmental exposure levels, this high- capacity enzyme is likely to be sufficient even in infants. Plasma samples were phenotyped for paraoxonase status, and frequencies were 0.5, 0.4, and 0.1 for QQ, QR, and RR phenotypes, respectively. These results will be integrated into a physiologically based pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic model for CPF and, once integrated, will be useful for assessing biological response to CPF exposures across life stages.
16581944	Stereoselective metabolism of endosulfan by human liver microsomes and human cytochrome P450 isoforms. Endosulfan (6,7,8,9,10,10-hexachloro-1,5,5a,6,9,9a-hexahydro-6,9-methano-2,3,4-benzo(e)dioxathiepin-3-oxide) is a broad-spectrum chlorinated cyclodiene insecticide. This study was performed to elucidate the stereoselective metabolism of endosulfan in human liver microsomes and to characterize the cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes that are involved in the metabolism of endosulfan. Human liver microsomal incubation of endosulfan in the presence of NADPH resulted in the formation of the toxic metabolite, endosulfan sulfate. The intrinsic clearances (CL(int)) of endosulfan sulfate from beta-endosulfan were 3.5-fold higher than those from alpha-endosulfan, suggesting that beta-endosulfan would be cleared more rapidly than alpha-endosulfan. Correlation analysis between the known P450 enzyme activities and the rate of the formation of endosulfan sulfate in the 14 human liver microsomes showed that alpha-endosulfan metabolism is significantly correlated with CYP2B6-mediated bupropion hydroxylation and CYP3A-mediated midazolam hydroxylation, and that beta-endosulfan metabolism is correlated with CYP3A activity. The P450 isoform-selective inhibition study in human liver microsomes and the incubation study of cDNA-expressed enzymes also demonstrated that the stereoselective sulfonation of alpha-endosulfan is mediated by CYP2B6, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5, and that that of beta-endosulfan is transformed by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. The total CL(int) values of endosulfan sulfate formation catalyzed by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 were consistently higher for beta-endosulfan than for the alpha-form (CL(int) of 0.67 versus 10.46 microl/min/pmol P450, respectively). CYP2B6 enantioselectively metabolizes alpha-endosulfan, but not beta-endosulfan. These findings suggest that the CYP2B6 and CYP3A enzymes are major enzymes contributing to the stereoselective disposition of endosulfan.
15005879	Characterization of enzymes responsible for biotransformation of the new antileukotrienic drug quinlukast in rat liver microsomes and in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes. The promising new drug quinlukast, 4-(4-(quinoline-2'-yl-methoxy)phenylsulphanyl)benzoic acid (VUFB 19363), is under investigation for its anti-inflammatory and anti-asthmatic effects. The main metabolite of quinlukast identified in incubations of rat microsomal fraction, and in primary culture of rat hepatocytes, is quinlukast sulfoxide (M2). Also, several other metabolites of quinlukast were found: two dihydrodiol derivatives (M3, M5) and quinlukast sulfone (M4). This study was conducted to characterize the enzymes involved in quinlukast biotransformation in rat in-vitro. Primary cultures of rat hepatocytes were treated with inducers of different cytochrome P450s (CYPs) for 48 h. Quinlukast (100 microM) was incubated for 24 h in a primary culture of induced or control hepatocytes. The effects of CYP inhibitors, ketoconazole, methylpyrazole, metyrapone and alpha-naphthoflavone (2, 10, 50 microM), on quinlukast metabolism were tested in induced and control hepatocytes. Significant induction of M2 (6 times), M5 (twice) and M3 (by 50%) formation by dexamethasone and strong concentration-dependent inhibition by ketoconazole indicated that CYP3A participates in formation of these metabolites. CYP1A catalyses formation of metabolite M3 mainly, as beta-naphthoflavone induced (10 times) production of M3 and a strong inhibitory effect of alpha-naphthoflavone on its formation was observed. A significant inhibitory effect of quinlukast (2, 10, 50 microM) on ethoxyresorufin, methoxyresorufin and benzyloxyresorufin O-dealkylase activity was observed as well.
14985146	In vivo metabolism of the new designer drug 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)piperazine (MeOPP) in rat and identification of the human cytochrome P450 enzymes responsible for the major metabolic step. 1. The in vivo metabolism of 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)piperazine (MeOPP), a novel designer drug, was studied in male Wistar rats. 2. MeOPP was mainly O-demethylated to 1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)piperazine (4-HO-PP) in addition to degradation of the piperazine moiety. 3. O-demethylation, the major metabolic step, was studied with cDNA-expressed human hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in pooled human liver microsomes (pHLM) and in single donor human liver microsomes with CYP2D6 poor metabolizer genotype (PM HLM). 4. CYP2D6 catalysed O-demethylation with apparent Km and Vmax values of 48.34 +/- 14.48 microM and 5.44 +/- 0.47 pmol min(-1) pmol(-1) CYP, respectively. pHLM catalysed the monitored reaction with an apparent Km = 204.80 +/- 51.81 microM and Vmax = 127.50 +/- 13.25 pmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein. 5. The CYP2D6-specific chemical inhibitor quinidine (1 and 3 microM) significantly inhibited 4-HO-PP formation by 71.9 +/- 4.8% and by 98.5% +/- 0.5%, respectively, in incubation mixtures with pHLM and 200 microM MeOPP. 6. O-demethylation was significantly lower in PM HLM compared with pHLM (70.6% +/- 7.2%). 7. These data suggest that polymorphically expressed CYP2D6 is the enzyme mainly responsible for MeOPP O-demethylation.
12742115	Determination of a new atypical antipsychotic agent perospirone and its metabolite in human plasma by automated column-switching high-performance liquid chromatography. A simple and sensitive column-switching high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with fluorescence detection is described for the quantification of perospirone, a serotonin and dopamine antagonist, and its metabolite ID-15036 in human plasma. The test compounds were extracted from 2 ml of plasma using chloroform-hexane (30:70, v/v) and the extract was injected into a column I (TSK-PW precolumn, 10 micro m, 35 x 4.6 mm I.D.) for clean-up and column II (C(18) STR ODS-II analytical column, 5 micro m, 150 x 4.6 mm I.D.) for separation. The peak was detected using a fluorescence detector set at Ex 315 nm and Em 405 nm, and the total time for a chromatographic separation was approximately 30 min. The method was validated for the concentration range from 0.1 to 100 ng/ml. Mean recoveries were 97% for perospirone and 96% for ID-15036. Intra- and inter-day relative standard deviations were less than 2.8 and 5.3% for perospirone and 2.4 and 4.4% for ID-15036, respectively, at the concentration range from 0.3 to 30 ng/ml. This method shows good specificity with respect to commonly prescribed psychotropic drugs, and it could be successfully applied for pharmacokinetic studies and therapeutic drug monitoring.
14744951	Metabolism of 8-prenylnaringenin, a potent phytoestrogen from hops (Humulus lupulus), by human liver microsomes. The female flowers of hops are used throughout the world as a flavoring agent for beer. Recently, there has been increasing interest in the potential estrogenic properties of hop extracts. Among the possible estrogenic compounds in hops, 8-prenylnaringenin is perhaps most significant due to its high in vitro potency exceeding that of other known phytoestrogens. Since data regarding the pharmacokinetic properties of this compound are lacking, we investigated the in vitro metabolism of 8-prenylnaringenin by human liver microsomes. A total of 12 metabolites were identified, and biotransformation occurred on the prenyl group and the flavanone skeleton. The major site of oxidation was on the terminal methyl groups, and of the two possible isomers, the transisomer was more abundant. The double bond on the prenyl group was also oxidized to an epoxide that was opened by intramolecular reaction with the neighboring hydroxyl group. On the flavanone skeleton, the major site of oxidation was at 3'position on the B ring. Other metabolites included oxidation at carbon-3 as well as desaturation of the C ring to produce 8-prenylapigenin. An unusual hydroxy quinone product formed by ipso hydroxylation of the B ring of 8-prenylnaringenin was also detected. This product was probably an intermediate for the B ring cleavage product, 8-prenylchromone.
18804610	Simultaneous determination of cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime in real urine sample using voltammetric and high-performance liquid chromatographic methods. Two rapid, accurate and sensitive methods are developed and validated for the quantitative simultaneous determination of cefotaxime (CFX) and its active metabolite desacetylcefotaxime (DCFX) in urine. Based on the previous results which showed the four electron reduction of CFX at approximately -0.5 V, and the new findings that DCFX reduction occurred at more positive potential (-0.23 V), the new adsorptive stripping differential pulse voltammetric (AdSDPV) method was developed for determination of CFX in the presence of DCFX. Linear responses were observed over a wide concentration range (0.07-0.52 microg/ml for CFX and 0.22-1.3 microg/ml for DCFX) in urine. The second assay involves subsequent separation on a reversed-phase HPLC column, with ultraviolet detection at 262 nm. Retention times were 4.057 and 1.960 min for CFX and DCFX, respectively. Linear responses were observed over a wide range, 0.55-6.60 microg/ml for CFX and 1.10-11.00 microg/ml for DCFX, in urine. The statistical evaluation for both methods was examined by means of within-day repeatability (n=5) and day-to-day precision (n=3) and was found to be satisfactory with high accuracy and precision.
15124981	Pharmacokinetic model of R-roscovitine and its metabolite in healthy male subjects. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of R-roscovitine, a novel cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, and its carboxylate metabolite in man. Twelve healthy male subjects received single oral doses of 50, 100, 200, 400 or 800 mg in a hierarchical 3-period, 6-sequence crossover design. One dose was given after breakfast, the others under fasting conditions. R-roscovitine and the carboxylate metabolite were measured in plasma and urine. A 2-compartment model for R-roscovitine with 1 compartment for the metabolite and a component for first-pass extraction was adequate. Protein binding was calculated from plasma and urine data. R-roscovitine undergoes nonsaturatable first-pass extraction, rapid metabolism, exhibits high nonsaturated protein binding, is slowly absorbed from the GI tract and is rapidly and extensively distributed into tissues. The slow release of the molecule from tissue determines the apparent terminal half-life. Food delays the absorption and slows down the absorption rate but does not influence bioavailability. The formation rate of the carboxylate is a determinant of the plasma concentrations of this metabolite. It has low protein binding, limited tissue distribution and a renal clearance reflecting with good water solubility. The compartmental analysis clarified important pharmacokinetic aspects relevant for the clinical development of the compound.
19709934	Rapid and sensitive ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the novel anticancer agent PR-104 and its major metabolites in human plasma: Application to a pharmacokinetic study. PR-104 is a dinitrobenzamide mustard currently in clinical trial as a hypoxia-activated prodrug. It is converted systemically to the corresponding alcohol, PR-104A, which is activated by nitroreduction to the hydroxylamine (PR-104H) and amine (PR-104M). PR-104A is also metabolised to the O-glucuronide (PR-104G), and by oxidative debromoethylation to the semi-mustard PR-104S. We now report a validated ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method for the determination of these metabolites in human plasma. Plasma proteins were precipitated with acidified methanol and the supernatant diluted into water. Aliquots were analysed by UHPLC-MS/MS using a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 Rapid Resolution HT (50mmx2.1mm, 1.8microm) column and gradient of acetonitrile and 0.01% formic acid with a 6min run time. The method had a linear range of 0.1-50microM for PR-104, PR-104A and PR-104G, 0.05-5microM for PR-104H, 0.025-2.5microM for PR-104M and 0.01-1microM for PR-104S. The intra-day and inter-day precision and accuracy were within 14%. The extraction recovery of all analytes was over 87%. The validated method was illustrated by using it to study the pharmacokinetics of PR-104 and its metabolites in a human patient.
21703945	Rapid determination of gefitinib and its main metabolite, O-desmethyl gefitinib in human plasma using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A novel, rapid and specific liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the simultaneous quantification of gefitinib and its predominant metabolite, O-desmethyl gefitinib in human plasma. Chromatographic separation of analytes was achieved on an Alltima C18 analytical HPLC column (150 mm × 2.1 mm, 5 μm) using an isocratic elution mode with a mobile phase comprised acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water (30:70, v/v). The flow rate was 300 μL/min. The chromatographic run time was 3 min. The column effluents were detected by API 4000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer using electrospray ionization (ESI) in positive mode. Linearity was demonstrated in the range of 5-1000 ng/mL for gefitinib and 5-500 ng/mL for O-desmethyl gefitinib. The intra- and inter-day precisions for gefitinib and O-desmethyl gefitinib were ≤10.8% and the accuracies ranged from 89.7 to 104.7% for gefitinib and 100.4 to 106.0% for O-desmethyl gefitinib. This method was used as a bioanalytical tool in a phase I clinical trial to investigate the possible effect of hydroxychloroquine on the pharmacokinetics of gefitinib. The results of this study enabled clinicians to ascertain the safety of the combination therapy of hydroxychloroquine and gefitinib in patients with advanced (Stage IIIB-IV) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
17315539	Metabolism of the new anxiolytic agent, a pyrido[1,2-]benzimidazole (PBI) analog (RWJ-53050), in rat and human hepatic S9 fractions, and in dog; identification of cytochrome p450 isoforms mediated in the human microsomal metabolism. The in vitro and in vivo metabolism of RWJ-53050, an anxiolytic agent, was investigated after incubation with rat and human hepatic S9 fractions, and human microsomes and 7 microsomes containing individual human CYP isoforms, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 in the presence of NADPH-generating system, and a single oral dose administration to dogs (30 mg/kg). Unchanged RWJ-53050 (> or = 74% of the sample in vitro; < or = 13% in vivo) plus 16 metabolites were profiled, quantified and tentatively identified based on the API-MS and MS/MS data. The formation of RWJ-53050 metabolites are via the 5 pathways: 1. N/O-demethylation, 2. phenylhydroxylation, 3. pyrido-oxidation, 4. dehydration, and 5. conjugation. Pathway 1 formed O-desmethyl-phenyl-RWJ-53050 (M1, < 1-12% in vitro & in vivo), O-desmethyl-benzimidazole-RWJ-53050 (M2), and N-desmethyl-RWJ-53050 (M3) (M2 & M3, < or = 3% in vitro & in vivo). Pathway 2 generated hydroxy-benzimidazole-RWJ-53050 (M4), hydroxy-phenyl-RWJ-53050 (M5), and hydroxy-phenyl-M4 (M9) (< or = 3% in vitro & in vivo). Pathway 3 formed 2 trace oxidized metabolites, hydroxy-pyrido-RWJ-53050 (M6, < or = 1% in vitro) and oxo-pyrido-RWJ-53050 (M8, < 1% in vitro) and in conjunction with pathway 1 produced 2 trace dioxidized metabolites, OH-benzimidazole-M6 (M10) and OH-benzimidazole-M8 (M11) (in vitro). Pathway 4 formed a minor dehydrated metabolite of M6 (M7, 3%, in vitro). Pathway 5 produced 3 in vivo conjugates, M1-glucuronide (M14, 17%), M5-glucuronide (M15, 50%), and M5-sulfate (M16, 10%). RWJ-53050 is substantially metabolized in vitro in the rat and human, and extensively metabolized in vivo in the dog. CYP1A2, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the formation of oxidized metabolites, M1, M2, M4, M5 and M9.
20187082	Identification of NTBC metabolites in urine from patients with hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 using two different mass spectrometric platforms: triple stage quadrupole and LTQ-Orbitrap. The objective of our work was to identify known and unknown metabolites of the drug NTBC (2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione) in urine from patients during the treatment of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT-1) disease, a severe inborn error of tyrosine metabolism. Two different mass spectrometric techniques, a triple stage quadrupole and an LTQ-Orbitrap (Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FTMS)), were used for the identification and the structural elucidation of the detected metabolites. Initially, the mass spectrometric (MS) approach consisted of the precursor ion scan detection of the selected product ions, followed by the corresponding collision-induced dissociation (CID) fragmentation analysis (MS(2)) for the targeted selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. Subsequently, accurate and high-resolution full scan and MS/MS measurements were performed on the possible metabolites using the LTQ-Orbitrap. Final confirmation of the identified metabolites was achieved by measuring commercially supplied or laboratory-synthesized standards. Altogether six metabolites, including NTBC itself, were extracted, detected and identified. In addition, two new NTBC metabolites were unambiguously identified as amino acid conjugates, namely glycine-NTBC and beta-alanine-NTBC. These identifications were based on their characteristics of chromatographic retention times, protonated molecular ions, elemental compositions, product ions (using CID and higher-energy C-trap dissociation (HCD) techniques) and synthesized references. The applied MS strategy, based on two different MS platforms (LC/MS/MS and FTMS), allowed the rapid identification analysis of the drug metabolites from human extracts and could be used for pharmaceutical research and drug development.
17592613	Enantioselective separation of the novel antidepressant mirtazapine and its main metabolites by CEC. In this work, the simultaneous enantioseparation of the second-generation antidepressant drug mirtazapine and its main metabolites 8-hydroxymirtazapine and N-desmethylmirtazapine by chiral CEC is reported. The separation of all enantiomers under study was achieved employing a capillary column packed with a vancomycin-modified diol stationary phase. With the aim to optimize the separation of the three pairs of enantiomers in the same run, different experimental parameters were studied including the mobile phase composition (buffer concentration and pH, organic modifier type and ratio, and water content), stationary phase composition, and capillary temperature. A capillary column packed with vancomycin mixed with silica particles in the ratio (3:1) and a mobile phase composed of 100 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 6)/H(2)O/MeOH/ACN (5:15:30:50, by vol.) allowed the complete enantioresolution of each pair of enantiomers but not the simultaneous separation of all the studied compounds. For this purpose, a packing bed composed of vancomycin-CSP only was tested and the baseline resolution of the three couples of enantiomers was achieved in a single run in less than 30 min, setting the applied voltage and temperature at 25 kV and 20 degrees C, respectively. In order to show the potential applicability of the developed CEC method to biomedical analysis, a study concerning precision, sensitivity, and linearity was performed. The method was then applied to the separation of the enantiomers in a human urine sample spiked with the studied compounds after suitable SPE procedure with strong cation-exchange (SCX) cartridges.
20149761	Identification and quantitative determination of a major circulating metabolite of gambogic acid in human. Gambogic acid (GA), a promising anticancer candidate, is a polyprenylated xanthone abundant in the resin of Garcinia morella and Garcinia hanburyi. The major circulating metabolite of GA in human, 10-hydroxygambogic acid (10-OHGA), was identified by comparison of the retention time and mass spectra with those of reference standard using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The reference standard of 10-OHGA was isolated from bile samples of rats after intravenous injection of GA injection, and its structure was confirmed by NMR. Then, a selective and sensitive method was developed for the quantitative determination of this metabolite in human plasma. After liquid-liquid extraction by ethyl acetate, the analyte and the internal standard were separated on a Sepax HPC18 column (100 mm x 2.1 mm i.d., 3.0 microm) with a mobile phase of 10mM ammonium acetate water solution containing 0.1% formic acid-acetonitrile (20:80, v/v). The detection was performed on a single quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with electrospray ionization (ESI) source. The calibration curve was linear over the range of 3-2000 ng/mL for 10-OHGA. The developed quantification method can now be used for the pharmacokinetic and pharmacological studies of 10-OHGA after intravenous infusion of GA injection in human.
19845430	Deactivation of anti-cancer drug letrozole to a carbinol metabolite by polymorphic cytochrome P450 2A6 in human liver microsomes. Cytochromes P450 (P450) involved in letrozole metabolism were investigated. Among 13 recombinant P450 forms examined, only P450 2A6 and 3A4 showed activities in transforming letrozole to its carbinol metabolite with small K(m) and high Vmax values yielding apparent Vmax/K(m) values of 0.48 and 0.24 nl min(-1) nmol(-1) P450, respectively. The metabolic activities of individual human liver microsomes showed a significant correlation with coumarin 7-hydroxylase activities (P450 2A6 marker) at a letrozole concentration of 0.5 microM, while a good correlation was also seen with testosterone 6beta-hydroxylase activities (P450 3A4 marker) at 5 microM substrate concentration with different inhibition by 8-methoxypsolaren. Significantly low carbinol-forming activities were seen in human liver microsomes from individuals possessing CYP2A6*4/*4 (whole CYP2A6 gene deletion) at a letrozole concentration of 0.5 microM. A Vmax/K(m) value measured for CYP2A6.7 (amino acid substitution type) in human liver microsomes, in the presence of anti-P450 3A4 antibodies, was approximately seven-fold smaller than that for CYP2A6.1 (wild-type). These results demonstrate that P450 2A6 and 3A4 catalyse the conversion of letrozole to its carbinol metabolite in vitro at low and high concentrations of letrozole. Polymorphic variation of CYP2A6 is considered to be relevant to inter-subject variation in therapeutic exposure of letrozole.
18548464	Nonclinical pharmacokinetics of BMS-292655, a water-soluble prodrug of the antifungal ravuconazole. The phosphate ester, BMS-292655, was developed as a water-soluble prodrug of the antifungal agent, ravuconazole (BMS-207147). BMS-292655 was comparatively stable in rat, beagle dog, cynomolgus monkey and human plasma, but was hydrolysed upon incubation with liver S9 preparations from all species. The major product in rat, monkey and human S9 was BMS-207147, while in dog S9, the intermediate ester, BMS-300043, predominated. BMS-300043 itself was more stable in dog S9 than in S9 preparations from the other species. Intravenous administration of BMS-292655 to rats, beagle dogs and cynomolgus monkeys indicated species differences in the extent of formation of BMS-207147 (monkeys>rats>dogs). The lower overall generation of BMS-207147 in dogs was consistent with the presence of circulating plasma levels of BMS-300043. BMS-300043 was present in monkey plasma but not detectable in rat plasma. The conversion of BMS-292655 to BMS-207147 in the presence of human S9 indicated the potential for BMS-292655 to function as a BMS-207147 prodrug in humans. The similarity in the hydrolysis of BMS-292655 when incubated with human and monkey S9 in vitro, coupled with the effective release of BMS-207147 from BMS-292655 upon i.v. administration to monkeys, is consistent with this conclusion.
17913896	Pharmacokinetic profile of temsirolimus with concomitant administration of cytochrome p450-inducing medications. Temsirolimus is a novel inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin, with antitumor activity in advanced tumors. Because temsirolimus and its metabolite, sirolimus, are cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4/5 substrates, the potential exists for interaction with drugs that induce CYP3A activity, including enzyme inducers and rifampin. Cancer patients received once-weekly intravenous (IV) 220 mg/m(2) temsirolimus with or without enzyme inducers. Coadministration with enzyme inducers decreased temsirolimus maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) by 36% and increased volume of distribution by 99%. Sirolimus C(max) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) were decreased by 67% and 43%, respectively. In healthy adult subjects, coadministration of 25-mg intravenous temsirolimus with rifampin had no significant effect on temsirolimus C(max) and AUC but decreased sirolimus C(max) and AUC by 65% and 56%, respectively. Rifampin decreased AUC(sum) by 41%. Temsirolimus was well tolerated in both studies. If concomitant agents with CYP3A induction potential are used, higher temsirolimus doses may be needed to achieve adequate tumor tissue drug levels.
20739639	Metabolism of vabicaserin in mice, rats, dogs, monkeys, and humans. Vabicaserin is a potent 5-hydroxytryptamine(2C) agonist that is currently being developed for the treatment of the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia. In this study, in vitro and in vivo metabolism of vabicaserin was evaluated in mice, rats, dogs, monkeys, and humans, and the structures of the metabolites were characterized by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. Vabicaserin underwent three major metabolic pathways in vitro: NADPH-dependent hydroxylation, NADPH-independent imine formation, and carbamoyl glucuronidation. After a single oral dose, vabicaserin was extensively metabolized in animals and humans, and its metabolites were mainly excreted via the urine in mice and rats. Along with the metabolites observed in vitro, secondary metabolism via oxidation and conjugation of the primary metabolites generated from the above-mentioned three pathways yielded a number of additional metabolites in vivo. Carbamoyl glucuronidation was the major metabolic pathway in humans but a minor pathway in rats. Although carbamoyl glucuronidation was a major metabolic pathway in mice, dogs, and monkeys, oxidative metabolism was also extensive in these species. Hydroxylation occurred in all species, although different regional selectivity was apparent. The imine pathway also appeared to be common to several species, because vabicaserin imine was observed in humans and hydroxyl imine metabolites were observed in mice, rats, and dogs. A nitrone metabolite of vabicaserin was observed in dogs and humans but not in other species. In conclusion, the major metabolic pathways for vabicaserin in humans and nonclinical safety species include carbamoyl glucuronidation, hydroxylation, formation of an imine, and a nitrone.
17001612	Diacetyldiamidoximeester of pentamidine, a prodrug for treatment of protozoal diseases: synthesis, in vitro and in vivo biotransformation. Pentamidine is an effective antimicrobial agent. To increase its poor oral bioavailability due to the strong basic amidine functionality, the less basic O-acetylamidoxime prodrug, the diacetyldiamidoximeester, was used, which has greatly improved lipophilicity. The objectives of this investigation were the synthesis of all potential metabolites of the double prodrug, the conformational analysis of its structure, and to study the in vitro and in vivo biotransformation by ester cleavage and N-reduction to pentamidine via four intermediate metabolites. The biotransformation of diacetyldiamidoximeester to pentamidine involving the reduction of the amidoxime function and the ester cleavage could be demonstrated. The kinetic parameters were determined. Amidoximes were efficiently metabolized by several enzyme systems located in microsomes and mitochondria of different organs including the final formation of the active metabolite pentamidine. The formation of pentamidine after oral administration of the diacetyldiamidoximeester to rats could be demonstrated as well.
21963275	In vitro metabolic stability and metabolite profiling of TJ0711 hydrochloride, a newly developed vasodilatory β-blocker, using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. In this paper, a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the simultaneous analysis of metabolic stability and metabolite profiling of 1-[4-(2-methoxyethyl) phenoxy]-3-[[2-(2-methoxyphenoxy) ethyl]amino]-2-propanol hydrochloride (TJ0711 HCl), a new vasodilatory β-blocker. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was used as a survey scan to quantify the parent compound and to trigger the acquisition of enhanced product ions (EPI) for the identification of formed metabolites. In addition, comparison between MRM-only and MRM-information dependent acquisition-EPI (MRM-IDA-EPI) methods was conducted to determine analytical variables, including linearity, limit of detection (LOD), lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), as well as intra-day and inter-day accuracy and precision. Results demonstrated that MRM-IDA-EPI quantitative analysis was not affected by the addition of EPI scans to obtain qualitative information during the same chromatographic run, compared to MRM-only method. Thereafter, metabolic stability and metabolite identification of TJ0711 HCl were investigated using human liver microsomes (HLM) by the MRM-IDA-EPI method. The in vitro metabolic stability parameters were calculated and t(1/2), microsomal intrinsic clearance (CL(int)), as well as hepatic CL, were 13.0 min, 106.5 μL/min/mg microsomal protein, and 1082.2 mL/min, respectively. The major formed metabolites were also simultaneously monitored and the metabolite profiling data demonstrated that this MRM-IDA-EPI method was capable of targeting a large number of metabolites, in which demethylation and hydroxylation were the principle metabolism pathways during the in vitro incubation with HLM.
15089099	Characterization of glutathione conjugates of the remoxipride hydroquinone metabolite NCQ-344 formed in vitro and detection following oxidation by human neutrophils. Remoxipride is an atypical antipsychotic displaying selective binding to the dopamine D2 receptor. Several cases of aplastic anemia led to the withdrawal of remoxipride from the market in December 1993. The remoxipride metabolite NCQ-344 is a hydroquinone while the structural isomer NCQ-436 is a catechol, both of which have been suggested to be capable of forming a reactive para- and ortho-quinone, respectively. Recently, these two remoxipride metabolites were shown to induce apoptosis in human bone marrow progenitor cells. Furthermore, NCQ-344 also caused necrosis of these cells unlike NCQ-436. Although NCQ-344 has been detected in plasma of humans dosed with remoxipride, to date, no experimental evidence for the formation of the corresponding para-quinone has been obtained. Here, we report the detection of three glutathione (GSH) conjugates of NCQ-344 in vitro that were formed following a chemical reaction and characterized by tandem mass spectrometry and for a cyclized conjugate additionally with derivatization and deuterium exchange. In contrast, NCQ-436 did not form a GSH conjugate. Hypochlorous acid oxidized NCQ-344 to the para-quinone while NCQ-436 was resistant to oxidation. Upon incubation with NCQ-344, stimulated human neutrophils produced from 2- to 5-fold greater amounts of glutathione conjugates than unstimulated neutrophils. Ab initio calculations on these remoxipride metabolites indicated that the reaction leading to the respective quinone was spontaneous for the para-quinone (e.g., from NCQ-344) while ortho-quinone (e.g., from NCQ-436) formation was not. These results demonstrate that NCQ-344 is capable of facile formation of a reactive para-quinone capable of reacting with GSH and may rationalize previous findings regarding the biological effects observed in vitro with these two remoxipride metabolites.
11397393	Metabolism and molecular toxicology of isoprene. Isoprene (2-methylbuta-1,3-diene) is a large-scale petrochemical used principally in the manufacture of synthetic rubbers. It is also produced by plants and trees and is the major endogenous hydrocarbon formed by mammals, probably from mevalonic acid. Isoprene is metabolised by mammals in processes that involve epoxidation by cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases to the isomeric mono-epoxides, (1-methylethenyl)-oxirane and 2-ethenyl-2-methyloxirane. Further metabolism of the mono-epoxides to mutagenic isoprene di-epoxides, (2, 2')-2-methylbioxiranes, can also occur. The oxidations to the mono- and di-epoxides occur enantioselectively and diastereoselectively. The mono-epoxides are hydrolysed enantioselectively to vicinal diols under catalysis by epoxide hydrolase. 2-Ethenyl-2-methyloxirane is also readily hydrolysed non-enzymatically. Because of the stereochemical possibilities for metabolites, the metabolism of isoprene is complex. The metabolism of isoprene by liver microsomes in vitro from a range of species including rat, mouse and human shows significant differences between species, strains and gender in respect of the diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity of the metabolic oxidation and hydrolysis reactions. The impact of the extra methyl in isoprene on di-epoxide reactivity also appears to be critically important for the resulting biological effects. Isoprene di-epoxides may exhibit a lower cross-linking potential in vivo compared to butadiene di-epoxides. Differences in metabolism and reactivity of metabolites may be factors contributing to the significant differences in toxicological response to isoprene observed between species.
15187407	Four new andrographolide metabolites in human urine. Andrographolide is one of principal components of a famous traditional Chinese herbal medicine Andrographis paniculate (BURM) NEES. Four new metabolites of andrographolide were isolated from human urine. All of them were characterized as sulfate and one of them also as a cysteine S-conjugate. The structures were determined to be andrographolide-3-O-sulfate (M-1), isoandrographolide-3-O-sulfate (M-2), 14-deoxyandrographolide-3-O-sulfate (M-3), 14-deoxy-12-(cysteine-S-yl)-andrographolide-3-O-sulfate (M-4), respectively, based on chemical evidence and spectroscopic analyses.
