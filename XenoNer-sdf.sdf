In this study the suitability of a published cryopreservation technique on dog, monkey and human hepatocytes has been examined and the cells were tested for functionality directly after thawing and subsequent to culture using steroid metabolism and hormone responsiveness of glycogen phosphorylase a. 

$$$$

Monkey and human hepatocytes appear to survive the freezing and thawing process better than dog cells-the latter losing the ability to respond to adrenergic stimuli and their ability to maintain steroid metabolism in culture.

Although monkey and human cells do preserve their steroid metabolising capacity after freeze/thawing, there is not the significant increase in enzyme activity seen during culturing freshly isolated cells.

New, potent and highly specific aromatase inhibitors effectively inhibit peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogens (Cancer Res. 53: 4563, 1993) as well as intratumour aromatase, median aromatase activity being 89% lower in the tissue from patients pretreated with aromatase inhibitor 7 days prior to surgery (P < 0.001).

We investigated factors which could influence the results of the TPMT activity measurement.

$$$$

We tested twelve 6-TG and four 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) compounds from different suppliers as substrates and determined the enzyme kinetic parameters Km and Vmax.

Furthermore, we studied the influence of different 6-TG compounds on the affinity of the methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to the TPMT enzyme.

All 6-TG products were of equal purity (declared >98% by the supplier): this was ascertained by HPLC.

However, the rate of methylation obtained following incubation with 6-TG from different suppliers ranged from 10% to 100% when incubated with the same RBC lysate.

The lowest apparent Km value for a 6-TG was 22.3 micromol x l(-1), while the product with the highest methylation rate showed a Km of 156 micromol x l(-1).

From these results we assume that there is a contaminant in some 6-TG products, which acts as a strong inhibitor of TPMT activity.

Using 6-MP from different suppliers as substrate resulted in Km values ranging from 110 to 162 micromol x l(-1) and Vmox values ranging from 54 to 68 nmol 6-MMP x g(-1)Hb x h(-1).

$$$$

The Km value for the methyl donor SAM was similar to and independent from the thiopurine substrates tested (range 4.9-11 micromol-l(-1) SAM).

In contrast to other investigators, we found non-enzymatic S-methylation, which was negligible under our assay conditions (3% with 128 micromol x l(-1) SAM), but could become relevant in experiments using higher SAM concentrations.

Zanamivir at concentrations up to 500 mumol/L (150 mg/L) had no effect on the metabolism of the CYP probe substrates bufuralol, chlorzoxazone, coumarin, ethoxyresorufin, mephenytoin, midazolam, phenacetin and tolbutamide by human liver microsomes.

$$$$

The binding of zanamivir 0.05 to 10 mg/L to human, dog and rat red blood cells and plasma proteins was low.

The in vitro potency of zanamivir against influenza virus in Madin Darby canine kidney cells was not adversely affected by aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) 1.2 mmol/L, paracetamol (acetaminophen) 6.6 mmol/L, ibuprofen 243 mumol/L, phenylephrine 6 mmol/L, oxymetazoline 380 mumol/L, promethazine 35 mumol/L and co-amoxiclav (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid) 1.66 mmol/L.

$$$$

These data suggest the following: (i) there is no theoretical basis for expecting metabolic interactions between zanamivir and other coadministered compounds; (ii) zanamivir is unlikely to interact with coadministered compounds that are protein bound; and (iii) commonly coadministered drugs will not interfere with the antiviral activity of zanamivir in vivo.

Although none of these in vitro or in vivo studies were exhaustive, and although none were performed in humans, all the data are consistent with zanamivir having a very low potential for interactions with coadministered drugs in the clinical setting.

The median (25% and 75% quartiles, respectively) oral clearance of C was 12.7 L/hr (11.6, 30.6) in Japanese patients receiving C monotherapy, 18.1 L/hr (5.6, 31.8) in Japanese patients receiving C plus BZDs, 62.7 L/hr (40.0, 90.6) in Swedish patients receiving C monotherapy, and 56.5 L/hr (34.3, 74.1) in Swedish patients receiving C plus BZDs.

When combining all populations in a linear multiple regression, clearance was correlated with ethnic group (p < 0.00001) and age (p < 0.0005), but it was uncorrelated with gender, body weight, and administration of BZDs.

The C/DC plasma concentration ratios were 1.08 in Japanese patients receiving C monotherapy, 0.90 in Japanese patients receiving C plus BZDs, 0.51 in Swedish patients receiving C monotherapy, and 0.49 in Swedish patients receiving C plus BZDs.

The performance of laboratories that quantified at least one substance (33.8% and 34.6% out of the total laboratories in surveys 1 and 2, respectively) is reported as a function of the analytic technique applied for quantification, the number of parameters investigated, the precision and accuracy of results obtained, and the influence of availability of reference material, including deuterated drug-standard analogue solutions provided in survey 2.

Role of human liver microsomal CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in catalyzing N-dechloroethylation of cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide.

$$$$

Parent

The anticancer alkylating agents cyclophosphamide (CPA) and ifosfamide (IFA) are prodrugs that undergo extensive P450-catalyzed metabolism to yield both active (4-hydroxylated) and therapeutically inactive but neurotoxic (N-dechloroethylated) metabolites.

Whereas the human liver microsomal P450 catalysts of CPA and IFA 4-hydroxylation are well characterized, the P450 enzyme catalysts of the alternative N-dechloroethylation pathway are poorly defined.

Parent

Analysis of a panel of fifteen human P450 cDNAs in the baculovirus expression system ('Supersomes') demonstrated that CYP3A4 exhibited the highest N-dechloroethylation activity toward both CPA and IFA, whereas CYP2B6 displayed high N-dechloroethylation activity toward IFA, but not CPA.

The contributions of each human P450 to overall liver microsomal N-dechloroethylation were calculated using a recently described relative substrate-activity factor method, and were found to be in excellent agreement with the results of inhibition studies using the CYP3A inhibitor troleandomycin and an inhibitory monoclonal antibody to CYP2B6.

$$$$

Parent

With CPA as substrate, CYP3A4 was shown to catalyze >/=95% of liver microsomal N-dechloroethylation, whereas with IFA as substrate, CYP3A4 catalyzed an average of approximately 70% of liver microsomal N-dechloroethylation (range = 40-90%), with the balance of this activity catalyzed by CYP2B6 (range = 10-70%, dependent on the CYP2B6 content of the liver).

Because CYP2B6 can make a significant contribution to human liver microsomal IFA N-dechloroethylation, but only a minor contribution to IFA 4-hydroxylation, the selective inhibition of hepatic CYP2B6 activity in individuals with a high hepatic CYP2B6 content may provide a useful approach to minimize the formation of therapeutically inactive but toxic N-dechloroethylated IFA metabolites.

We investigated 107 urine and 78 serum samples of a total of 107 inpatients in 4 groups: (1) 33 inpatients in acute alcohol withdrawal and long term treatment; (2/3) 29 and 15 addicted forensic psychiatric inpatients (#64 StGB, penal code); (4) 30 recently detoxified inpatients of a station for long term treatment by LC/MS-MS with the internal standard d5-EtG and additionally in the fourth group of patients also by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS).

In 2 out of 29 and in 1 out of 15 forensic inpatients of group 2 and 3, respectively--where neither clinical impression nor routine laboratory findings gave an indication for relapse--concentrations of EtG ranged between 0.1 and 18 mg/l in urine.

The effect and clinical significance of tolcapone withdrawal on erythrocyte catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) activity, levodopa pharmacokinetics, and levodopa requirements were investigated in 59 patients with fluctuating parkinsonism who were randomized to receive placebo or tolcapone 100 or 200 mg three times daily for 6 weeks.

The authors discuss different criteria for suspecting oral use of salbutamol, taking into account the data obtained by application of two conventional screening procedures for doping control: gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

Urine samples obtained after administration of oral and inhaled salbutamol to asthmatic and nonasthmatic swimmers were analyzed using both analytical approaches.

$$$$
>  <CLASS>
Chemical

As expected, concentrations obtained by the ELISA test (detection of total salbutamol) were higher than those obtained using the GC/MS procedure (detection of nonsulfated salbutamol).

$$$$

Chemical

>  <TARGET>
After oral administration, the ELISA test detected significantly higher salbutamol concentrations than those detected after inhalation, reflecting the greater doses administered orally.

$$$$

Urine samples with total salbutamol greater than 1400 ng/mL were obtained after oral doses, but no sample reached this value after inhaled doses.

$$$$

Higher concentrations of nonsulfated salbutamol have also been detected after oral intake, although there is an overlap between the distributions of concentrations after oral and inhaled doses.

$$$$

Chemical

>  <TARGET>
A cut-off concentration of 500 ng/mL can be used for nonsulfated salbutamol to select suspicious samples, giving 11.8% false negative results and 4.3% false positive results.

$$$$

An additional criterion evaluated was the androsterone-salbutamol peak height ratio, which was lower after oral doses because of the higher concentrations of salbutamol in urine.

$$$$

This ratio was lower than 2 for all the samples collected after oral administration, although 6.8% false positive samples resulted because of low concentrations of androsterone in female urine.
