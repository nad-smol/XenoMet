XenoMet corpus materials

In this repository four files of XenoMet corpus ("corpus" folder)  are provided:
1. **texts_XenoMet**: texts of publication titles and abstract bodies written with their PubMed identifiers (PMID) tab-separated
2. **entities_XenoMet**: chemical and reaction named entities mentioned in the text with verified manually annotations. These annonations include the following fields: (1) PMID of the corpus text from which chemical or reaction named entity was extracted, (2) chemical or reaction named entity (string, as it mentioned in the text), (3) serial number of the chemical or reaction named entity first character (it is assumed that the index of the first character of the text is 0), (4) serial numbaer of the chemical or reaction named entity last character (it is assumed that the index of the first character of the text is 0), (5) serial number of the chemical or reaction named entity within the text in the format _T[number]_, (6) class of chemical or reaction named entity (_Substrate_, _Metabolite_, _Chemical_, _Reaction_)
3. **relations_XenoMet**: manually annotated associations between extracted chemical and reactions named entities. These annotations include the following fields: (1) PMID of the corpus text from which relation was extracted, (2) pair of associated named entities in the format _T[number of the first chemical named entity]:T[number of the second chemical named entity]_, (3) class of extracted association (_Substrate and its metabolite_, _Synonyms_), (4) reaction named entity which leads to biotransformation of substrate into metabolite - if present in the text, otherwise this field contains _"NA"_, (5) reaction named entity serial number - if present, otherwise this field contains _"NA"_
4. **XenoMet-sdf-upd**: sentences categorized to the following classes: (1) "Substrate and its metabolite", (2) "Substrate", (3) "Metabolite", (4) "Chemical", (5) "NONE". Represented in the SDF format, applicable for MultiPASS programm.

Moreover, we provide scrip for categorization of chemical named entities to substrates or metabolites and extraction of "substrate-metabolite" pairs from texts (rule-based approach) - "scripts" folder. Dictionary of "basic" reactions used for recognition of reaction named entities is also provided - reactions-unified.txt ("corpus" folder).
